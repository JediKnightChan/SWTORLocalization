Players now have a new option: PvE or PvP Focus. By setting your Focus, you will be placed in an appropriate instance. PvE instances will play like the game does normally. While in a PvP instance you will be flagged for player-vs-player combat. This will allow opposing faction players to attack you, and you them.</text>

You can change your focus at any time by clicking on the drop-down located below your minimap. Changing your focus will, in most cases, immediately transfer you to the appropriate instance.
