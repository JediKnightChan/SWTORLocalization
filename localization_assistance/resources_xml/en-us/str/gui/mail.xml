For those still preparing to battle the galaxy's newest threat, the Eternal Empire, we've streamlined our core leveling experience tremendously--not only will you level faster, but your adventures focus on those missions that truly define your character.

If you can't wait to experience the storyline for Knights of the Fallen Empire, we've given all our subscribers the ability to create a new level 60 character for free. You can do so at Character Select.

For those of you who already have a level 60 character and have completed your class story arc, your epic adventure continues as you travel deep into Wild Space and witness the power of the Eternal Empire firsthand! Will you be able to stop this mysterious new enemy?

But you won't have to face it alone--your Companions are more powerful than ever. Not only will new personalities join your crew, your Companions also have the ability to adapt to whatever needs you have, be it as a tank, a healer, or a damage dealer. 

When you're ready to face the Eternal Empire, go to your ship's Mission Console.

Fight alongside the new Twi'lek Pirate Companion, Paxton Rall, the most notorious pirate to rise to fame across the galaxy since the invasion of the Eternal Empire. Paxton and his crew scour the stars in an endless hunt for adventure and profit, making him a formidable ally in your Alliance! 

You can encounter Paxton and learn more about him on the planet of Odessen after completing Chapter Nine of the Knights of the Fallen Empire expansion. If you'd like to begin traveling with him immediately, you can use the attached item to unlock Paxton as a Companion at any time. Using this item will not prevent you from playing through his recruitment mission.
