Thanks for letting me join the team! Gosh, I feel like the luckiest droid alive to be a part of the Alliance. When HK said his master was a noble paragon of galactic justice, he sure wasn't kidding!

I was so eager to start helping, I swept the base and found three bugs. And they're all Shroud technology! I guess that means I put them there... but at least I got rid of them!

Anyway, I'll patrol the perimeter tonight with HK. He says if I work really hard, I can become his deputy. I'm so excited! Talk to you soon, friend!</text>

I was in charge of the patrol sent to shut down the Shroud's operations on the Coil. While we were there, we found a Twi'lek locked in a closet. Weird stuff. I felt bad for the poor blind sod, so I offered him a job. He'll be in charge of cleaning duty on Odessen.

Anyway, I should warn you this Jollo character plans to save all his Alliance earnings to buy the Coil from us. Says he finally got used to the layout of the place, so he'd eventually like to go back. I highly doubt he'll save enough for that base, but stranger things have happened.

He also asked me to pass his undying gratitude along to HK-55. Whatever that means.</text>

From what I understand, this replicator droid was none other than the Shroud. Yet not a single record of the Shroud's activity is stored in its memory banks. In fact, no memory data exists at all, save for its escapades with our assassin droid. Its memory core is clearly damaged.

However--and here's the truly interesting part--its personality matrix was not reset to the factory default, as it should have been when the memory was wiped. Instead, it seems to have constructed an entirely new personality and morality algorithm on its own. Utterly fascinating.

I will continue to run tests.</text>

To all my sisters:

We have been graced with a great gift: for the first time in our existence, each of us is free to choose our destiny. Many of you have chosen to leave Zakuul--to explore, to travel, simply to be. I do not begrudge you that choice. But many of us choose to stay.

The Great Mother who liberated us is not finished. Freeing us was only the first step in something much greater. I do not know what lies ahead, but I believe it will be transcendent.

For now, I have stabilized the patient's cardiac and respiratory rate. I've also conducted a battery of revolutionary tests, and the results hint at a discovery that will bring the entire scientific community to its knees.

Many of my lesser colleagues believe the Force exists outside the realm of scientific study. This is not so. With time, the cause of Senya's coma, like any other biological mystery, will reveal itself to me.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="282" id2="910336" version="1065353216">One day before the attack, Alliance operatives Theron Shan and Sana-Rae arrived on Voss. Their mission was to meet an informant who claimed to have intel on Arcann's whereabouts. Unfortunately, the Eternal Empire's surprise attack sabotaged their rendezvous and incited worldwide panic. The informant went into hiding or perished, but their actions unwittingly helped the Alliance establish a vital early foothold on Voss.

Thanks to Shan's alert, the Alliance scrambled the fleet and responded in record time to the defense of Voss. Our ships were outnumbered, but we successfully engaged the Eternal Fleet. Meanwhile, the Alliance Commander led a strike team aboard a stolen Zakuulan shuttle. Disguised as one of Vaylin's own, they charged through the blockade and landed in the Voss capital city to lead the ground offensive.

The Sith Empire provided the final support we needed. Under Empress Acina's command, their ships drove off the wounded Eternal Fleet. The battle for Voss ended in an Alliance victory.

Recommendations: Increase Alliance patrols in the Outer Rim. Push Voss to join the Alliance for its own safety. Double number of action-ready Alliance forces to improve our response time to Vaylin's next strike.</text>

Source: An Analysis of the New Galactic Order; Subsection 3.1 - The Implications of Changing Loyalties
 
The previously unforeseeable partnership between the Alliance and the Sith Empire suggests that the Republic, in an effort to regain independence, should throw its support behind this new axis of powers. However, given Zakuul's military might, this axis is expected to be short-lived. The general consensus is that the defeat of these rebellious factions will benefit the Republic in the long term, provided we are careful to distance ourselves from these events.

In the view of this committee, the more prudent strategy is the one we currently employ: appeasement of, and obedience to, the Eternal Empire.</text>

Re: Empress Acina and the Alliance Commander

As you suspected, the Sith followed their gambit on Voss with an offer to join forces with the  Alliance... an offer that was rejected. It remains to be seen whether this is good or bad for the Republic. Too many questions remain unanswered.

Did the Alliance reject Acina because they feel sympathetic to the Republic cause? Are they a potential ally? Or is the Commander simply determined to reject--and eventually eliminate--all potential rivals on the galactic scene? Is the Alliance a greater threat to the Republic than we realize?  

These questions may not even matter. I still believe Vaylin will bring both Acina and the Alliance Commander to heel. For now, our best strategy is to bide our time and continue to pay tribute to the Eternal Throne.</text>

On behalf of the Republic, I wish to apologize for the deplorable actions of former Chancellor Saresh. I assure you that she does not represent the views of the current Senate or myself. We strongly condemn everything she has done.

Though many of your people defected from our ranks, the Republic respects the sovereignty of your Alliance. You have my word that we will make no efforts to undermine or subvert your authority, and I expect you will extend us the same courtesy.

Finally, if you fear I am writing to petition leniency on Saresh's behalf, you need not worry. The former chancellor was not well-liked among the Republic's upper echelons.

Your execution of former Republic chancellor Saresh puts me in a bind. As the Republic's leader, I have no choice but to publically condemn such actions. You may even see holorecordings of a speech where I paint you in a rather unpleasant light. I already regret my colorful language.

But let it be known--from one leader to another--that I personally have nothing but the deepest respect and admiration for your bold actions.

Saresh was a blight on the Republic, and I'm better off--we are all better off--without her poisoning our way of life. You have my sincere thanks for ending her reign of deception, and my deepest apologies for the unsavory names I am about to call you in my next speech.

Sightings are concentrated in Hutt Space, though his exact location and activities remain a mystery. I have received reports of Arcann infiltrating the Hutt Cartel, uniting the orphans of Nar Shaddaa, and even returning to Voss as a Mystic. There is also a rather persistent rumor that he operates a pleasure barge on Hutta.

Though none of these stories are true, they do show a noticeable trend: opinions of Arcann have improved since his exile from Zakuul. This makes it all the more important we locate him soon. If he gains public support, there is no telling what kind of force the former emperor could rally.</text>

SCORPIO wasn't motivated by the rewards that drive others to treason. She didn't side with Vaylin for greed, power, politics, or even revenge. She had her own agenda, and that was always my greatest concern.

I cannot fathom the damage she would have wrought on the galaxy if you'd left her in control of Iokath. In the end, I fear she could have become a greater threat than Vaylin.

I once thought we'd be together forever. Then you did things I just couldn't accept. Things I never believed you would do. I'm not sure what changed. Maybe nothing. Maybe I was slow to see the truth because I didn't want to. 

I know I hurt you when I betrayed the Alliance, but in my mind you'd already betrayed me with your actions. I won't apologize for putting Zakuul's fate before our relationship. But I will admit I made mistakes. Because of me, Vaylin almost got her hands on the Gravestone. If you hadn't stopped her...

I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense. I'm kind of a mess. I still care for you, even though we can never be together again. Too much has happened. But know this--even if I don't agree with all your methods, I want you to beat Vaylin. If anyone can do it, you can.

Even after everything that's happened between us, I still believe in the Alliance. And in you. That might sound strange coming from someone who betrayed you, but it's true. I never lost faith in your cause. I just couldn't stomach some of the things you did.

Maybe I overreacted. I know I made mistakes. At the very least, it was my fault that Vaylin almost got her hands on the Gravestone. Sorry you had to clean up that mess. 

I did what I felt I had to do. Hopefully you see that. Hopefully you understand why I left, even if you don't agree.

With both of you out of the picture, some of my advisors pushed me to make a play for the Eternal Throne. I reminded them-harshly--that the Sith Empire no longer works like that. We now honor our alliances.

As further proof of my enduring loyalty, I've sent you a few small tokens you might find useful. Consider it a &quot;welcome home&quot; gift.

I hope your people will soon send me a full report on your recent whereabouts. If not, I'll have to rely on other sources to piece it together. That's not a threat; just a fact. I assume you're smart enough to realize my agents still keep tabs on your Alliance, just as your people watch me.

I do have one suggestion, though. The next time you and Vaylin disappear somewhere together, leave her there when you return.

We may not be allied, but the Sith Empire still rejoiced over your victory on Zakuul. We watched the HoloNet broadcast as you cut down Arcann, the tyrant who terrorized our people. His death will be celebrated for months to come.

Vaylin must be incensed that you denied her the pleasure of taking Arcann's life. You've killed her entire family, leaving her the last remnant of her once-unassailable bloodline.

Do be careful.</text>

He is nothing more than a ruthless, domineering tyrant. While you slumbered in his carbonite prison, I watched him terrorize my people and nearly destroy the Sith Empire and the Republic. If you think he'll bow to your rule, you are woefully mistaken.

I wish you had ended his life. But if you insist on overseeing his rehabilitation, be wary--and keep one eye open. I have no doubt that he plans to betray you and seize control of your Alliance. If he succeeds, the galaxy won't survive his return to power.

Arcann's actions are on you, Commander.</text>

Royal Decree from Eternal Empress Vaylin

Arcann was a traitor to the Eternal Empire and a disgrace to the good people of Zakuul. His crimes are unforgivable, and his death was deserved. 

He will not be mourned. 

No one is to speak the name of the fallen emperor. Failure to obey will result in swift and severe punishment.</text>

Brother. What am I going to do with you?

First you save Mother from my blade. Then you ruin my party. If that wasn't bad enough, you ran off. With the Outlander. Father would be rolling over in his grave--if he weren't already rattling around inside the Outlander's skull. 

You must know they're toying with you. They consider you nothing more than a sad, broken little runt who was never fit to be emperor. If you were stronger, you'd kill them all and gut the Alliance from the inside. But you're weak and frightened.

Don't worry, Brother. This will all be over soon.

- Vaylin, Eternal Empress of Zakuul 

P.S. Give Mother my love.</text>

Greetings, Commander!

Indo Zal here, alive and well. I'm dictating this message from an Alliance safe house on Zakuul. Not sure where exactly, but the faint odor of goma noodles and flop sweat reminds me of the district where I grew up. Ghastly place.

[Screaming] Not now, you [indecipherable] scum-chugger! I'm talking to someone!

[Clearing voice] Sorry about that, Commander. There are many rebels here, and we're all sharing the same recorder. But I have two more minutes, don't I, you impatient swine?

[Softer] I suppose I can hardly blame them. We've been cooped up here ever since the party-- hiding from Vaylin's death squads, practicing combat drills, and hungrily awaiting your command to rise up and overthrow the Eternal Throne.

The big one's giving me the stink eye, so I'd better end this recording. Farewell, Commander. And long live the Alliance.</text>

Commander! Indo Zal here, dictating a message from the confines of an Alliance med center hidden... somewhere unsavory, judging by the stench. Or is that me? At least the mattress is nice and firm, but the [indecipherable] slop they're serving is enough to make a bogwing wretch. 

Pardon my rambling. The meds are making me a tad loopy.

You've no doubt heard the Zakuulan rebels made a valiant stand against the Alliance's enemies. Unfortunately, we suffered quite a few fatalities in the process. I was lucky to escape with only a few broken bones. Plus a severe concussion. I think. [wheezing laughter]

At any rate, the surviving rebels are a hair upset that you sent them into certain death. But not to worry. I'll talk sense into them. You'll have our support if my name isn't Indo Zal!

Thought she made it up, but now we know at least one is out there. I reached out to that ex-Sith for more info, but it looks like she vanished a few days after the convo we had. I'm sure it's a coincidence. Either way, more for us.

I know Vaylin was damaged. I blame Valkorion for that. I blame myself. I know she left you no other option, and I don't blame you for her death. She had to be stopped. We did the right thing. But she was still my daughter, and it still hurts. 

Sometimes, I remember her as a little girl. She was everything to me back then. But I lost her. And no matter how hard I tried, I never got her back. Yet some part of me still hoped for a miracle. Some part of me hoped she would come back to me as the daughter I once knew.

Now that she's truly gone, I know that will never happen. It's a terrible thing for a mother to face, but I've accepted it. I don't have any choice. We still have work to do. I promise you I will be ready.</text>

You deserve a festival befitting a war hero--but first, there is more work to be done. Though Vaylin is no more, the remnants of her tyrannical empire remain. The Eternal Throne is empty. My rebel friends and the Knights of Zakuul are on the verge of civil war. Even worse, the Eternal Fleet has blockaded Zakuul, and I fear our former protectors may soon unleash their fury on my homeworld. 

Come to Zakuul, and save us from this chaos.

Your humble servant, Indo Zal.

Addendum: 

I pray you get this message. The first time, it failed to send. The Eternal Fleet has opened fire on Zakuul, targeting the Spire and cutting off our communications! I'm re-sending this on an emergency network--I hope it arrives! Please hurry! Only you can save us now!</text>

Things happen in battle. Choices get made. People die. I get that. I'm not blaming anyone. Things like this happen. I just never thought it would happen to Vette.

Not sure how much she told you about our time together, but she was the best business partner I ever had. Quick on her feet. Never panicked. No matter how bad things got, she knew she'd find a way out. And she always did.

There was something about her--an energy, an enthusiasm--that infected everyone she met. I've been running cons so long the game had gotten faded and dull. But when she and I joined forces, it was like everything was bright and shiny again.

And now she's gone. I know she gave her life for a cause she believed in. I believe in the Alliance, too. I guess that makes it better in some way. But it sure feels like the galaxy has gotten a little dimmer now that she's gone.</text>

But my people have a saying: Aliit ori'shya tal'din--family is more than blood. When Torian joined your Alliance, he became part of your Clan. He sacrificed his life for your cause. His glorious death on the battlefield brought honor to himself and to you. 

My people will sing songs of what happened. The defense of Odessen is part of our history now.

I know I thanked you on the battlefield, but it didn't seem like enough. I need to tell you how lucky I am to have you in my life.

I feel bad for Torian--and everyone else who died fighting for the Alliance. I even feel bad for some of Vaylin's people... they can't all be monsters. But I don't like to think about that. I'd rather focus on the future. Our future.

I can't repay what you've done for me. But as long as I'm at your side, I will try. I know as long as we're together, no matter how bad things get, everything will work out in the end.

It's weird, because I feel bad about what happened to Torian. He gave his life for the Alliance. And he wasn't the only one. I guess that's part of war. People die. And I really thought I'd be one of them. But now I have a second chance. Because of you.

I'm not sure exactly why you chose to save me, but I'm in your debt. And I'll do everything I can to pay you back, somehow.

You already had my loyalty, Commander. But now... I don't even know how to explain it. Words aren't really my thing. Just know--you had my back out there. And now I've got yours. Forever.</text>

My people do not fear death, but I was not ready to die when Vaylin's forces surrounded me. Though I would gain honor by falling on the battlefield, I would lose something more important... you.

Some might consider this a weakness. That my feelings for you cloud my thoughts and make me less of a warrior. But that is a lie. Our love makes me stronger. It drives me forward as a better man. A better soldier. A better Mandalorian.

Mandalorians don't fear death, especially not in battle. If I fall fighting our enemies, then I have served my purpose. But don't mistake this for a death wish. I want to live, and you have given me that gift. For that, you have my thanks.

I wish I could offer more than just gratitude. You already had my loyalty, and I'd swear it to you again tenfold if I could. Instead, I promise to honor Vette's noble sacrifice. She was a true hero, and I will try to be the same.

Someday, I may fall in battle. If that day comes, I will embrace my fate knowing I served you with honor. Until then, I am yours to command.

The galaxy recognizes your authority as the supreme leader of the Eternal Alliance. Zakuul's officials are erecting a monument in your honor and offer respect with the personal tribute that accompanies this message.

The Sith Empire and Republic also offer their congratulations, but their niceties are laced with poison. They fear your newfound power--and the might you wield as the master of the Eternal Throne. Their cities still smolder from the last time the Eternal Fleet struck their worlds. According to our intelligence, both factions now conspire to safeguard their people against future attacks--no matter the cost.

Theron and I will keep you updated on the matter.

News spread fast of your new role as peacekeeper and champion of the Eternal Alliance. Vaylin's campaign of destruction carved deep wounds from the Core Worlds to the fringes of Wild Space. The galaxy now looks to you with renewed hope.

Per your orders, we have dispatched several Eternal Fleet ships to the most damaged worlds--starting with Zakuul. Each vessel is loaded with food, supplies, and Alliance volunteers, everything needed to heal their ravaged homelands. Zakuulan officials sent you the attached tribute as a gesture of gratitude.

Despite your generosity, the Sith Empire and Republic remain skeptical. Reports indicate that key leaders fear your ulterior motives and the unchecked power you wield as the master of the Eternal Fleet.

When you saved me on Voss, I was struck by how much you reminded me of Thexan. You both have a gift for inspiring loyalty. It is a shame you two never met.

My people's worlds were being slaughtered before you stopped the Eternal Fleet. For that, you have my gratitude. You've done the galaxy a great favor by removing Vaylin from power. The Eternal Throne is your right. You've earned it.

While this victory belongs to you and your Alliance, I like to think the support of the Sith Empire helped in some way. I hope you will remember who stood by you in the early days. As much as you have accomplished, this is only the beginning: together we can accomplish so much more.

Please let me know the next time you plan an official visit to Dromund Kaas. I guarantee my entire planet will turn out for your victory parade.</text>

I know we have not seen eye-to-eye in the past. I thought you were rash to refuse my offer of allegiance, but obviously you did not need my help to defeat Vaylin and claim the Eternal Throne. Clearly, I underestimated you.

Though you rejected my overtures, I hope you will remember the spirit in which they were made. The Sith Empire does not wish to be your enemy. We have no claim or quarrel with you or your Alliance.

I do not know what your future plans are, but I will ask that you please respect the sovereignty of my people and our worlds. I think you can agree the galaxy is large enough to accommodate both our empires.</text>

At first, I was afraid to believe it was true. But Darth Marr's spirit felt it, too. He confirmed what I'd felt was real, and not some fevered imagining. The master he served for so long--the Sith Emperor that ruled his people for millennia--was no more. This time, he will not return.
