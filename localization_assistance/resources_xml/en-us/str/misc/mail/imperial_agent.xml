We've never met, but I wanted to thank you for your handling of Watcher X on Nar Shaddaa. I know from personal experience how deceptive the man can be; the thought of him running free is mildly terrifying.

You likely aren't aware of the events that led to Watcher X's imprisonment. All I can say is that Operation: Undertow left me with scars that will never heal. I was among the lucky ones.

My people will be performing a detailed postmortem on the body. There's much to learn, and we won't build a mistake like him again.</text>

Personality: Watcher Two is acutely aware of the significance and the limitations of her genetic enhancements--although technically adept, she struggles with rapid environmental changes that leave her unable to integrate new variables. Following her teenage difficulties, she has come to accept her programmed loyalty controls but still suffers in field operations.

Watcher Two's emotional limits are well formed. Should she become romantically engaged with a human colleague, standard support and trust benefits may arise without compromising security. Her priorities are clear.

I've been getting reports from inside the Empire. Word is things are awfully messy with Imperial Intelligence dissolved; no one's keeping order anymore, and that means everyone's trying to grab power.

I understand you've got a reputation but no authority--which puts you in everyone's trigger sights. You want to be a reformer, be careful. Maybe lay low awhile, if that's your style.

On this side of the fence, the new Supreme Chancellor is pushing a more aggressive military strategy. Maybe it'll lead to a quick and easy peace, but it could get very bloody for both sides. I'll do what I can, but I'm in a tricky spot myself.

2) figure out where this war is going.

seriously, it's getting bad. if you really have to fight for them, make sure you know what you're doing. you shouldn't be taking orders from anyone anymore.

3) make doctor lokin stop practicing huttese.

Standard monitoring of Vargai Javis (brother of Serjil, son of Karrels) aboard the hospital ship Anodyne has revealed an item of interest. Vargai was recovering from his injuries in a kolto tank when a mercenary team boarded the hospital vessel. The mercenaries then extracted Vargai and the kolto tank.

Vargai's current location is unknown. Party responsible is also unknown--did our asset on Hutta verify Karrels's execution? Karrels had means and motives to relocate his only surviving son, but I was told he'd been eliminated.</text>

What've you been up to?

Not sure if you'll ever see this, but there are things I never got to say. I should've died on Tatooine. I should hate Imperial Intelligence with all my heart.

I didn't, and I don't, and I don't know how to keep fighting. I'm not giving up, I just... don't know.

Stay alive, okay?</text>

We sent a cleanup team to what's left of the ghost cell village on Tatooine. I wanted to alert you that--along with the expected links to the Eagle's network--we found something strange.

The Old Man spent decades teaching his followers, and it looks like a few outsiders unconnected to terrorism trained under him as well.

The weird part is, some of the data on his students has been wiped. The ghost cell may be gone, but someone's out there with all the Old Man's techniques.</text>

With hundreds of thousands dead--many dissidents and traitors, others unfortunates caught in the war between Lord Jadus and the late Eagle's terrorist network--a time for rebuilding has arrived.

Walking among a crowd of wounded officers and starving slaves, Lord Jadus promised to spread the knowledge of the Sith Order and bring strength to the wretched. His &quot;ambassadors of fire&quot; will lead public ceremonies starting tomorrow for all willing to attend.</text>

we all thought we were special. then most of us died and the Master taught us to see the world like he does.

i don't remember most of what happened after that

when you rescued us, the doctors helped me stop hurting myself and other people. i asked about you, and wanted to say thanks.

Given the recent death of the Eagle and the dismantling of his Eradicator network, Imperial Intelligence will propose that the Citadel stand down from high alert as of 05:00 tomorrow.

It is vital that we show confidence that the dissident problem is contained. The military relies on us to protect it from internal threats. But cleanup operations will take years to complete, and we must remain vigilant.

We have achieved a tremendous victory at great cost. Now we must ensure our enemy does not return and grant our attention to any threats we have neglected.</text>

I'm writing you from a medcenter on Coruscant. They've got me on a lot of painkillers, so sorry if I don't make a lot of sense.

I can't imagine how you feel, working with the SIS. It took a lot of courage for you to come over, and now it must seem like we abused your trust. Ardun's not a bad man, but he thought he needed to play it safe and keep you under control.

Well, maybe he's right and maybe he isn't. Not really my place to argue while I'm on duty, but I'm sure not on duty anymore.

You saved my life, and it dawns on me that you didn't have to. You've got a good heart. The Republic is where you were meant to be.

By now, all of you know that Chance didn't make it back from Taris. He told me once that he was terrified of dying. But he said what scared him worse was dying and no one knowing or caring--dying forgotten, like so many in this business do.

He was a brave soldier, a patriot, an animal-lover and a hilarious drunk. I'll miss him.

I'm sending around his personal effects. Anything left goes to his dad.</text>

Things are working out, though. Not that everyone here wants to take orders from an ex-Jedi, but kill enough idiots and people learn their lesson. I've found a nice little planet where my Nikto can join me. They'll love it here.

Did I mention Darth Serevin offered his protection? I'll be a Sith Lord in no time.

No more rules. I'll help your people so long as me and my cult can do what we want. Maybe I'll even show you my appreciation....</text>

You know how many counselors are on SIS staff? No wonder the Republic is losing the war.

Better to be here than going crazy on Taris, I guess. And I can't face the Jedi after everything. So maybe you were right.

I miss the Nikto so much. You don't know what it's like to have people see you as a hero--someone to love and obey. I'll come back to them. I swear I will.

For now, I'm here. Earning &quot;redemption.&quot; Guess that's how it goes.</text>

To no one's surprise, killing that crazy Jedi caused its own share of problems. The Nikto who worshiped her are blaming the Republic and demanding justice; if we don't produce a scapegoat soon, they'll go on a rampage.

Even if we do, the cult's going to live on, with only Ki Sazen's ramblings to guide them. Maybe we can get them out of the system somehow.</text>

We worked together for only a short time on Hoth, but you earned the respect of myself and my crew and I wanted to share my good news.

As of today, I am retiring from the Imperial military and purchasing the commissions of my most trusted subordinates. I'm eager to spend old age surrounded by luxury.

I'm certain you understand your role in this decision, and I see a bright future ahead of you. Attached is a taste of what you might achieve, following my example.

By the way: It's a pity about the Chiss Defense Force. I hear their base was overrun by pirates and every last man butchered. If only they were more like you.</text>

I am writing in regards to the recent death of Admiral Layek Davos on Hoth. It took me some time to confirm your presence; I still don't know your exact role.

Layek Davos was a brilliant admiral and as corrupt as they come. I will not mourn him. In fact, I have added a commendation to your record for your part in stopping his illegal operation.

But I also warn you: When Imperial Intelligence and the Chiss Defense Force purge corruption from the military without consulting the Moffs, it puts our readiness at risk. Replacing Admiral Davos is not an easy task, and now we must do so on short notice.

Remember that the Empire must act as one.</text>

It's quite a thing to find yourself at once no longer required and yet too vital to cast aside. My days are spent in pursuit of a better dejarik strategy. Better that than to allow languor to become the keeper of my thoughts.

Overheard a curious story about an old adversary resurfacing to play his games with his toys; I sometimes wonder if you were drawn into this particular shroud of deceit and how you might have handled yourself.

I hope you'll forgive the personal nature of this message. The truth is, I've always admired your intelligence.</text>

A figure I will not name wished to see if I had been longing for any particular amenities for my retirement home. The stranger looked around, contemplated, and finally opined that there were nine ways to improve the place. Nothing was asked of me in exchange. I declined the offer, and my would-be benefactor departed.

It was a strange encounter; I should think I would not want a return visit. If you ever find yourself presented with a gift from such a character, you should disintegrate all your possessions and promptly withdraw to parts unknown.

I may not contact you again after this, so I hope that you heed my moderately dark counsel in this matter.</text>

Unease must be creeping up through your insides, but don't worry; I'm not a factor to be concerned with in all this Revanite business. I'm more of a spectator, and you've proven yourself a most intriguing participant--enough so that I thought it might be fun to reach out, say &quot;hi.&quot;

On the subject of communications, I've been following some chatter amongst the traitors in your midst following Darth Arkous's death. They know they can't touch you and they are thoroughly incensed about it. It's really quite amusing.

Regardless, you should remain aware that whatever harm they can't bring to you, they'll surely visit upon your Sith friend once they find her. I wonder how long she can keep to the shadows....

Hey, this was fun after all. I'll have to do it again sometime. 

Seems almost pointless to mention, but I had considered asking you to give the old man my regards. Don't bother; I'm sure if he's alive he knows I'm back in business by now. And that, for me, is satisfaction enough.</text>
