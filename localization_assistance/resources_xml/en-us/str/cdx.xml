		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177814" version="1065353216">Alderaan</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177814" version="1065353216">Alderaan is a mountainous world of lush forests and grasslands, ruled by an assembly of noble houses and an enlightened and advanced citizenry. A founding member of the Republic, Alderaan has been traditionally admired for its wealth, its art and its thinkers, while the deadly intrigues and politics of the nobility have been downplayed.

Recently, those intrigues erupted into civil war, and Alderaan--now officially withdrawn from the Republic--sees conflict it hasn't known in ages. The Republic is backing House Organa's quest for the crown, whereas the Empire backs the former House Thul exiles. Palaces and fields have become pockmarked by cannon fire, and house armies clash on the battlefield.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177818" version="1065353216">Belsavis</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177818" version="1065353216">Officially, Belsavis is a sparsely populated Republic world dominated by arctic plains. Its only notable feature is the rare tropical rifts that break up the expanses of ice, heated by natural geothermal vents and home to a surprising diversity of plant life.

In truth, Belsavis is an ultrasecure prison colony established by the Republic. Until recently, the prison's existence was top secret, but its discovery by the Empire has resulted in rumors spreading throughout the galactic underworld. The prison is now in a state of lockdown, and both Republic and Imperial militaries have a presence on the scene.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177820" version="1065353216">Corellia</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177820" version="1065353216">One of the founding worlds of the Galactic Republic, Corellia nonetheless prides itself on its independence. Some of the finest starships in the galaxy are made on Corellia, along with their daring pilots--men and women looking to explore, to trade or just stay ahead of the law. The cities, like the people, are distinctly Corellian, incorporating the natural landscape into their design despite a heavy manufacturing base.

The Corellian government recently agreed to turn over power to the Sith Empire. This has resulted in riots in the streets and open revolution despite Imperial claims of legitimacy, and the capital of Coronet City has become a battlefield.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177822" version="1065353216">Coruscant</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177822" version="1065353216">The proud capital of the Republic, Coruscant is the largest, the oldest and the most diverse city-world in the galaxy. Kilometer-tall buildings cover virtually all of the planet's surface, with the wealthy and powerful living at the top and the poorest and the most desperate dwelling near the foundations.

Coruscant is only now recovering from the attack by the Empire that led to the eventual cease-fire. Many buildings were reduced to rubble; a few still burn, the fires fueled by chemicals and uncontrolled reactors. During the Empire's attacks, the criminal underworld increased its power base as well, and remains a formidable threat.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177824" version="1065353216">Dromund Kaas</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177824" version="1065353216">Dromund Kaas is the capital of the Sith Empire, founded a millennium ago in the aftermath of the Great Hyperspace War. Since then, the sleek metropolis of Kaas City has grown into a symbol of Imperial power, towering over the surrounding jungle and looming dark against the stormy skies.

The military and the Sith have authority here, under the eye of the Emperor himself. Aside from the wildlife, the greatest threats are internal--slave revolts, feuding Sith Lords and the like. Planetary defenses are formidable, as the Empire still remembers its defeat and exile long ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177826" version="1065353216">Hoth</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177826" version="1065353216">Few life-forms can survive on the ice planet Hoth. Between its subzero surface temperatures, shearing winds and frequent whiteouts, the environment should be considered extremely hostile even to properly outfitted individuals; mechanical equipment and communications technology are prone to freeze and malfunction as well, making any minor setback potentially lethal.

During the war between Republic and Empire, the Hoth system was the site of a major fleet battle. This resulted in a large number of starships falling into Hoth's gravity well and crashing on the planet surface. These derelict ships have become the base of operations for a large group of pirates, as well as a center of dispute between Republic and Imperial forces.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177828" version="1065353216">Ilum</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177828" version="1065353216">The mountainous ice planet Ilum is home to one of the Jedi Order's most distant outposts. Nestled between snow-covered crags is an enclave used by the Jedi for generations, a shelter from the cold and a launching point for journeys into Ilum's exotic crystal caves. These caves produce some of the most rare and powerful lightsaber crystals in the galaxy.

Ilum hosts no indigenous population, although a number of larger animals survive in its environment. Its temperatures fail to reach the extremes of Hoth, but it has never been a target for colonization or occupation.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177830" version="1065353216">Korriban</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177830" version="1065353216">A cruel planet of rocky red deserts and crumbling ruins, Korriban was the homeworld of the ancient Sith. Reclaimed by the Empire in recent decades, it is now the site of the Sith Academy, where the Dark Council oversees the training of new acolytes. Only Sith may come and go freely from the academy, and for a non-Sith to visit Korriban is a great privilege.

Surrounding the academy are the tombs of the first Dark Lords. Used as testing grounds by the academy overseers, the tombs remain filled with traps, monstrosities and relics, even millennia after their construction--along with the bodies of a generation of failed acolytes.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177832" version="1065353216">Ord Mantell</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177832" version="1065353216">A longstanding member of the Galactic Republic, Ord Mantell is a world of deep seas, tall mountains and lush islands. Traders and merchants from across the galaxy ply their wares in Mantellian ports, along with black marketeers and other underworld forces.

In recent years, Ord Mantell has become embroiled in civil war, as anti-government separatists encourage Mantellian independence in the face of a brutally corrupt government with ties to organized crime. The Republic is responding with military force, and the fighting has resulted in high numbers of civilian casualties. Shuttle traffic is currently directed to the island of Avilatan.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177836" version="1065353216">Quesh</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177836" version="1065353216">Once a lush tropical swamp, Quesh's atmosphere became toxic after a series of quakes released dangerous chemicals contained below the planet surface. Most of the native wildlife died off, and Quesh became poisonous to virtually all higher species.

Quesh's toxicity is also its source of value--the chemicals that poisoned the atmosphere are usable in the most powerful adrenals and stimulants. The Republic, with the aid of the Hutt Cartel, has staked a claim to Quesh and is attempting to establish chemical mines. Upon learning of Quesh's existence, the Empire quickly established a presence of its own.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177838" version="1065353216">Tatooine</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177838" version="1065353216">A harsh desert planet off all the major trade routes, Tatooine is known for its heat, its sand, its dangerous wildlife--and little else. Only a few settlements dot Tatooine's endless wastes, inhabited by handfuls of traders and moisture farmers. Tatooine's obscurity has also attracted a small but significant criminal population, here to hide from galactic authorities.

Tatooine lacks any central government or allegiance to Republic or Empire. There are rumors of an Imperial occupation taking place in one of the frontier settlements, but nothing has been confirmed.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177840" version="1065353216">Tython</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177840" version="1065353216">The mysterious Deep Core world of Tython is the birthplace of the Jedi Order. Millennia ago, Tythonian warriors and scholars developed a unique mystic and martial philosophy while studying the Force. Today, their Jedi descendants excavate ancient Tythonian ruins and relearn what was lost.

After the recent destruction of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, the Jedi made their new home on Tython. The mountainous planet remains mostly unexplored, and the violent natives pose a constant threat. The order remains committed to rebuilding here, however, and is now training a new generation of Padawans.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="177844" version="1065353216">Voss</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="177844" version="1065353216">Voss was first discovered only a few years ago, and the rocky, lightly forested planet remains absent from many star charts. Two distinct cultures inhabit the world, both at a pre-spaceflight stage of development.

The first culture, known as the Gormak, is a xenophobic and violent species that dominates most of the planet surface. The second culture, known as the Voss, has been amenable to contact with outsiders and welcomes visitors to the mountain city of Voss-Ka. The Voss have a highly ritualistic society and are notable for their unusual aptitude with the Force. The Republic and the Empire have sent representatives to Voss-Ka to explore the possibility of an alliance.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="200997" version="1065353216">Nar Shaddaa</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="200997" version="1065353216">The so-called &quot;smuggler's moon&quot; is best known for one thing: anything can be bought here if the price is right. Nar Shaddaa orbits Hutta, homeworld of the Hutt Cartel, but exists as a power in its own right. Criminal organizations and legitimate enterprises operate side-by-side, regulated only by the Hutts' whims. Gleaming skyscrapers house corporations, casinos, technology shops, spice houses and every other type of business imaginable.

Although no other world offers Nar Shaddaa's unique services, the city has a notorious murder and disappearance rate. Gangsters, pirates, slavers and worse crowd the streets, and Republic and Imperial representatives compete for influence with the local powers. Strangers should be extremely cautious.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201069" version="1065353216">Hutta</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201069" version="1065353216">Adopted homeworld of the notorious Hutt Cartel, Hutta is a planet of semi-toxic swampland broken up by industrial facilities and urban centers. Hutt-aligned gangs control the civilized regions, forever warring over territory and resources. In the swamps, the native Evocii struggle against their Hutt rulers with limited success.

The Hutts are officially neutral in the conflict between Empire and Republic, and welcome visitors. Pirates, slavers and spice dealers are all common sights in Hutt palaces, while corporations often establish themselves on Hutta's moon, Nar Shaddaa. Newly arriving shuttles on Hutta are directed to the town of Jiguuna.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201073" version="1065353216">Balmorra</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201073" version="1065353216">Once an independent corporate and manufacturing world, Balmorra was defended by the Republic and conquered by the Empire during the war. Now the corporations have mostly fled, local collaborators have been rewarded with positions in the Imperial puppet government, and an entrenched and well-armed resistance opposes the Empire's rule.

Despite brutal retaliation by the Imperial military against military and civilian targets, the battle to eliminate the resistance drags on. Droid factories and industrial waste sites have become battlegrounds. The main Balmorran spaceport is in the city of Sobrik, an Imperial military stronghold heavily fortified against resistance attacks.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201075" version="1065353216">Balmorra</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201075" version="1065353216">Once an independent corporate and manufacturing world, Balmorra was defended by the Republic and conquered by the Empire during the war. Now the corporations have mostly fled, local collaborators have been rewarded with positions in the Empire's puppet government, and an entrenched resistance opposes Imperial rule.

After a prolonged absence, the Republic has returned to Balmorra to aid the resistance movement. Droid factories and industrial waste sites have become battlegrounds, and the Imperial military is responding with a buildup of its own.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201080" version="1065353216">Taris</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201080" version="1065353216">Taris was once a city-world like Coruscant. Three centuries ago, however, it was bombarded by the Sith Lord Darth Malak and left a toxic ruin. The years since have not been kind to Taris, as vegetation and animal life struggle to gain a foothold in the shattered skeleton of a planetary metropolis.

The Republic began to recolonize Taris less than a decade ago, and has suffered innumerable setbacks--everything from pirate attacks to the strange &quot;rakghoul plague&quot;. Nonetheless, the reconstruction effort continues, its proponents determined to prove that the Empire can never truly destroy greatness.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201082" version="1065353216">Taris</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201082" version="1065353216">Taris was once a city-world, home to a planetary metropolis. Three centuries ago, however, it was bombarded by the great Darth Malak and left a toxic ruin. The years since have not been kind to Taris, as vegetation and animal life struggle to gain a foothold in shattered skyscrapers and habitats.

The Republic began to recolonize Taris less than a decade ago, aiming to make it into a symbol of Republic hope and steadfastness. In response, the Empire is mobilizing troops and beginning a full-scale assault. Early reports speak of fierce resistance from the Republic, as well as natural hazards in the form of wildlife and the mysterious &quot;rakghoul plague.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201096" version="1065353216">Chevin</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201096" version="1065353216">Natives of the planet Vinsoth, the Chevin are long-snouted, stubby-legged aliens known for their quick intelligence and underworld dealings. The most famous Chevin gangster was the slave Adamar Kirb, who managed to establish his own cartel on the Hutt-dominated world of Nar Shaddaa. While his cartel eventually broke apart into many smaller gangs, his influence is still felt. 

Because of their business savvy, underworld connections and starship expertise, the Empire considers the Chevin a useful, if weak, potential ally in the ongoing galactic conflict with the Republic, though as with most aliens, most of the Chevin within the Empire are slaves.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201119" version="1065353216">Kaas City</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201119" version="1065353216">The capital city of the Imperial homeworld of Dromund Kaas is one part massive skyscrapers and one part impenetrable fortress. It is host to the Citadel, where the Sith of the Dark Council (and those who aspire to the Dark Council) lord over their followers, and the headquarters of the Imperial military and Imperial Intelligence.

Kaas City was founded by the first Sith to arrive on Dromund Kaas, who saw the gorges and ravines of the jungle world as the perfect place to build their eternal sanctuary. Over the following centuries, its population grew into the millions--proud Imperials working toward the glory of the Sith and slaves submitting to Imperial will. Kaas City is also where the Emperor is believed to make his home, keeping a watchful eye on his Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201321" version="1065353216">Duros</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201321" version="1065353216">Duros are among the most common and well-traveled aliens in the galaxy. One of the founding species of the Galactic Republic, they are known for their role in mapping the earliest hyperspace routes and pioneering hyperdrive technology; to this day, the Duros diaspora is rich and varied, and modern Duros are as frequently soldiers as they are mechanics or moisture farmers. The Duros homeworld, Duro, is located on the Corellian Trade Spine, at the nexus of two vital trade lanes.

Famous Duros include the smuggler Sol Vara, who outraced Exar Kun's forces during the Great Sith War to bring food to the refugees of Aduba Six. Not all Duros are wildly successful, however; on Nar Shaddaa, many Duros live in poverty under the rule of the Hutt Cartel, and on Dromund Kaas and other Imperial worlds, Duros are often used as slaves.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201331" version="1065353216">Selkath</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201331" version="1065353216">Selkath are a sleek, amphibious species native to the oceans of the planet Manaan. Diplomatic and family-oriented, they have traditionally been advocates of peace in the galaxy, taking a decidedly neutral political stance. Their homeworld is a major exporter (and formerly the sole source) of the medicinal fluid kolto, and it is the kolto trade that made the Selkath an influential force in the past.

However, when the Empire first returned to the galaxy and launched its attacks on Republic worlds, Manaan was one of the first worlds to be devastated. A massive bombing destroyed most of the planet's surface infrastructure, driving the Selkath to their underwater cities. Since then, the Selkath have mostly been cut off from the larger galaxy; those who were offworld when Manaan was attacked have largely been stranded, and only a few Selkath--mainly ambassadors seeking aid for their devastated planet--have left Manaan since.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201338" version="1065353216">The Dark Temple</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201338" version="1065353216">Hundreds of years ago, the Sith Emperor ordered the construction of the Dark Temple as a burial place for his dead and defeated enemies, &quot;to aid them in becoming one with the Force.&quot; Little is known of what rituals the Emperor performed there, but the Dark Temple has become a nexus of powerful dark side energy, and a place where ancient weapons and ancient secrets of the Sith lay sealed away in cavernous chambers.

Although the Dark Temple grounds have always been a dangerous place for the weak-willed (the expansion of the Kaas City power grid into tunnels beneath the temple drove a thousand slaves mad), the temple itself remained sealed until recently, when an expedition of power-hungry Sith Lords and their servants breached the gateway.

The Dark Council did not sanction this intrusion, nor did it punish the rogue Sith; no one returned from the expedition to punish. Violent electrical storms surrounded the temple for the first week after it was opened, and since then, additional expeditions have been sent by the council to determine the temple's status. Their reports have not been made public.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201353" version="1065353216">Grathan Estate</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201353" version="1065353216">The estate of the rogue Sith Lord Grathan is a miniature fortress, reinforced by cutting-edge weapons technology and experimental shielding. Lord Grathan's cadre of scientists are constantly upgrading the defenses to ensure that air strikes fail to do harm--only ground-based attacks can do real damage. It's the perfect place for a rogue Sith Lord to make his stand.

Lord Grathan has been reinforcing his territory and adding sublevels to his manor for years, suggesting that his plan to declare himself the thirteenth Dark Council member has been in progress longer than many assume. Any number of traps and treasures may exist deep underground, guarded by Grathan's personal guards and automated war droids.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="201368" version="1065353216">The Unfinished Colossus</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="201368" version="1065353216">A massive, unfinished statue towering over the jungles of Dromund Kaas, the colossus was the project of Dark Council member Darth Vowrawn's ambitious apprentice, Lord Qet. In a bid to advance in prestige within the Sith Order, Lord Qet commissioned the construction of the colossus--a statue of his master--in secret, bringing in offworld slaves to do the work. The slaves rebelled, and now the colossus stands unfinished while the slaves search for a way to destroy it and win their freedom through force. Lord Qet has been trying to end the rebellion and finish the colossus, but other Sith Lords have seen the chaos as an opportunity to advance their own reputations in the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202348" version="1065353216">Tomb of Ajunta Pall</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202348" version="1065353216">Before the Empire, before the Sith Order, Ajunta Pall was the very first Dark Lord. Once a Jedi Master, Ajunta Pall learned how to create and shape life itself through the Force--an art the Jedi feared and sought to end. In an act of defiance, he turned his newfound power against the Jedi Order and rebelled.

In the end, the Jedi banished Ajunta Pall and his followers, exiling them to the Outer Rim--where the exiles found Korriban and a Force-wielding native species called the Sith. Ajunta Pall impressed the Sith with his power and technology, and the Sith soon revered the exiles as gods. From his seat of power on Korriban, Ajunta Pall was named Dark Lord of the Sith and founded the Sith Empire. 

Upon his death, Ajunta Pall's body was entombed in the Valley of the Dark Lords. After millennia of sandstorms, cave-ins and warfare, the tomb still stands as a testament to his lasting influence.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202350" version="1065353216">Valley of the Dark Lords</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202350" version="1065353216">Since the dawn of the Empire, the Valley of the Dark Lords has been the final resting place for the galaxy's most legendary Sith. Carved into the rock walls and anointed with the blood of a thousand slaves, the valley's tombs are monuments to the influence and strength of their interred lords. A tomb's construction can require decades, construction beginning long before death claims its eventual occupant and ending long after.

With the defeat of the Sith Empire in the Great Hyperspace War, Korriban was abandoned with only ancient statues to guard over the valley. Grave robbers and cave-ins wore down the tombs for a thousand years until the Sith returned and restored Korriban to its former glory. Excavations into the rediscovered tombs are now underway, and already Sith wonder who will be the next great warrior to lie among the legends in the Valley of the Dark Lords.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202351" version="1065353216">The Wilds</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202351" version="1065353216">Nowhere on Korriban is the planet's dark influence stronger than in the lower wilds. What begins as ringing ears and a cold unease can eventually cripple and dominate an unprepared Sith; weaker minds can be twisted and broken in a matter of hours, leaving soldiers weeping in the sand or slaves frothing, ready to kill.

The source of this corrupting power is unknown. Some believe it is the residual dark energy of the ancient Sith species, while others insist the canyon serves as a focal point for the combined hatred and strength of the entombed Dark Lords. Some even hope the madness is caused by an artifact buried beneath the sands, waiting for a Sith to claim its power</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202352" version="1065353216">Sith Academy</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202352" version="1065353216">Rising above the Valley of the Dark Lords, the Sith Academy is a monument to the power of the dark side and the might of the Sith Empire. Would-be students throughout Imperial space compete for the privilege of studying within the Academy halls, but only those strong in the Force are selected--and most of those perish in the struggle to become Sith.

Beyond the training rooms lay many secrets that remain hidden to all but the most powerful Sith Lords. Higher levels contain chambers for members of the Dark Council, where few living creatures are permitted. Whispered rumors suggest that the Emperor himself has a sanctum within the Academy, but no one has seen the Emperor on Korriban for many years.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202353" version="1065353216">Tomb of Tulak Hord</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202353" version="1065353216">Lord of Hate, Master of the Gathering Darkness and Dark Lord of the Sith. These are but a few of the titles worn by the great Tulak Hord. His command of the dark side and mastery of lightsaber techniques won Hord many battles, and each victory earned him enemies abroad and within the Sith ranks. Of the many who challenged his might, none were successful.

Among Hord's greatest triumphs were the battles of Yn and Chabosh. With an army of dark side warriors and his faithful Dashade assassin at his side, he annihilated the rebels who defied the expansion of the Sith Empire and went on to conquer the Dromund system--setting the stage for Dromund Kaas to eventually become capital of the Empire. Imperial historians believe the worlds conquered by Hord number in the hundreds, but any records from his bygone era were lost in the Great Hyperspace War.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202354" version="1065353216">Tomb of Naga Sadow</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202354" version="1065353216">Naga Sadow was ruled by ambition: ambition for power, for dominance and for the expansion of the Sith Empire. Marka Ragnos's body was still warm when Naga Sadow clashed with Sith Lord Ludo Kressh over their late ruler's title. The spirit of Marka Ragnos interrupted their duel and told the two Sith Lords of a greater enemy: the Republic and its Jedi defenders. Naga Sadow saw opportunity in this revelation and launched an attack on Republic space, a move that would see Sadow named the Empire's ruler and spark the Great Hyperspace War.

Naga Sadow's ambition and overconfidence soon became his greatest weaknesses. Even with his mastery of Force illusions, the Republic outmatched the Sith. Sadow's invasion failed, and the Republic fleet pursued him back to Sith space. He fled Korriban with his warriors as the Sith Empire crumbled around him.

Sadow sought refuge on the remote moon Yavin Four, where he died after spending years trying to rebuild the Empire he had inadvertently helped to destroy. Naga Sadow's spirit, however, survived to pass on Sith teachings, planting the seed of corruption among his Jedi enemies.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202355" version="1065353216">Tomb of Marka Ragnos</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202355" version="1065353216">Strength, power and strategy marked the rule of Marka Ragnos. Descended from the original Sith inhabitants of Korriban and the Dark Jedi exiles who interbred with them, Marka Ragnos was destined for greatness. He conquered his competitors in a series of quick, ruthless campaigns and became Dark Lord of all Sith, a title he would hold for more than a century.

The reign of Marka Ragnos might have been short-lived had he not displayed great strategic discipline. Instead of clashing directly with Sith challengers who hungered for his power, he pitted his enemies against each other to weaken and destroy them. Similarly, he was one of few Sith of his era who knew of the existence of the Republic and the Jedi Order. He chose not to attack, and instead focused on strengthening the Sith Empire.

The golden age of the Sith would end shortly after his death, but the legacy and spirit of Marka Ragnos would live on within his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202363" version="1065353216">The Rust Yards, according to common wisdom, are where old industrial facilities go to die. Over the decades, many factories have been constructed, operated and run into the ground here--only to be rebuilt and repurposed. Ore refineries become droid recycling plants when the ore supply runs dry; weapons assembly lines become toxic chemical storage bays when the arms dealing business is slow.

Nem'ro the Hutt has traditionally controlled the businesses in the Rust Yards--never by official contract, but by virtue of having the largest armed force in the area and by coaxing plant foremen into cooperating. Recent brutal attacks have shifted control of the Rust Yards to Nem'ro's rival, Fa'athra, who keeps the area locked down with his own mercenaries and security droids. The local workforce has little choice but to cooperate.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202364" version="1065353216">Fa'athra's Palace</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202364" version="1065353216">Like the palace of Nem'ro, Fa'athra's palace is modeled after the capitol building in the Hutta city of Bilbousa. Unlike the palace of Nem'ro, Fa'athra's home is a veritable deathtrap--built with warfare and defense as its primary purpose, rather than business and luxury.

Fa'athra employs several different mercenary groups to patrol the palace grounds and corridors. Each mercenary organization is given information only about its own territory and has no information about the rest of the palace's defenses. Fa'athra's paranoia guarantees that no single betrayal can cause his downfall, but it may also be his greatest weakness.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202365" version="1065353216">Nem'ro's Palace</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202365" version="1065353216">The palace of Nem'ro the Hutt is half-fortress, half-monument-to-hedonism. Anyone who does business in Jiguuna is expected to come to the palace and pay his or her dues, but Nem'ro himself stays hidden behind multiple layers of security; most visitors are lucky to speak to one of his lieutenants.

Still, a visit to the palace has its privileges. In addition to the fully stocked cantina and the right to socialize with traveling traders, pirates and businesspeople from across the galaxy, the pleasures of the fighting pit and the private suites await those of a particular temperament.

Murder and theft aren't unknown in the palace, either--but acts performed without Nem'ro's blessing can have gruesome repercussions.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202366" version="1065353216">Jiguuna</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202366" version="1065353216">Hutts are notoriously territorial creatures, and their settlements reflect this. Enormous urban centers inhabited by thousands of Hutts are few on Hutta; instead, the planet's industrial towns are scattered across the globe, ruled like city-states by whichever Hutt rises to the top.

Jiguuna is one such industrial town, serving as an operational hub for nearby factories, mines and processing centers. Booming and influential two centuries ago, Jiguuna fell into anarchy when its founder, Bakuush the Hutt, died in a mechanical accident. Afterward, Jiguuna's population of humanoid enforcers, workers and slaves fought for scraps under a succession of would-be ganglords.

Eventually, a Hutt called Nem'ro eliminated his competitors and declared himself Jiguuna's new ruler. Since then, Jiguuna has been on an upswing, facilitating the distribution of shvash gas, spice and weapons. Competition with neighboring Hutts has brought gang warfare back to town, but business goes on, and Nem'ro controls the locals with bribes and brute force.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202371" version="1065353216">The Gnarls</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202371" version="1065353216">&quot;The Gnarls&quot; is a name given to the wilds near the outpost and landing pads beneath the Masters' Retreat. It was nicknamed for the thick undergrowth that originally covered the region, which took several months to clear. The original explorers of Tython discovered and restored ruined stone paths and bridges leading through the Gnarls, suggesting these wilds were once used by the ancient Jedi.

Although still a proving ground for Jedi Padawans, in recent years the Gnarls has become increasingly dangerous. Wild animals have begun migrating closer to the Gnarls outpost, and there have been sightings of Tython's native Flesh Raiders in neighboring sectors. The Jedi Council is in discussions about moving the training grounds to a safer region, but many Masters feel that risk is necessary at a certain level of tutelage; the galaxy is dangerous, and Jedi can't be shielded forever if they're to be prepared.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202372" version="1065353216">Jedi Temple</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202372" version="1065353216">Since the destruction of the original temple during the Sacking of Coruscant, the Jedi Temple on Tython has become the spiritual home and sanctuary of the Jedi Order. Housing meditation rooms, lecture theaters and the Jedi Archives, the temple's architecture was deliberately changed from the original on Coruscant, in line with the Jedi philosophy of non-attachment. The new design is intended to echo the style of Alderaan's famous castles and to evoke the Jedi virtues of humility, serenity and patience.

Construction began a year after the Jedi made a permanent settlement on Tython and took three years to complete using local Tythonian stone and timber. The temple's site, built upon the ruins of a much older temple, was chosen by the Jedi Council after a week of fasting and meditation. While the temple's formidable technological defenses are concealed and integrated into the architecture, it's the presence of the Council and the Jedi who train there who truly ensure its safety from invaders.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202374" version="1065353216">Mannett Point</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202374" version="1065353216">Mannett Point was originally founded by Ord Mantellian pirates as an underground vault for their ill-gotten gains. As their criminal haven became respectable, the pirates were eventually replaced by &quot;businessmen&quot; who converted the subterranean warehouses into a freight shipping center. Goods that landed at Fort Garnik were sorted at Mannett Point and then distributed across Ord Mantell.

After the establishment of Fort Garnik, the Republic military continued using Mannett Point to store munitions and war materiel. This would prove to be a fatal mistake. Separatists staged a daring midnight raid that destroyed the bridge between Mannett Point and Fort Garnik, cutting off reinforcements.

Separatist commandos swarmed Mannett Point under cover of darkness, using the chaos from the bridge's destruction to infiltrate the warehouses. The separatists quickly slaughtered the Republic defenders to a man. By dawn, Mannett Point was a separatist stronghold--giving the Republic's enemy a major storehouse of weapons and supplies to continue besieging Fort Garnik.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202376" version="1065353216">Savrip Island</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202376" version="1065353216">The thin sliver of beach colloquially referred to as &quot;Savrip Island&quot; derives its name from the hulking brutish creatures infesting it. For whatever reason, the savrips inhabiting the islet rarely stray from its borders--but on the other hand, they do not appreciate uninvited guests. Beachcombers have disappeared in this deadly region for decades.

Local legends tell of a clever crime lord named &quot;Frang the Toothless&quot; who negotiated a deal with the savrips. In return for Frang being allowed to dump his enemies on Savrip Island, the gangster promised to provide the natives with a steady food supply. It is said both sides benefited tremendously from this arrangement.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202392" version="1065353216">The Works</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202392" version="1065353216">Impressive as Coruscant's shining towers are, they could not exist without the less-glamorous Works, the heavy industrial complex deep below in the lower levels. The Works is home to Coruscant's hydrosupply stations, pollution-processing plants and electrical generators, staffed by droids who can survive accidents in the Works' dangerous machinery. 

Some of Coruscant's more desperate homeless hide in the Works, tapping the pipes for water and sleeping under the power conduits to keep warm. Occasionally they will break a major pipeline, causing blackouts and water shortages on the levels above. One Senator, while demanding harsher penalties for vagrancy, found his water supply mysteriously cut off forty times in a month.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202395" version="1065353216">Senate Tower</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202395" version="1065353216">No visitor to Coruscant can fail to be awed by the majestic Senate tower. Built to house the thousands-strong Galactic Senate, it is also home to the offices of the Supreme Chancellor, numerous embassies and the headquarters of Republic Special Forces.

The interior of the Senate tower is open to the public, though Coruscant Security and the Republic military patrol the corridors. While it survived the Sacking of Coruscant, the Senate tower was later damaged when a number of Senators, supporters of the Treaty of Coruscant, were targeted by a bomb.

Entrance to the Senate tower is via the Avenue of the Core Founders, a famous concourse flanked by the statues of the Core Founders themselves. Inside, visitors to the Senate tower are encouraged to enjoy the guided tours or peruse the holographic statues of famous Senators.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202828" version="1065353216">Acklay</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202828" version="1065353216">Acklay are native to the planet Vendaxa, whose ultra-dense ecosystem lends itself to evolutionary specialization. There, acklay are among the top predators, able to stalk and eviscerate prey among the jungles and plains, tracking creatures by their electrical auras. An acklay is not built to build nests or forage or migrate when seasons change--an acklay only knows how to hunt, and survive the hunting.

Despite various governments' efforts to prevent the spread of acklay, the creatures are traded on the black market as gladiatorial challenges and targets for big game hunters. Inevitably, a few acklay escape or are left out in the wild, and the creatures either die--or they breed, survive and threaten anyone they encounter.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202830" version="1065353216">Akk Dog</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202830" version="1065353216">Loyal guard dogs, faithful pets and savage killers: with the right training, akk dogs can fill any of these roles. Those brave enough to challenge the beasts must contend with a thick, scaly carapace that deflects the most powerful of blows and jaws strong enough to crush durasteel. Although native to Haruun Kal, akk dogs have been exported across the galaxy to serve a variety of masters. When not domesticated, akk dogs live in the wild, hunting in packs and attacking anyone foolish enough to enter their territory.

In addition to their incredible strength, akk dogs are rumored to be Force sensitive. In recent years a Jedi named Master Sulan attempted to connect with the creatures through Force-bonding exercises. The Jedi's endeavor was cut short when his Padawan's life was claimed by a particularly hungry akk dog pack leader.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202832" version="1065353216">Asharl Panther</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202832" version="1065353216">These fierce, attractively spotted cats are found on numerous worlds in the Outer Rim and Unknown Regions. The distinctive dorsal fronds of the asharl panther work as a set of extra sensory organs; thick nerve bundles running up the fronds allow the asharl panther to pick up the vibrations of threats approaching from behind. Along with the panthers' pelts, these fronds are often sought after by hunters.
	
The asharl panther has been adopted as a mascot of the Mandalorian Rodarch clan, whose members train the animals to fight alongside them and who paint their armor to match the panthers' pelts. The symbolism of a beast which is fearless and always aware of its surroundings is one the Rodarch clan has embraced wholeheartedly.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202834" version="1065353216">Bantha</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202834" version="1065353216">Domestication of the bantha has become vital to survival on Tatooine and other colonized worlds. Intelligent and reliable creatures, they can be trained as pack animals, passenger carriers and even war mounts. When needed, banthas also serve as a source of sustenance. Their meat and milk are edible, and a single bantha can provide weeks' worth of food. Bantha skin and fur can be made into leather and clothing, and their horns are often carved into tools or jewelry.

A lumbering Houk bounty hunter reluctantly gained the nickname &quot;Bantha&quot; Boskirn after performing several jobs on Tatooine. Boskirn's career was cut short when he angrily pulled his blaster on a smuggler who mocked him for the name; Boskirn was unfortunately too slow on the draw.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202836" version="1065353216">Baspoor Glider</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202836" version="1065353216">The baspoor glider, sometimes called the &quot;sky swimmer&quot; for its fishlike appearance, is an omnivorous flying amphibian often found on temperate worlds. Its unique physiology allows it to &quot;land&quot; in water, where it can continue to propel itself with its powerful wings. It has very little mobility on solid surfaces, and has difficulty taking flight again should it find itself grounded.

The young of the baspoor glider are carried on its mother's back for the first few months of life and have a highly unusual diet. Children gnaw at the skin of the mother for nourishment while the mother focuses on her own needs--her trivial injuries healing quickly each day.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202838" version="1065353216">Bogstalker</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202838" version="1065353216">The bogstalker is one of many ancient species from the planet Taris's prehistory thought extinct until its rediscovery after the planet's bombardment. It turned out that the bogstalkers had survived for millennia beneath Taris's sprawling undercity, and in the post-bombardment wreckage, the bogstalker has thrived as its natural swampy habitat has spread.

Remarkably, the pollutants from the destruction of Taris have only made the bogstalker more resilient, as its flesh is now poisonous to most predators--even the voracious rakghouls.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202840" version="1065353216">Bogwing</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202840" version="1065353216">Bogwings are dangerous reptavian carnivores who often live near lakes or marshes. When they hunt, they skim the ground or marsh at high speed, using their long jaws to snatch up prey or strain the water for fish. Larger creatures are grasped in the bogwing's heavy front claws, which are surprisingly powerful for its size. Observations show that if a bogwing is hungry enough, it can tackle animals several times its own weight. 

Because of this trait, during the Great War the Republic military briefly considered training bogwings to carry supplies or even munitions to squads in remote areas. However, bogwings are extremely temperamental and respond badly to being handled. The risk to potential trainers was judged to be too high, and the idea was never widely implemented.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202842" version="1065353216">Bolraida</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202842" version="1065353216">Utterly at odds with the tranquility of their native Alderaan, bolraidas are one of the most aggressive species in the galaxy. They are brutally effective hunters, running down prey with their powerful front legs before gouging them with the hook-like tusks on their lower jaws.

Early Alderaanian settlers were shocked to encounter such violent beasts on their paradisiacal new home, and it wasn't long before bolraida attacks became a leading cause of death. Unlike their distant relative, the iraida, bolraidas are impossible to train; nearly every attempt to domesticate the beasts has ended disastrously.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202844" version="1065353216">Bormu</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202844" version="1065353216">The enormous and majestic bormus once moved in herds across Balmorra--until the Imperial bombardment wiped out many of the slow-moving behemoths and the pollution from Balmorra's destroyed factories poisoned the land and the bormus' food supply. 

Despite their size, bormus are incredibly gentle beasts and formerly relied on their herds for protection, stampeding potential predators. Now that they are on the brink of extinction, lone bormus are easily picked off by smaller, faster predators.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202846" version="1065353216">Chemilizard</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202846" version="1065353216">Most creatures avoid Hutta's polluted swamps, but these massive reptiles call the toxic marshes home. Nicknamed &quot;chemilizards&quot; by the local workers, these predators have adapted to the poisonous land by absorbing toxins, which contribute to their unique coloring and acidic saliva. Many also believe these toxins have poisoned the chemilizards' minds, turning the ferocious reptiles violent and untamable.

Before their mutation, chemilizards were a Hutt delicacy known as orpali dragons. These rare lizards were bred for harvest, killed in infancy and traditionally served over a bed of glazed chuba eyes. Orpali dragons were on the menu for the centennial feast of Bakuush the Hutt when several hatchlings escaped into the wild through the palace sewers. Over time, the resilient lizards evolved, and although one Hutt did attempt to dine on the adapted chemilizards, the results were most unappetizing.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202848" version="1065353216">Mutated Colicoid</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202848" version="1065353216">The product of secretive experiments conducted on Balmorra prior to the Imperial invasion, the mutated Colicoids are mindless, bloodthirsty insectoids with many legs and sharp claws. Originally created in the lab facility known colloquially as Bugtown, these monstrosities escaped during the Empire's conquest and have overrun parts of Balmorra (including the lab facilities where they were created).

The creatures seem particularly drawn to Balmorra's hazard vaults and other zones of heavy pollution. By feeding on the toxic waste, they appear to grow stronger and more vicious.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202850" version="1065353216">Cthon</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202850" version="1065353216">Cthons are vicious humanoids that have plagued the underworld of Coruscant for centuries, though some have found their way or been smuggled offworld. Swift to mutate from generation to generation, nearly blind despite their unusual eye structure, cthons find their prey by listening for movement and feeling vibrations through Coruscant's substructures. Many of the lower level's more superstitious believe the cthons were originally Coruscanti criminals, banished from the upper levels and left to devolve. There is no scientific evidence for this belief.

While they usually scavenge from the huge piles of garbage that accumulate in Coruscant's lower levels, cthons are vicious hunters, capable of bringing down security patrols. Coruscant's reconstruction has been particularly beneficial to the cthon population, providing new lairs and breeding grounds, not to mention a surfeit of lost and easily preyed-upon refugees.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202852" version="1065353216">Dewback</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202852" version="1065353216">Dewbacks are omnivorous reptiles that originated on Tatooine, where settlements, moisture farmers and Sand People alike use them as work beasts and transportation, and where wild dewbacks still roam the planet's deserts and canyons. Over time, the sturdy creatures have been exported to other worlds and found similar utilitarian niches elsewhere.

Centuries ago, Czerka Corporation scientists attempted to breed &quot;war dewbacks&quot; that were larger and more aggressive than their easily domesticated cousins. Although the scientists eventually succeeded, the project was written off as a failure when the test herd broke out of its enclosure and rampaged through the research facility.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202854" version="1065353216">Iraida</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202854" version="1065353216">Iraidas are a species of predatory reptomammals native to Alderaan, known for their exceptional hearing and extreme resistance to cold. Although they are distantly related to the bolraida, iraidas have demonstrated a level of intelligence far superior to their vicious brethren; this has not only made them more cunning predators but has also led to their limited use as trained watch-beasts and gladiatorial challenges.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202856" version="1065353216">Icetromper</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202856" version="1065353216">On a world as inhospitable as Hoth, herbivores need natural advantages to survive. The lumbering herd beasts commonly called &quot;icetrompers&quot; must contend with the constant threat of hungry wampas and whitefangs. Unable to outrun their natural predators, icetrompers compensate with powerful stomping hooves and thick curled horns that can sweep aside even the most determined hunter.

An icetromper's greatest natural asset, however, is its multiple sets of eyes. Like certain arachnid species, the secondary eyes are reserved exclusively for detection of sudden changes in nearby light patterns. Even the stealthiest wampas have difficulty sneaking up on icetrompers.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202858" version="1065353216">Scyk</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202858" version="1065353216">The bloodthirsty scyks inhabit remote regions of Tatooine, thankfully far from most settled areas. They seem almost to delight in carnage, brutally tearing through prey and unwary desert travelers. Their fangs are a prized trophy among hunters, who rarely escape the creatures without scars.

The Sith beastmaster Lord Adrazar found the scyk a deadly and eager servant. However, no amount of training or Force manipulation could persuade the creatures to cooperate in packs for more than a few days. The scyk that survived--obviously the strongest--now guards his personal domicile on Dromund Kaas.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202860" version="1065353216">Horranth</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202860" version="1065353216">Four-legged reptilian predators found primarily on Tython, horranths typically hunt in large family groups called broods. With their high birth rate, quick maturation and few natural predators, the horranth population is usually constrained only by a limited food supply.

If food suddenly becomes more abundant in a region, a horranth matriarch will lay hundreds of eggs, causing her brood's population to explode. As their numbers multiply, the beasts grow bolder and more aggressive. Unchecked, the brood will continue to spread until they finally exceed their food supply, at which point the matriarch will suddenly stop producing eggs. Unfortunately, this return to normal population levels typically only happens after the brood has thoroughly devastated the region.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202862" version="1065353216">Harvorisk</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202862" version="1065353216">The second of two species discovered by Jarn Harvus on Nim Drovis, the harvorisk is actually no relation to the similarly named harvap. Shortly after its discovery, the harvorisk was coveted by Hutts across the galaxy, who considered it alternately an exotic new pet and a tasty meal. But its rapid rate of breeding and vicious, untrainable personality quickly led to the Hutts' becoming disenchanted with their new pets, causing the release of many harvorisks into the wild.

On Quesh, it was the Three Families who brought harvorisks to the planet and genetically modified the creatures so they might survive in the toxic atmosphere--albeit at a cost of half their lifespan. The Hutts refuse to accept responsibility for the creatures' escape, but the harvorisks have begun reproducing, seeking prey among the planet's miners.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202864" version="1065353216">Harvap</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202864" version="1065353216">One of two new species discovered by Jarn Harvus on Nim Drovis, the harvap can be found on several planets and has thrived on heavily industrialized worlds in particular. Originally a carrion-eater, the harvap has adapted to other ecosystems by feeding on industrial waste and garbage in addition to its normal diet.

Harvap infestations have plagued Hutt Space due to the density of industry and the generally lax decontamination procedures used when moving cargo from world to world. On Quesh, the byproducts of venom mining and processing have created a particularly strong breed of harvap that can thrive in the toxic atmosphere.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202866" version="1065353216">Gundark</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202866" version="1065353216">The gundark is among the most feared of all species. Its strength is matched only by its resilience and keen senses, and it is a favorite target of big game hunters and a featured attraction in gladiatorial arenas galaxy-wide. Gundarks rarely last long in captivity, however; many beast tamers tell of letting their guard down for a half-second in the presence of these mighty creatures, only to be attacked and horribly mauled. They are the lucky ones. Anyone encountering a gundark in the wild knows to give this monster a wide berth or else be prepared for a fight; the gundark is known to attack unprovoked.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202868" version="1065353216">Guid</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202868" version="1065353216">Guids are hoofed quadrupeds indigenous to Tython. Notable for their muscular forelegs and the distinctive tufts of hair on the shoulders, back and chin, they are typically encountered grazing alone or in small herds. Guids are not particularly aggressive, but if threatened, they are capable of causing injury or even death with their massive forelegs and powerful jaws. Attempts to domesticate guids have proved unsuccessful due to their stubborn and occasionally irritable nature.

Jedi Master Silvarte has taken to labeling Padawans with a particularly lumbering lightsaber stance as devotees of the &quot;Form of the Guid.&quot; At least one of these Padawans--since proclaimed a full Jedi Knight--has taken this mild insult to heart, developing several lightsaber techniques inspired by the study and observation of these strange creatures. Master Silvarte considers this a mark of his success as a teacher.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202870" version="1065353216">The slow-moving, gentle-tempered Gapillian grazers are herbivores that range across Ord Mantell's grassy plains. Although their massive curved tusks and rock-like hides give them a fearsome appearance, these beasts are among the most peaceful creatures inhabiting the planet. This does not mean they are entirely harmless, however.

Few things are more terrifying than a Gapillian grazer stampede at the height of mating season. With so many of these beasts grouped together, a single spooked grazer can initiate a charge capable of leveling a small town. Unwary travelers caught on foot during these catastrophic panics are rarely seen again.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202872" version="1065353216">Millennia ago, before Taris became a city-world--and long before that city was destroyed--ferrazid hounds lived in the planet's jungles and swamps, hunting birds and lizards and roaming in small packs. When Taris became an urban environment, ferrazids were believed extinct--the population wiped out, with only a few specimens preserved in zoos.

When the Republic returned to the ruins of Taris, explorers found the ferrazid hound population robust and recovered. Unfortunately, the ferrazids are extremely territorial. Although they keep their distance from major settlements, they are an increasing problem for scouts and transports.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202874" version="1065353216">Rarely seen even on its home planet of Tatooine, the omnivorous, reptilian duneclaw is an aloof and solitary creature. Possibly a distant cousin of the wraid, the duneclaw has tough skin covered in armor-like plating, and this--along with its thick skull--makes this beast very difficult to bring down. A head-butt from a duneclaw is powerful enough to shatter bones, crack stone and dent metal. 

Although its eyesight is adequate, a duneclaw is able to navigate in dim light through echolocation and can easily pick up sound waves made by other creatures. For this reason, duneclaws can often be found hunting prey near Tatooine's cliffside caves and other dark, enclosed spaces.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202878" version="1065353216">Dragonbat</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202878" version="1065353216">Dragonbats are nocturnal hunters often found in the dark places of warm and temperate worlds. They are able to draw sustenance from carrion as well from fresh meat, and this wide-ranging diet makes them adaptable to many environments--making them a pest to sentient creatures and a source of fear for fellow animals.

Dragonbats generally hunt alone or in small packs, but they occasionally gather into massive &quot;swarms.&quot; The swarm is combination mating ritual and battle royale, where the weakest of the species are culled by stronger members, who may then reproduce. While vicious, this ritual helps ensure dragonbat genetic diversity while capping the creatures' population.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202880" version="1065353216">Jurgoran</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202880" version="1065353216">These large amphibious creatures are known for their sharp claws and tough hides. They are found primarily on Dromund Kaas, where they are challenged only by the gundark for a position at the top of the food chain.

The jurgoran quickly became an image of vicious, unrelenting strength among the Sith who first came to Dromund Kaas, and there are several instances of Sith taking the name &quot;Lord Jurgoran&quot; throughout the histories.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202882" version="1065353216">Kath Hound</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202882" version="1065353216">Native to Dantooine, kath hounds are sturdy, horned creatures with a ruff of fur. Although they can be aggressive if threatened or during mating season, they are normally docile, intelligent creatures who take well to training. Kath hounds are popular across the galaxy as guard dogs and pets (although the latter usually have their horns trimmed as a precaution).

Albino kath hounds are rare and highly prized by breeders. On Dantooine, seeing an albino kath hound is considered lucky; there are even stories of albino hounds protecting people lost in the hills. While these stories are unlikely to be more than legends, an albino kath hound is large and intimidating enough to frighten off Dantooine's worst predators, kinraths, which certainly would prey on lost travelers.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202886" version="1065353216">Kintan Crusher</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202886" version="1065353216">Kintan crushers, also known as &quot;Kintan enforcers,&quot; are savage, brutish creatures native to the Nikto homeworld of Kintan. They are characterized by their stocky builds, powerful arms and large, meaty fists. Crushers are notably smarter than their cousins, the Kintan striders, and are rarely seen in the wild thanks to centuries of &quot;domestication&quot; by the Hutts; the Kintan crushers' ability to follow complex commands and pound their victims into jelly inspired the Hutts to employ them as reliable and obedient footsoldiers. Many speculate as to how the Hutts pay their Kintan enforcers, with guesses ranging from the absurd to the grotesque.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202888" version="1065353216">K'lor'slug</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202888" version="1065353216">Hulking, worm-like creatures with pincer legs and gaping maws of teeth, k'lor'slugs are among the most dangerous species on Korriban. Not only can they shear a man in half or swallow him whole, they can project their vile, venomous spit great distances. Hatched from eggs laid hundreds at a time by their queens and blessed with a short incubation period, these hideous monsters can infest and overrun an area in no time.

A century ago, a notorious hunter named Riegenn Hetuu was contracted to bring a live k'lor'slug queen to an eccentric Hutt for a gala celebration. The beast was meant to be a highlight in the Hutt's annual gladiatorial tournament, but when Riegenn arrived on Hutta and opened his cargo bay, some four hundred k'lor'slugs poured out, consuming the hunter as well as the Hutt. To this day, the sound made when a batch of k'lor'slugs hatch is called &quot;a Hutt's cry.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202892" version="1065353216">Lisk</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202892" version="1065353216">Despite its bipedal shape, the lisk is actually a carnivorous species of warm-blooded reptile suited to cold-weather climates. The &quot;hairs&quot; on its head and torso are in fact sharp, fibrous scales that help protect it from low temperatures and larger creatures. Sentient species are often surprised at how vicious a lisk can be, as its wide eyes and childlike grin give it a harmless appearance.

The lisk's two pairs of eyes are operated by different hemispheres of its brain, and are integral to its survival while sleeping. Only half of the lisk's body falls asleep at one time, allowing each pair of eyes to keep watch during half of its sleep cycle.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202894" version="1065353216">Lobel</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202894" version="1065353216">The lobel appears to be one of very few species actually indigenous to the planet Quesh, though it can be found in small pockets throughout the galaxy--perhaps the work of a single explorer thousands of years ago.

A slow-moving creature, the lobel has four stomachs that are key to its survival in some of the most ravaged ecosystems known to civilization. The slow rate of digestion and normally languid movement of the lobel has allowed it to survive even when food is very rare, and there appears to be a degree of redundancy in the four stomachs--when the toxicity of industry damages one, the lobel is able to continue eating and digesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202899" version="1065353216">Shyrack</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202899" version="1065353216">Eyeless, winged monstrosities that hunt in swarms, shyracks are cave-dwelling terrors indigenous to Korriban. Fiercely territorial, they attack intruders with aggression and frenzy.

Typically cave-bound, every sixty-three years the shyracks of Korriban spill from their habitats every day for the entire summer. They fill the sky, blotting out the sun and moon, and rain their bluish droppings onto everything below. Before the Sith returned to reclaim Korriban, every sixty-third summer saw biologists from across the galaxy descend on the planet to observe the purpling of the red terrain.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202901" version="1065353216">Shaclaw</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202901" version="1065353216">Massive, armored insects, shaclaws use their powerful foreclaws primarily for burrowing into the soil in search of the roots and subterranean mammals that make up their diet. If challenged, however, they can also use their claws as savage weapons capable of shredding the flesh or armor of their enemies.

The Gormak consider the meat of the shaclaw to be a delicacy, but within minutes of dying the insects release a deadly toxin into their tissues that contaminates the flesh. To circumvent this, the Gormak have become quite skilled at capturing shaclaws and cooking them alive.

Xenoanthropologists are quick to note that Gormak only dine on shaclaws during special coming of age feasts in which the capture and preparation of the meal is considered an essential part of the ritual celebration. The Voss reject this symbolic justification, however, and point to the practice of cooking any creature alive as proof of Gormak savagery and barbarism.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202903" version="1065353216">Savrip</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202903" version="1065353216">The savrips' bestial appearance leads many to dismiss them as nothing more than monstrous hulking predators that attack on instinct. This is far from the case, as anyone who has gotten close to a savrip can attest. Would a mindless animal really wear a tanned hide and belt made from Gapillian grazers?

Despite their brutish and primitive appearance, savrips are an intelligent species capable of communication. Unfortunately, for the average Ord Mantellian, savrips are actively hostile to other life-forms. Previously content to remain in their home territories, recent surges in savrip attacks have led authorities to speculate on a separatist-savrip alliance, but these claims remain unsubstantiated.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202905" version="1065353216">Sandtusker</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202905" version="1065353216">Predators on Tatooine have learned to give the sandtusker a wide berth, as this reptilian scavenger is far from an easy meal. Protected by ridges of bone and capable of goring flesh with its tusks, a sandtusker not only repels attempts to prey on it, but often chases down and finishes off a would-be attacker. Sandtuskers mainly feed on carrion, and their powerful maws are capable of crunching through even krayt dragon bones to reach the nutrient-rich marrow inside.

A platoon in the Republic's Thirty-eighth Infantry--several members of which had lived on Tatooine--named its armored walker &quot;the Sandtusker.&quot; True to form, it carried the soldiers safely through the harshest battles of the Great War.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202907" version="1065353216">Salky Hound</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202907" version="1065353216">Many know the salky hound for its acute senses, unbreakable claws and exceptionally powerful bite; few know this vicious beast was actually designed in a laboratory. The Republic military contracted a bioengineering firm to breed a dangerous but intelligent creature, able to protect remote bases in the Outer Rim without the expense of droids or troops.

Unfortunately, the scientists weren't able to make their creation obedient. Salky hounds turned out to be ferocious and impossible to train for military action. After several accidental deaths, the Republic military canceled the contract, and salky hounds were banned from the Core Worlds. 

However, many breeding pairs were sold quietly on the black market, and the hounds have appeared on dozens of worlds since. Many mercenary and criminal organizations deploy salky hounds when they have no need to capture someone alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202909" version="1065353216">Rill</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202909" version="1065353216">One of the swiftest land animals on Tatooine, the rill is a reptilian predator that hunts womp rats and other large mammals. Fiercely territorial, an individual rill (or a rill and its young) stakes out a patch of desert and defends it vigorously against all intruders. To sleep and protect itself from Tatooine's blistering heat, the rill burrows into the sand several meters below the surface.

These nests are also where rills lay their eggs, burying the eggs under sand to hide them from scavengers. The first task of a newly hatched rill is to successfully dig its way back up to the surface, or else be abandoned by its mother and broodmates.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202911" version="1065353216">Reek</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202911" version="1065353216">Reeks are horned, thick-skinned herbivores. They originally hail from the planet Ylesia but can be found all over the galaxy, particularly on Iridonia, Ithor and Tatooine. They are highly sought-after as pack animals, but are also commonly used as mounts.

Curiously, reeks' temperaments are largely dictated by their diets. While they normally subsist on plants, reeks will eat meat if it is offered to them; however, a carnivorous diet turns their skin dark red and makes them extremely hostile. This phenomenon inspired the phrase &quot;mad as a red reek&quot; and has led to the practice of using battle-maddened reeks in gladiatorial arenas.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202913" version="1065353216">Razoronn</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202913" version="1065353216">One of the only carnivores capable of taking down a Gapillian grazer by itself, razoronn beasts are nearly three meters in length and weigh over a thousand kilograms. It is no exaggeration to state that these tusked, fanged beasts present a serious threat to anything smaller than an armored shuttlecraft.

During the early settlement of Ord Mantell, a small farming convoy broke down on a remote plain at nightfall and fell prey to a razoronn pack. The curious predators began &quot;investigating&quot; these intruders in their hunting grounds. The farmers' landspeeders offered no shelter from the ravenous creatures. By morning, all but one of the farmers had been dragged away.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202915" version="1065353216">Rancor</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202915" version="1065353216">Rancors are reptilian monstrosities known as some of the galaxy's most dangerous predators. Although indigenous to the planet Dathomir, they have spread to many other worlds and thrived in many environments. Rancors are a favorite among the wealthiest underworld crime lords, who raise them from eggs to become (relatively) tame pets. Those whose rancors survive to adulthood are afforded a great deal of status, as well as a powerful weapon against their enemies.

A unique feature of the rancor is its tough hide--a mixture of fine scales, thick skin and bony plates. Blaster bolts and vibroblades have little effect upon the hide, and while these attributes fade from a hide removed from a rancor carcass, a few lucky hunters nonetheless wear ornamental outfits made from the material.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202917" version="1065353216">Rakghoul</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202917" version="1065353216">Rakghouls are a living plague--the manifestation of a highly communicable disease capable of swiftly transforming its victims into twisted, degenerate monsters with predatory instincts. The rakghoul virus can infect hundreds of known species and is most often delivered through a rakghoul's bite; a person attacked by a rakghoul and &quot;lucky&quot; enough to survive typically becomes a rakghoul him- or herself. Some victims resist the virus for days, succumbing to rakghoul instincts while retaining their original bodies.

Different strains of the virus manifest in different breeds of rakghoul--the smallest and weakest travel in enormous colonies, whereas larger, smarter rakghouls often hunt alone. The virus mutates fastest when infecting new species, and slowest when rakghouls reproduce with other rakghouls. 

Before the planet's bombardment, Taris contained its substantial rakghoul population in the undercity. Many specialists believe rakghouls are native to Taris, but rare outbreaks elsewhere in the galaxy suggest the truth is more complicated.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202919" version="1065353216">Pantran Whitefang</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202919" version="1065353216">The sleek and lethal whitefang cats are noteworthy for having bodies composed almost entirely of muscle. These felines do not store any fat, and consequently must constantly be on the hunt. They are the only creatures on Hoth capable of matching a tauntaun's running speed.

Certain enterprising crime lords have attempted to train captured whitefangs for use as guard animals. These experiments have routinely ended in disaster for trainers and beasts alike. On the other hand, underground death duel arenas have profited tremendously from the spectacle these untamed creatures can provide.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202921" version="1065353216">Orobird</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202921" version="1065353216">Orobirds are a species of tall, flightless avians noted for their distinctive plumage and loud, squawking calls. Their very existence baffles scientists: colorful, loud and dumb, orobirds should be easy prey for predators and poachers, yet they can be found thriving on a multitude of worlds. Many attribute the orobirds' continued survival to their brutish temperament and odious flavor; orobird meat is generally considered one of the foulest in the galaxy, though some wealthy highbrows insist the taste is an acquired one.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202923" version="1065353216">Nexu</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202923" version="1065353216">Native to the forests of the planet Cholganna, the feline nexu have become alpha predators throughout the galaxy over the past few centuries, adapting to new environments through a natural hardiness and a quick reproductive cycle. Packs of nexu have been found roaming the tundra of Mygeeto and the steaming jungles of Rodia, equally adept at stalking and killing prey.

Nexu are recognized in many cultures as an icon of viciousness, and several Mandalorian clans have taken the creature as their symbol. Some xenobiologists argue that nexu are far less violent than common wisdom suggests, and that it's the activities of sentient beings that agitate the cats. Left alone, they're smart, capable and strong--but not cruel or aggressive.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202925" version="1065353216">Nerf</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202925" version="1065353216">Nerfs are large, shaggy pack animals raised for their meat, fur and hides, primarily characterized by their horns, surly disposition and horrid stench. Their tendency to spit on people has only cemented their reputation for being particularly unpleasant animals to handle; it's no surprise that nerf-herding is regarded as one of the less glamorous professions in the galaxy.

Although they are native to Alderaan, the nerfs' hardiness has allowed them to adapt to a variety of climates on other planets. Nerfs are common livestock on many Core and Inner Rim planets, though most ranchers beyond the Mid Rim prefer to breed less unruly animals.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202927" version="1065353216">Nekghoul</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202927" version="1065353216">Rakghouls evolve with incredible speed, but until recently, they had never shown signs of intelligence. Larger and far smarter than their rakghoul cousins, nekghouls may qualify as a new species in their own right--they appear unable to infect and transform their victims, but instead possess sensitivity to the Force and violent, untrained talent in its use.

Although nekghouls are capable of speech, they have no known history or record of their origins. Are they the result of a Jedi or Sith being infected with the rakghoul virus? A mutation caused by radiation from Taris's shattered reactors? Studies may have to wait--for now, merely surviving the presence of these horrific beings is difficult enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202931" version="1065353216">Mawvorr</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202931" version="1065353216">Carnivorous beasts that stalk the wilderness outside Voss-Ka, mawvorrs are generally considered opportunistic hunters. They prefer striking at whatever wounded predators or wandering humanoids they come across to carefully hunting and stalking their food, though in packs they exhibit increased aggression and have been known to attack even the mighty vorantikus.

Mawvorrs also typically attack Gormak on sight, though they refuse to eat the bodies afterwards. This odd behavior has led the Voss to perceive mawvorrs as guardians or protectors who abhor the Gormak. Because of this, the Voss take steps to maintain the mawvorr population around Voss-Ka. 

This symbiotic relationship can be taken to extremes during times when the mawvorr food supply is low. There is a historical account of a Mystic's vision resulting in unarmed Voss wandering out into the wilderness and allowing themselves to be devoured by mawvorr packs.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202933" version="1065353216">Mantellian Flutterplume</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202933" version="1065353216">Although its beautiful feathers are valued as good luck charms, everything else about the Mantellian flutterplume is worth avoiding. This enormous scavenger bird is noted for its impressive hook-like beak and four sets of curled talons--tools that it uses to tear apart and consume rotting carcasses.

The flutterplume population has skyrocketed thanks to Ord Mantell's brutal civil war. An abundant supply of fresh battlefield kills attracts flocks of these carrion eaters. Soldiers whisper horror stories of wounded men unable to defend themselves and doomed by the hungry winged predators.

Subspecies of the Mantellian flutterplume have evolved on a handful of other Republic worlds where the birds have been imported. Like their ancestors, they are both elegant and aggressive.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202935" version="1065353216">Manka Cat</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202935" version="1065353216">Fierce feline hunters, manka cats are believed to have originated on Alderaan but can now be found on a number of different worlds due to their desirability as exotic pets or trained guardians. It is no surprise that these accomplished hunters have thrived in virtually every ecosystem into which they have been introduced. Sleek and powerful, they have the speed to run down smaller prey, while their massive protruding tusks and claws also allow them to tackle much larger targets. Often traveling in prides, even a lone manka cat can be dangerous, and extreme caution should be exercised when in their territory. Despite the risks, manka cats are sometimes hunted for sport and for their tusks and teeth, which are said to possess healing properties.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202939" version="1065353216">Lurker</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202939" version="1065353216">Lean, amphibious bipeds with a tendency to travel in packs, lurkers are carrion eaters most comfortable in tropical environments. Alone, they usually avoid confronting danger, crawling into tight spaces and observing potential threats from a distance. In numbers, they can strike with a rabid, frenzied intensity, happily downing prey for later consumption.

Biologists serving the Hutt Cartel believe that lurkers originated on a nameless jungle world on the edges of the Torch Nebula. They were first identified in the wider galaxy two hundred years ago, and have begun appearing on more and more worlds ever since. No convincing explanation for the lurkers' spread has been offered, leaving the creatures a disturbing mystery.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202941" version="1065353216">Skel</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202941" version="1065353216">Despite their diminutive stature, the vicious and intelligent skels are a potential wild card in the three-way war for Hoth. Skels hunt in packs, are capable of wielding primitive weapons and are biologically adapted to survival on Hoth's frozen plains. Their bony claws are capable of burrowing through even the thickest snow and ice, allowing them to spring devastating surprise attacks.

Imperial war strategists dismiss the skels as a threat, but Republic soldiers are encouraged to report any mass gatherings of skels immediately. Long before the Republic, the Empire or the White Maw came to Hoth, the planet belonged to the skels--and these well-organized natives may decide to eliminate the unwelcome invaders.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202946" version="1065353216">Zeldrate</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202946" version="1065353216">The zeldrate is a sleek predator that used to hunt bormus in the Balmorran plains--but with the bormu population dwindling, the zeldrate has increasingly targeted sentient prey. Imperial troops and resistance fighters wounded during battle are common victims, but bolder zeldrates have assaulted full squads.

Prior to the invasion, zeldrates were hunted for a caustic chemical secretion useful as a cleaning solution for industrial parts. Today, with Balmorran industry operating below half capacity, the zeldrate population has seen a slight increase--balanced by the fact that they are often killed seeking easy prey on the battlefield.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202949" version="1065353216">Yozusk</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202949" version="1065353216">Yozusks were originally referred to as &quot;rock wardens&quot; by the Sith when they arrived on Dromund Kaas, because they nested in the cliffsides around the jungle and because of the hard, rocky protrusions on their backs. Though they are extremely territorial, they primarily feed on animals living beneath the ground, which they dig up with their long arms. They are nocturnal creatures and rely primarily on their sense of smell in the darkness. They are incredibly strong, and many young thrill-seekers cut their teeth fighting the yozusks before moving on to the larger, more powerful gundarks.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202951" version="1065353216">Xuvva</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202951" version="1065353216">The flapping of thick, hairless wings is often the last sound heard by a victim of the deadly xuvvas. Their fangs bite with brutal precision, quickly disabling prey while filling the xuvvas' swollen stomachs. The creatures then take flight and hunt down their next meal using sensitive electroreceptors in their horn-like antenna. A single xuvva is capable of killing a trained hunter; an entire flock can reduce a mature Hutt to bones in minutes.

Unknown to most, xuvvas are distant relations to the decidedly less vicious mynocks. Like their parasitic cousins, xuvvas latch onto power sources and leech their electrical energy. Ten years ago, an entire xuvva flock sapped enough power from a subterranean conduit to cause a blackout over half of Jiguuna. In a fit of fury, Nem'ro the Hutt placed a bounty on the creatures that was quickly called off when his palace became littered with the trophies of dead xuvvas.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202953" version="1065353216">Wraid</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202953" version="1065353216">Hunting dangerous predators is a tradition on Tatooine, and stalking the deadly wraid is often a test to separate the amateurs from the experts. In addition to its great strength and powerful jaws, a wraid is able to quickly cover large distances by breaking into a bounding sprint. The impact of its massive forelegs creates highly distinctive tracks in the sand for hunters to either follow or avoid.

Rumors persist across Tatooine of a gigantic &quot;alpha&quot; wraid that stalks deep in the desert wastes. Some hunters claim to have seen it; others tell tales of stumbling across its oversized claw prints before the desert wind blew them away. Its existence, however, has never been confirmed.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202955" version="1065353216">Womp Rat</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202955" version="1065353216">Carnivorous rodents native to Tatooine, womp rats are a menace to any permanent settlement. They reproduce at a staggering rate and are known to stalk urban alleyways and remote moisture farms alike, prompting some authorities to maintain a standing bounty on the creatures. Vicious and ill-tempered, they prefer meals of organic debris and runoff--but even lone womp rats will attack any creature that gets too close, often spreading virulent disease.

When found in the desert, womp rats also hunt in packs, emerging from burrows and swarming their unfortunate victims in a flurry of claws and teeth. A dozen womp rats can overwhelm a full-grown dewback in just a few seconds, and larger packs regularly feast on fresh bantha.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202957" version="1065353216">Wingmaws are a biological oddity, an evolutionary branch of Balmorran life that developed on an isolated chain of islands; it was only six hundred years ago that wingmaws were accidentally carried to the mainland by unwary explorers. The creatures maintain insect-like social structures despite their reptilian appearance, frequently traveling in groups and favoring open spaces to dark caves.

The wingmaw population on Balmorra has increased rapidly since the Imperial invasion, as the creatures' primary predator--the Balmorran maweater, another transplant from the island chain--was completely wiped out during the bombardment. Unchecked, the wingmaw has become a threat to Imperial and resistance soldiers alike and wreaked havoc on the rest of the Balmorran ecosystem. They are bold carnivores and scavengers, happily swarming on a lone fighter or an unprepared convoy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202959" version="1065353216">Wampa</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202959" version="1065353216">The fearsome wampa is Hoth's apex predator. These surprisingly intelligent beasts pose a major hazard to unwary travelers, especially those wandering near unexplored caves. More than one combat patrol has vanished after seeking shelter in a seemingly unoccupied ice cavern. Among fresh arrivals to the planet, horror stories circulate of men swallowed whole by these towering creatures.

The more terrifying truth is that wampas prefer fresh meat and rarely kill a victim outright, instead stunning or incapacitating prey. Future meals are dragged back to a wampa's lair and suspended immobilized from the cave's ceiling. Wampa victims may have hours or even days to contemplate their eventual fates.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202961" version="1065353216">Vulagools are a species of small, hunched bipeds most commonly found on Alderaan. They are primarily scavengers, though they are known to bring down larger animals in packs.

While their planet of origin is unclear, some researchers believe vulagools were once a sentient species driven to near-extinction by the Killiks and brought to Alderaan to work in the Killik hives millennia ago. Others suggest the vulagools are themselves descended from Killik Joiners who mutated unexpectedly and were driven from the nests. Whatever their true nature, vulagools seem to both fear and hate the Killiks and do whatever they can to steer clear of the insectoids.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202963" version="1065353216">Indigenous to the planet Varl, vrblthers were often kept as pets by rich and powerful Hutts. When Varl was vaporized over ten thousand years ago, the species survived only because many of the fierce bipedal predators had accompanied their owners to Nar Shaddaa and Hutta.

The beasts proved resilient to the pollutants and toxins commonly found in their new environments, and their numbers grew rapidly. Packs of vrblthers are known to roam the lower levels of Nar Shaddaa, in constant search of their next meal.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202965" version="1065353216">Vorn tigers are a dangerous breed of feline predators distinguished by their distinctive horns and sleek coats. They are solitary hunters by nature and most are extremely territorial. They typically avoid major settlements but are absolutely merciless to anyone unlucky enough to wander into their hunting grounds.

Vorn tigers often mark their territory by gouging bark from trees with their horns. Zoologists have noted that these markings are both unique and consistent--each vorn tiger seems to scratch in a consistent and unique pattern.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202969" version="1065353216">Varactyl</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202969" version="1065353216">Originating on the planet Utapau, where they were trained and used extensively as mounts, the varactyl has become a popular mode of non-mechanized transportation across the galaxy. As a result, the reptavian creatures have thrived on a great many worlds, both as mounts and in the wild.

The most famous varactyl-rider, Hrosus the Swift, was able to coax his mount to phenomenal speeds, once beating a swoop bike in a head-to-head race. This same speed makes varactyl formidable opponents; although they can be peaceful, loving creatures when among creatures they view as friendly, they are highly territorial and viciously protect their nests from aggressors.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202971" version="1065353216">Deceptively aggressive, uxibeasts are mammalian herbivores with a multitude of horns covering their shaggy bodies. They are believed to originate on Tython, but have been found in small numbers on other planets--evidence of the migration of the first Jedi, long ago. They typically travel in herds and are quite capable of fending off would-be predators; the pointed spines on their backs prevent attackers from pouncing on them, and a charging uxibeast is capable of inflicting all kinds of bodily harm.

Uxibeasts are generally ill-tempered and unpleasant around people, but they can be tamed--to a degree. Domesticated uxibeasts will imprint on a single individual, whom they are unquestionably loyal to, while remaining hostile toward everyone else.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202973" version="1065353216">These oversized hounds were bred to be fearless and relentless. Left to guard the Sith tombs of Korriban, they have sharp horns, long claws and savage teeth. They are unusually intelligent and seem capable of communicating with one another through unknown means.

It is said that the species was nonviolent and grazing before being corrupted by Sith alchemical experiments that awakened a latent part of their brains and changed them into unnatural abominations. Random mutations now occur that produce some tuk'ata that can live for centuries and grow to immense proportions.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202975" version="1065353216">Cat-like and deadly, the Trinthan prowler originated in the Trinith system before being sold across the galaxy for use as trained hunters and trackers. After a string of incidents where bystanders were badly mauled, the Republic made Trinthan prowler breeding illegal and a large number of the beasts were released into the wild. They can now be found on a great many planets, where their predatory skills have allowed them to thrive feeding on smaller, slower and weaker creatures.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="202977" version="1065353216">Thranta</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202977" version="1065353216">Thrantas are a species of flying animals indigenous to Alderaan. Their powerful wing muscles and internal air sacs allow them to stay aloft while carrying large amounts of weight, making them perfect aerial mounts. Early Alderaanian colonists made extensive use of thrantas, using them for personal and military transport.

Their popularity on Alderaan generated an enormous demand for the animals on Coruscant; thousands of thrantas were transplanted, but they were unable to survive the city-world's heavy air pollution. Since that debacle, the Alderaanians have refused to export the thrantas offworld and hunting them on Alderaan is strictly forbidden. This has only made thranta smuggling and thranta poaching more appealing in certain circles.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202979" version="1065353216">The legendary terentatek is a vicious, tusked monster that feeds on the blood of Force sensitives. Terentateks are known to cluster wherever there is a strong dark side presence and to remain dormant for many years before emerging to hunt.

How terentateks came to be is a subject of much debate. Ancient chronicles report terentatek-like creatures on Korriban, twisted by the dark side rituals performed by early Dark Jedi. Other sources attribute their creation directly to the Sith Lord Exar Kun, who performed many Force experiments on creatures on Yavin 4. Terentateks are undoubtedly one of the most vicious of all creatures steeped in the dark side, and they are doubly dangerous because of their unnatural resistance to Force powers.

Jedi throughout the ages have tried to wipe terentateks from the galaxy, but the creatures have proven incredibly resilient. The most recent concerted effort was three centuries ago; many terentateks were destroyed, but the hunt took the lives of many Jedi Masters, as well.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202981" version="1065353216">The tauntaun is an omnivorous reptomammal occupying a key position in Hoth's ecosystem. Beyond providing a food source for wampas and the feline whitefangs, tauntauns also expand the planet's natural tundra by spreading fast-growing moss and lichen to new growth areas. In fact, scientists speculate that Hoth's limited fauna would quickly go extinct if the tauntauns disappeared.

More important to Republic, Imperial and White Fang forces on Hoth, tauntauns provide the promise of a native means of traversing the icy plains. Adult tauntauns can move at speeds of up to ninety kilometers per hour--useful for outrunning all manner of foes. The trick, of course, is domesticating these notoriously ill-tempered beasts.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202983" version="1065353216">Sleek and web-footed, the sleen is among the fastest creatures that crawl through the Dromund Kaas jungle. It feeds primarily on the eggs of other Dromund Kaas lizards, but it has been known to hunt small prey and can be vicious in protecting its territory against intruders.

The early Sith were known to keep sleens as guard animals and pets, but the practice went out of favor as Dromund Kaas became more densely populated and the sleens proved difficult to keep in close quarters. Hunting sleens are still kept among certain high-ranking Imperial military officers, bred and trained by generations of family servants.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="202985" version="1065353216">Skyslashers are flying predators with a gruesome appearance, compact masses of bone, muscle and wings. Although they have poor eyesight, skyslashers have evolved a powerful sense of smell that allows them to not only detect victims at a distance, but tell whether they are injured or exhausted enough to be easy prey.

The bad eyesight of skyslashers may be no accident. The Sith Lord Erindax had an interest in creating new species and bred the first skyslashers centuries ago as a hobby. He overestimated his control of the creatures, however, and was blinded in one eye when the flock suddenly turned on him. Afterward, Erindax engineered his skyslashers to be almost blind; either out of fear for his remaining eye, or to avenge himself on his wayward pets.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203465" version="1065353216">The Kubaz are long-snouted aliens renowned for the secretive hand signals they use to communicate with each other. These signals, combined with their ability to see even with very little light, make them experts at covert communications, and as a result, they are commonly employed as espionage agents by forces on both sides of the galactic conflict.

Even in the underworld, Kubaz are used to broker deals in silence, in the shadows. One of the most famous Kubaz was a triple agent who worked for the Hutt Cartel, providing them with information on both the Republic and the Sith Empire so the Hutts could reap the rewards of the conflict.</text>

Since its victories against the forces of the Tion Cluster, the Hutt Empire had continued to expand its influence. It now controlled dozens of systems, and the Hutt criminal enterprises extended even into Republic space.

But the greed of the Hutts was insatiable, and their long life spans meant grudges could be carried for centuries. Rivalries became open hostilities, until their entire empire was embroiled in the &quot;Hutt Cataclysms,&quot; a series of conflicts that saw devastating weapons unleashed on Hutt-controlled worlds.

When the cataclysms ended, the Hutt homeworld of Varl and hundreds of Hutt colonies had been rendered lifeless. Seeking a new homeworld, the Hutts began relocating to the planet Evocar, slowly buying parcels of land from the Evocii people. Eventually, the Hutts owned the entire planet, which would later be called Nal Hutta--or more often, simply &quot;Hutta,&quot; the &quot;Glorious Jewel.&quot;</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203469" version="1065353216">The heavily armored, sharp-toothed vine cat can pounce up to eight meters and has been known to tear a sleen apart in less than ten seconds. Its armored frill and hide protect it against larger predators such as the jurgoran, and its claws make it an expert climber when it needs to get away. The vine cat was introduced to Dromund Kaas by the early Sith from the dark forest world of Ziost and is responsible for wiping out three of Dromund Kaas's native herbivorous species to date.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="203471" version="1065353216">The Citadel</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203471" version="1065353216">The Citadel stands at the heart of Kaas City, a monument to the Sith Empire's strength and home to its most powerful Dark Lords. The Ministries of War, Intelligence and Logistics are all headquartered here, along with a Mandalorian enclave. The Emperor's Dark Council gathers to meet in the Citadel when not on the Sith holy world of Korriban.

The original Citadel mimicked the designs of Korriban's Sith Academy and the Great Citadel on Ziost, but it was destroyed four hundred years ago when two members of the Dark Council fought an ancient Sith duel, called the Kaggath, on its grounds. The duel was a draw, and both of the combatants were executed by the remaining Dark Council members, who oversaw the rebuilding of the Citadel in its current form.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203472" version="1065353216">The most recent architectural addition to the Citadel, the Mandalorian enclave is reserved for the Empire's allies among the mercenary Mandalorian warrior clans. Although it may appear to be a simple embassy from the outside, the proceedings inside are anything but diplomatic. The enclave is a place where new warriors come to test themselves against the Mandalorians and compete in violent (and often deadly) tournaments, as well as where the best among the Mandalorians help plan the Empire's next strikes.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="203473" version="1065353216">Imperial Intelligence</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203473" version="1065353216">Behind the Sith and the powerful Imperial military is the vast network of agents, information gatherers, deception specialists and strategists that makes up Imperial Intelligence. Part spy organization, part secret police, Imperial Intelligence handles all of the Empire's covert operations--guarding the Empire's secrets, acquiring valuable intel from the Republic, hunting down traitors and cleaning up messes created by unhinged Sith Lords.

Imperial Intelligence reports to the Minister of Intelligence, who in turn reports directly to the Dark Council. Not a military organization, Imperial Intelligence officers are nonetheless viewed with respect by military and civilian personnel--it's Intelligence that can judge a person as loyal or traitorous, arrange the advancement of a career or the blacklisting of a powerful leader.

A place in Imperial Intelligence is a coveted rank, reserved for some of the best of the Empire's non-Force sensitive subjects. In some cases, officers are &quot;poached&quot; by Sith Lords seeking to build their own specialized intelligence networks; for the most part, however, Intelligence personnel go unnoticed by anyone outside the organization. The best agents are the ones no one's ever heard of.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203477" version="1065353216">The Sith Sanctum is the heart of the Sith Order on Dromund Kaas, where lords gather and where the Dark Council meets when not on the Imperial burial world of Korriban. The Emperor himself is believed to have chambers in the sanctum's lower levels, though none save the council and the Imperial Guard are allowed into its depths.

The original Citadel, like the Sith Academy on Korriban, was off-limits to everyone but the Sith. After the Citadel was rebuilt, the headquarters of the three Imperial ministries were added; more recently, the Mandalorian enclave was given a wing within the sprawling building. As a result, chambers in the Sith Sanctum have become an increased source of conflict and backstabbing among aspiring Sith. A place in the Sith Sanctum signifies aspirations to the Dark Council, or a prominent role in the direct governing of Dromund Kaas.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203478" version="1065353216">When the Sith discovered Dromund Kaas, it was an untamed jungle world, uninhabited by any sentient species. Over centuries, gleaming and orderly Imperial cities have spread to cover most of the planet, but stretches of harsh, untamed wilderness remain. Populated by violent predators such as the gundark and jurgoran, the wilds separate Kaas City from its spaceport and are best navigated at a safe distance, by speeder, rather than on foot.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203479" version="1065353216">Outsiders in Sith society, followers of the philosophies of the mysterious Darth Revan meet in a hidden enclave in the jungles of Dromund Kaas, submitting any who want to join them to rigorous tests to establish their loyalty and sincerity.

Originally, the Revanites met in Kaas City to study Revan's teachings, but as suspicions arose about the Revanites' loyalties to the Emperor and the Dark Council, they were forced to conceal their activities. At first, they took shelter in the compound of a prominent Sith Lord, but when that Sith was assassinated (presumably for supporting the Revanites), they were forced to relocate their sacred texts and relics and build their sanctuary in the jungle.

Revanites inside the Imperial military and the Sith have kept the compound from appearing on most scans of the area. Explorers who stumble upon the compound are rarely heard from again.</text>

The Republic had been established on principles of free speech and tolerance for all sentient beings. Unfortunately, these principles also allowed the growth of fringe groups. During the term of Supreme Chancellor Pers'lya, a fanatical pro-human religious sect calling itself &quot;Pius Dea&quot; emerged.

Many dismissed Pius Dea as just another cult, but the group's intentions were much more sinister. Through political maneuvering, the members conspired to have Chancellor Pers'lya impeached and their own man, Senator Contispex, put in his place. Through Supreme Chancellor Contispex, Pius Dea exploited tensions within the Hutt Empire after the Hutt Cataclysms. Eventually Contispex sanctioned an invasion of Hutt Space, beginning the Pius Dea Crusades.

Over the next thousand years, Contispex's descendants--biological and ideological--would inherit his position, continuing to wage war against various alien factions until growing unrest brought Pius Dea's rule to an end. A new Chancellor was elected, free of Pius Dea's influence, and the Pius Dea &quot;Supreme Temple&quot; was destroyed... but the tensions created between the Core Worlds and the Outer Rim persisted for centuries to come.</text>

After the Pius Dea Crusades, the Republic stagnated, forced to rebuild alliances Pius Dea had damaged. However, during the Rianitus Period, the Republic began to enjoy prosperity again under a new Supreme Chancellor, Blotus the Hutt.

Blotus had been the administrator of a network of mining worlds that split from the remnants of the former Hutt Empire. He and his worlds applied for Republic membership, and although tensions between Hutts and the Republic remained, Blotus proved both competent and popular in the Galactic Senate. He was eventually elected Supreme Chancellor by an overwhelming majority, and his position was solidified when his tax breaks for independent traders brought Coruscant into an economic boom and improved trade throughout the Core Worlds.

Blotus served a 275-year term and died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 912. His rule would be remembered with affection for centuries; even today, his favorite chair in the Senate tower's lounge is traditionally left empty.</text>

The culture of the gray-skinned Taung species had always been defined by conflict, even before their days battling the Battalions of Zhell on Coruscant. For millennia, striking out from the world they called Mandalore, the Taung explored and conquered new worlds, seeking new opponents to test themselves against.

Over time their philosophy of battle grew and changed, and a new cadre of elite warriors emerged. Known as the Mandalorian Crusaders, these warriors were honed by years of battle and guided by a strict code of honor. Wild stories began to spread throughout the Outer Rim of soldiers who could disappear into forests, face terrifying beasts without a trace of fear or even capture an entire planet in a day.

These tales were the first time the name &quot;Mandalorian&quot; became widely known. Although the Taung themselves went into decline and eventually disappeared, they left behind followers trained as they were. Ever after, the Mandalorians were a people to be respected, and feared.</text>

The Jedi Order had already faced one great schism in its history, against the fallen Xendor and his Legions of Lettow. Although Xendor had been gone for centuries, there were uneasy stirrings in the order's ranks. A group of Jedi had learned to use the Force to shape living beings, twisting them into horrific monsters.

These Dark Jedi were swiftly exiled, but they retaliated by raising an army of their monstrous creations and unleashing them against the rest of the order. The Jedi fought back, finally driving the Dark Jedi to a last stand on the planet Corbos. 

Victory would not have been certain even then, but the Dark Jedi had begun to turn against one another. Without a united front, they were overwhelmed and scattered. Although the Jedi cheered their victory, it was later discovered that many of the Dark Jedi had fled Corbos, leaving no trail for anyone to follow.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203683" version="1065353216">This strange, suspended monument was commissioned by the late Dark Council member Darth Gorgos in celebration of the Empire's victorious return to the galaxy and the Sacking of Coruscant. It is the work of the Empire's finest engineers and took three hundred slaves to build. The cascading prisms symbolize both the ascendancy of the Sith and the downfall of their enemies. The split centerpiece that supports the edifice represents the Emperor. Darth Gorgos was murdered by her apprentice before the statue was finished, but her successor oversaw its completion.</text>

Commissioned by a follower of Ergast's teachings two centuries after the Sith Lord supposedly lived and using that follower as its model, a small inscription near its base claims that Ergast &quot;invented the methods used by all inquisitors to wring life from the living and the dead.&quot; Computer records contain little information on Ergast, suggesting only that he was among the first Sith to permanently settle on Dromund Kaas, and that he was probably buried there.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203688" version="1065353216">Fear is a powerful weapon, and those who wield it can rule the galaxy. The Phobis devices were constructed for just that purpose. Brimming with dark energy, their mere presence was enough to spark crippling horror in the bravest of minds. Many Sith who meditated on the devices were driven mad by their attempt. Only the lost Sith Dread Masters successfully harnessed and perfected the Phobis devices' frightening power.

Three known Phobis devices exist, and the Emperor sealed one of them--the Core--within his Dark Temple. Although its dormant components have been scavenged, the Phobis Core remains active and will likely spread fear and hysteria for generations to come.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203689" version="1065353216">The Sith Lord Parnax vanished forty years ago, leaving no one to mourn his passing. Deeply unpopular even among his own family, Parnax spent his brief career betraying every ally while acquiring an impressive list of highly placed enemies. Whether consumed by arrogance or simply too stupid to predict his eventual fate, he appears to have deliberately invaded the Dark Temple long before the most recent incursion, seeking the key to the Emperor's power.

According to the last few entries of his journals, Parnax found himself unable to leave the Dark Temple after entering it, becoming lost and disoriented. His recordings descend into mad, incoherent ramblings about an all-consuming darkness extinguishing all life in the galaxy. Convinced he could survive this coming doom by merging with the Force, Parnax illogically schemed to end his own life.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="203690" version="1065353216">Forged in a time before Sith wielded lightsabers, the ceremonial executioner's blade was later used by Sith Lord Koval Renge who preferred the tactile weapon over his traditional lightsaber. Lord Renge used the blade to dispatch hundreds of the Emperor's enemies and earned the title of Sith Executioner.

As the Emperor's power grew, so did Renge's fear of his master. Fear turned to betrayal, but Renge's plot did not escape the Emperor's notice. As punishment, the executioner's blade was turned on its owner. Renge resisted, but the blade struck true and broke off in his chest.

Renge was not permitted the escape of death. His wounds were healed, and the tainted splinter of his blade remained buried inside him. He was then cast into the Dark Temple, the agonizing splinter a constant reminder of the Emperor's cruel benevolence.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="205252" version="1065353216">Abyssins are a nomadic and savage species from the planet Byss. They are distinguished most obviously by the single large eye centered prominently on their foreheads. They are also notoriously hard to kill, possessing incredible regenerative abilities that allow them to recover from virtually any non-fatal wound.

The Abyssins' uncanny resilience has no doubt contributed to their violent culture. While bloody conflicts between warring tribes are all too common, casualties from these skirmishes are surprisingly few. Their fortitude makes them ideal hired muscle, and they often find work throughout the galaxy as mercenaries and bodyguards.</text>

Prior to Urkupp's destruction, they were feared for their inherent resistance to the Force; Jedi and Sith alike often found their powers useless against the Dashades. While the Jedi generally preferred to avoid them, many Sith Lords took advantage of their unique abilities and employed Dashades as assassins to dispose of Jedi and rival Sith.</text>

The term &quot;Sith pureblood&quot; is now used to distinguish between those descended from the species and the order itself.

The Sith species was discovered three thousand years ago on Korriban by exiled human Dark Jedi fleeing Republic space after their defeat in a war called the Second Great Schism. The Dark Jedi quickly enslaved the primitive culture, and over many generations, the two groups intermingled.

Eventually, the elite ruling class of Korriban consisted almost exclusively of the hybridized offspring of the Dark Jedi and the high priests of the Sith people. These offspring tended to exhibit the physical characteristics of their Sith parentage, such as red skin, yellow eyes, bony protrusions on the face or head, and fleshy tendrils dangling from the cheeks and chin. For a brief time, Sith blood was seen as a sign of weakness--but the modern Empire believes purity of heritage carries the strength of the Force.

Genetically speaking, true &quot;pureblood&quot; Sith are virtually extinct, but red skin is still the mark of an Imperial--almost always a Force user--who can trace his or her ancestry into antiquity.</text>

Although the Republic has existed for millennia, there is evidence to suggest that long before its founding, a highly advanced race ruled the galaxy. Referred to as the &quot;Architects&quot; or &quot;Celestials&quot; by scholars, these beings possessed remarkable technology capable of constructing or realigning solar systems. The Corellia system, for example, appears to have been artificially constructed.

These claims would seem extraordinary, but many of the Architects' machines survived the ages. The Vultar system was home to an immense &quot;Cosmic Turbine&quot; that could only have been Architect technology, before misuse destroyed both the turbine and the Vultar system itself. The fabled Centerpoint Station is thought to be an Architect installation, though many species have claimed it as the work of their own people.

In addition to their engineering marvels, it is believed that the Architects seeded the Core Worlds with life--particularly humans--though some attribute this to the Rakata's Infinite Empire. Despite the proof of their achievements, however, there is little evidence to suggest where the Architects came from or what eventually became of them.</text>

On the planet Tython, an order of philosophers and researchers arose, studying the mysterious energy that permeates all things--an energy known as the Force. However, disagreements developed within the order about how this energy should be used, leading to the Force Wars that eventually engulfed the planet. A faction comprised of those who followed a more peaceful path left Tython and established itself on the planet Ossus; later, this faction called itself the Jedi Order. 

At their new enclave, the Jedi refined a code that would guide them. They became a monastic warrior people, devoting themselves to the pursuit of peace and knowledge, rather than personal power.

In the wake of the Force Wars, the Jedi also had a new understanding of the Force. They saw that the Force, while naturally light, could be used for corrupt ends. Those who did not respect its power risked falling to the dark side.</text>

For centuries, safe and reliable travel through hyperspace had been the biggest obstacle to galactic exploration. Finally, Corellian scientists managed to perfect hyperdrive technology on par with that of the ancient Rakata, allowing travel between the Core Worlds in mere days. Joined by trade and renewed communication channels, the Core Worlds signed an accord and united as the first Galactic Republic.

The newborn Republic began exploration of hyperspace routes in earnest, supported by daring Duros scouts and eventually established the Perlemian Trade Route. This route connected Coruscant to many worlds, including Ossus, where the Jedi Order's enclave had been established centuries before. The Jedi welcomed Republic scouts with curiosity and interest.

The head of the enclave, Master Haune Tiar, returned with the scouts to the allied Core Worlds. Impressed by what he saw, Master Tiar also foresaw the young Republic would need protectors. After conferring for several weeks, the Jedi pledged themselves as the Republic's guardians of peace and justice. The foundations for the modern Republic were laid.</text>

The gray-skinned Taung species, which clashed with humans long before the formation of the Republic, had lost none of its fearsome reputation over the years. The Taung revered conflict in all forms, relishing the chance to test themselves against powerful enemies.

While the young Republic continued to expand, the Taung also sought out and colonized many worlds. Eventually they discovered an Outer Rim planet populated by enormous, vicious beasts called mythosaurs. The Taung took the world for their own, calling it Mandalore after their leader, Mandalore the First. The mythosaurs presented little challenge to the powerful Taung; in time, mythosaur bones were used to build Mandalore's first cities.</text>

In their travels, the early Republic explorers encountered many bizarre and fascinating species. Most of these first contacts were peaceful, but while charting worlds in the Outer Rim, scouts encountered enormous, flame-breathing reptiles known as Duinuogwuin. The terrified scouts opened fire and fled the planet, eventually returning to Coruscant--only to discover they'd been followed. The Duinuogwuin began waging war against the capital in what would be called the &quot;Duinuogwuin Contention.&quot;

Supreme Chancellor Fillorean, often criticized in the Senate for being hesitant and indecisive, ignored demands to mobilize the Republic Navy and attempted to communicate with the Duinuogwuin. To everyone's surprise, the Duinuogwuin were revealed to be intelligent and inherently peaceful. Supreme Chancellor Fillorean and the Duinuogwuin philosopher Borz'Mat'oh negotiated a treaty, and later even cooperated to found Coruscant's first university.</text>

During the boom period of early Republic expansion, dissent arose from the unlikeliest of quarters: the planet Alsakan. Colonized by the first explorers from Coruscant long before the development of the hyperdrive, Alsakan had been a member of the Core Worlds for centuries.

But as the planet grew more powerful and influential, its Senators believed that Alsakan, not Coruscant, should be the capital of the Republic. A series of skirmishes called the &quot;Alsakan Conflicts&quot; broke out, slowing Republic growth as it tried to quell Alsakan's forces.

Despite the best efforts of Republic diplomats and generals, Alsakan remained belligerent, and seventeen such uprisings would occur over the next several thousand years. Later, the battle cruisers built during the Alsakan Conflicts would inspire the Republic's Invincible-class dreadnought.</text>

In the period after the mysterious Architects vanished from the galaxy millennia ago, several great civilizations rose in their place. The intellectual Columi species created a vast but peaceful empire, focusing on academic pursuits while droids and elaborate machines labored for them. As a result, the Columi evolved enormous craniums and tiny bodies.

The strange, reptilian Kwa, who achieved interstellar travel through Infinity Gates that allowed them to effectively teleport between worlds, rose and mysteriously fell, eventually devolving into simple lizards. The cephalopod Gree also reached their apex in this time, creating technological marvels that have rarely been equaled.

In the millennia before the founding of the Republic, humans had not yet developed spaceflight. One human population--perhaps the only one--was confined to Coruscant, divided into thirteen tribes. This nearly proved disastrous when a volcanic eruption caused a near-extinction event, wiping out a large percentage of human life.

This made the humans easy prey for the Taung, a gray-skinned species that reveled in battle. Awed by the majesty of the eruption's ash cloud, the Taung took the name &quot;Warriors of the Shadow,&quot; descended on the surviving humans and subjugated them. Gradually the fighting force of the thirteen human tribes--known as the Battalions of Zhell--mustered a resistance against the Taung.

After years of struggle, the Battalions managed to repel the Taung and claim their freedom. Coruscant has been the seat of humanity ever since.</text>

After the Force Wars, when the Jedi Order learned of the destructive power of the dark side, the Jedi devoted themselves to the path of the light. In the early days of the Republic, a young Kashi Mer Jedi named Xendor defied the order's code and began experimenting with dark side techniques. Incensed, the Jedi Order confronted Xendor and banished him from Ossus.

Xendor, now immensely powerful and full of rage, raised an army on the planet Lettow and led it against the Jedi. Not since the Force Wars had the Jedi fought their own. Xendor and the Legions of Lettow eventually fell in battle; his lover, Arden Lyn, was defeated by the Jedi Master Awdrysta Pina and placed into a strange stasis, sustained by the dark side.

The Tionese Cluster, once a great civilization ruled by the despot Xim, entered its fading years as the Republic began its ascension. The third great power in the galaxy, the Hutt Empire, was also thriving. The Hutts used their criminal influence to control entire worlds, extorting and enslaving their subjects. Fear of the Hutts drove many worlds to seek membership in the Republic; truthfully, far more than the Republic could safely allow.

Eventually, war broke out between the Tion Cluster and the Republic. Despite--or because of--the Tionese's lack of resources, the Republic found them a dangerous foe. In response, Republic spies quietly stirred up trouble between the Tion Cluster and their old enemies, the Hutt Empire. 

Facing a war on two fronts, the Tionese submitted to the Republic. The worlds of the Tion Cluster gradually came under the Republic's banner, finally ending their long enmity.</text>

As the Core Worlds began to expand, another power in the Core was rising. The Tion Cluster, inhabited by the descendants of ancient sleeper ship crews, had developed a new hyperspace beacon technology based on fragments left by the Infinite Empire--far superior than the hyperspace cannons previously in use.

The Tion Cluster was gradually conquered by an arrogant and powerful pirate prince, known to history as the despot Xim. Using the new hyperspace technology, he despoiled world after world, taking slaves and ruthlessly expanding his territory. His rule of the Tion Cluster lasted for thirty years and saw the conquest of hundreds of thousands of planets.

Xim might have continued his rule unchallenged even longer, but he chose to expand his empire into a new area of space, one already inhabited by the powerful Hutt Empire.</text>

Seeking to expand his territory, the ancient Tionese despot Xim began exploring the Si'klaata Cluster--and for the first time, encountered a force that could challenge him. This region belonged to the Hutt Empire. Although young, the Hutt Empire had already grown immensely powerful through its criminal enterprises, helped by the long lifespan of the Hutts.

The Hutts correctly assessed the threat Xim presented and poured resources into fighting him near the planet Vontor. Despite their strength, the Hutts were not certain of victory until they discovered the Si'klaata Cluster was home to several other powerful species, including the Nikto, Klatooinians and Vodrans. In a typical gambit, the Hutts managed to persuade these three species to sign the Treaty of Vontor, which bound them to the Hutts in perpetual slavery.

With these additional forces, the Hutts overwhelmed Xim at the third Battle of Vontor. Xim died a Hutt prisoner, leaving his vast holdings and territory free for the taking.</text>

Devaronian males are as well-known for their wanderlust as their striking physical appearance; they possess brightly colored--often red--skin, sharp teeth and long cranial horns; these combined attributes often conjure images of deadly, malicious predators and elicit discomfort among non-Devaronians.

During the early days of the Sith Empire's return, Devaronians became targets of prejudice within outlying regions of Republic space, with less-educated citizens confusing the pureblood Sith and Devaronian biological traits.

Now the Evocii are enslaved, preserved only to serve their corpulent masters' whims. While a few brave Evocii actively oppose the Hutts' tyranny, most have resigned themselves to a life of servitude.

Often taken as mindless brutes, Houk are noteworthy for their strength and short tempers but can be surprisingly cunning; nonetheless, Houk prefer to solve problems with violence, and see no reason to be bound by treaties or contracts.  

Their natural strength and resilience means Houk gladiators are in high demand, especially for arena masters who can't afford a rare Wookiee combatant. A Houk named Torog became famous in the Besberra arena after fighting off waves of opponents and wild beasts for five hours, then dropping dead.

Their bodies average three meters in length, with large eyes and wide mouths offset by comparatively small upper appendages. Corpulence is a favored trait among Hutts, who believe that greater body mass indicates greater success and riches.

Although Hutts are biologically hermaphrodites, many take on the gender roles of other species; scientists and sociologists disagree on the reason for this. Hutts are also considered one of the longest-lived species in the galaxy, with several documented individuals living for more than one thousand years.

Culturally, Hutts favor entrepreneurial pursuits over direct action or labor. A vast number of these pursuits are based on illegal activities, with some Hutt clans constructing vast criminal empires that operate across numerous worlds for centuries at a time.</text>

Thanks to their imposing bone masks, Kaleesh are also highly sought-after as enforcers by status-conscious members of the criminal underworld. Wealthy Hutts employ Kaleesh bodyguards as a pointed warning to any upstarts who might challenge the Hutt Cartel's power.

Individual Kaleesh project a stoic fatalism mixed with a surprisingly deep spirituality. Their core belief is that those who perform great deeds in life become immortal, godlike beings upon their deaths. Kaleesh warriors therefore seek only the greatest challenges to overcome.

Over millennia, the conditions of their new colony led these Duros to evolve into a separate species: Neimoidians. These green-skinned, red-eyed beings grow from grubs in communal hives, where they spend the early years of their lives competing for food. Those who cannot find or steal enough to eat quickly starve, a process which ensures that weakness is weeded out early.

Personal greed is seen as acceptable and even desirable in Neimoidian culture, and while Neimoidians are known as capable entrepreneurs and administrators, their opponents paint them as deceitful, lazy cowards. Neimoidians do rely heavily on advanced droids for all but the most important tasks--freeing them to pursue elaborate political games for social rank or increased profits--but Neimoidian investors have also aided the Republic's economy in hard times. The Senate therefore tolerates Neimoidian bribe-taking and backroom trading... up to a point.</text>

Each evolved on the planet Kintan after a dying star, M'dweshuu, bombarded their world with radiation. A cult devoted to this star arose, and exerted a totalitarian hold on Nikto society until the Hutts discovered Kintan and destroyed the cult's stronghold in an orbital bombardment. The Nikto rallied to the Hutts under the Treaty of Vontor and the fortunes of the two species have been intertwined ever since. 

Nikto are gifted fighters, often serving as enforcers for the Hutts. Those who leave Kintan or the Hutt Cartel are often &quot;mixed-breeds&quot; who show characteristics of more than one subspecies and are subsequently reviled by their own people, but some are members of modern Nikto cults--often violent groups that trace their roots to the original Cult of M'dweshuu, for good or ill.</text>

Living in Gentes's thick atmosphere gives Ugnaughts some natural resistance to toxic gases, meaning they can work happily in industrial environments without protection.

The Ugnaughts' small size and impressive technical expertise unfortunately make them prime targets for slavers. The Hutt Cartel alone is responsible for displacing entire Ugnaught tribes, putting them to work in droid factories or to maintain the Hutts' extravagant palaces.</text>

Advozsec come from the geologically unstable Mid Rim world of Riflor, which has suffered groundquakes and volcanic eruptions throughout its history. Advozsec, therefore, often witness their cities' destruction by natural disasters, and have become accustomed to expecting the worst. 

Advozsec's distinctive black eyes allow them to cope with the high quantities of volcanic ash in Riflor's atmosphere, providing specialized tear ducts and excellent vision in low light. Riflor's ash also nourishes a surprisingly wide variety of plant life, allowing the strictly vegetarian Advozsec to enjoy a varied diet.

In the Republic, Advozsec are known as gifted starship engineers and reliable, if dour bureaucrats; to the Empire, their adaption to harsh environments--and cheap diet--make them appealing mercenaries and servants.</text>

Highly social, Arcona live in tight-knit nests where the needs of the group always come before those of the individual. This mentality is so ingrained that many Arcona alone in the galaxy still refer to themselves as &quot;we&quot; rather than &quot;I.&quot;</text>

Cathar are noteworthy hand-to-hand combatants, possessing retractable claws, strong physiques and natural agility.

It was the Cathar reputation for martial prowess that drew the Mandalorians to besiege their homeworld several centuries ago. Despite their valiant resistance against the remorseless invaders, the native Cathar were virtually exterminated. Out of millions, only a few hundred escaped the Mandalorians' attack and fled to Republic space.

In the time since their near-extinction, the Cathar have rebuilt their numbers to become common faces on Republic worlds. The Jedi Order, Galactic Senate and Republic military all claim numerous proud and loyal Cathar among their ranks. It is rare to encounter a Cathar who doesn't actively despise the Sith Empire--and especially its Mandalorian allies.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="205595" version="1065353216">Chagrians are amphibious beings with distinctive horns that evolved on the watery planet of Champala. Individual Chagrians are raised as tadpoles in pools of water within their family homes; upon gaining their adult forms, they retain the ability to breathe underwater but lose their sense of taste. Due to the unstable history of Champala's star, Chagrians also have a natural resistance to radiation.

Chagrian society is largely peaceful. Champala's government is famous for being even-handed, ensuring a high quality of life for all its citizens while showing special favor to none. This mentality is often borne out in Chagrian individuals; in Republic politics, Chagrians are often painted as naive idealists by their opponents, but they can be fiercely devoted to their constituents.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="205597" version="1065353216">Fierce creatures with an unrelenting hunger, Flesh Raiders are believed to be Tython's only sentient natives. They are at least partially intelligent, capable of building shelters and assembling basic weapons from scavenged technology, but attempts to communicate have all ended violently. Known for devouring their prisoners and any animals they come across, the Flesh Raiders were formerly content to live in their primitive, bone-strewn camps in the hills. More recently, the expansion of the Jedi and the defenseless Twi'lek Pilgrims seem to have drawn the Flesh Raiders into the valleys. 

No one knows where the Flesh Raiders came from. Some speculate they were once a civilized people, driven to cannibalism and madness over years of isolation. Others fear they are the result of dark side experiments. Whatever their origins, the Flesh Raiders have only grown more powerful and numerous over the years, and they are quickly becoming a blight on Tython.</text>

Their native language--which other species often find melodious but impossible to reproduce--resembles music rather than speech.

Ithorians are devoted environmentalists and staunch pacifists. They evolved on the beautiful jungle world of Ithor, eventually moving into floating &quot;herd ships&quot; to avoid disturbing the native flora they call &quot;Mother Jungle.&quot; Their experience building herd ships allowed the Ithorians to become one of the earliest spacefaring species, and they live on city-ships to this day. Every five years, Ithorians gather for a Meet, where they exchange news, debate important issues and come together as a culture.

Although not particularly technologically advanced, no species is more capable at restoring damaged ecologies than the Ithorians. Many Ithorian herds have begun visiting worlds whose biospheres were damaged in the Great War, encouraging the worlds' recovery or transplanting endangered flora and fauna to new homes.</text>

The combination of their alien appearance and strange technology leads unenlightened beings to naturally mistrust Kel Dor.

Thousands of years before they joined the Galactic Republic, Kel Dor developed their own Force-using order of &quot;Baran Do Sages.&quot; These men and women advised rich and powerful families, using the Force to guide their patrons to strength and prosperity. However, the Baran Do Sages faded into obscurity once the Jedi took over training the Force-sensitive Kel Dor.

Kel Dor inhabit all walks of Republic life, from powerful Jedi Masters to lowlife bounty hunters. Culturally, they tend to view life in black-and-white terms. Kel Dor aren't above acts of vigilantism, meting out personal justice if they believe a grievance warrants it.</text>

Many famous inventors, artists, military leaders and Jedi have emerged from this people. Less noble-minded Mon Calamari have made equally successful criminals and gangsters.

Physically, Mon Calamari possess dome-like heads, large eyes and long webbed hands. They are fast swimmers who can hold their breath for long periods, although wounded or panicked Mon Calamari are still capable of drowning. Their eyes can swivel independently, allowing them to focus on two different areas simultaneously.

Despite only joining the Republic within the last millennia, Mon Calamari have earned a reputation for being its most enthusiastic supporters. Folk wisdom says that when a Mon Calamari joins a cause, its eventual victory is assured. Although they are not a warlike race by nature, Mon Calamari are more than willing to fight for ideals they believe in.</text>

Their harsh and unforgiving natural habitat has shaped Rodians into an aggressively survivalist culture. A reputation for violent tendencies has pushed Rodians to the fringes of galactic society, as few other species trust them.

The most noteworthy physical feature of Rodians is their large, multifaceted eyes, which allow them to detect another creature's body heat even in near-total darkness. This gives Rodians a natural edge as hunters, leading many to pursue careers as bounty hunters or even less-savory professions.

The negative stereotyping of Rodians is mostly unearned, however. Many among the species have channeled their biological adaptations and cultural inclinations toward more productive paths. Rodians serve proudly in the Republic military and Jedi Order, standing united with humans and other species to oppose the Sith Empire.</text>

These physical adaptations were required for Togrutas to endure and to hunt on their homeworld of Shili, which is dominated by large and deadly beasts. Togruta culture is tightly knit out of necessity, as individual survival there often depended on tribal unity.

Because of their ingrained affinity for teamwork and togetherness, Togrutas are among the Republic's most loyal and dependable citizens. Indeed, a higher-than-normal percentage of Togrutas exhibit powerful Force sensitivity and serve in the Jedi Order. Some scholars speculate that the Togrutas' unique sensory adaptations and strong cultural bonds makes them more receptive to learning the ways of the Jedi.</text>

Their culture revolves around combat and belief in an all-knowing goddess called the Scorekeeper who grants &quot;Jagannath points&quot; for honorable kills. These points denote an individual's status in Trandoshan society and purportedly determine a Trandoshan's eventual fate in the afterlife; consequently, even outside of physical combat, Trandoshan society is extremely competitive.

Trandoshans share their native star system with the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk, and the two species have a long and vicious history together. Trandoshans see the wildlife of Kashyyyk--including the Wookiees themselves--as choice prey, and the Wookiees readily and violently defend their beloved home from raids by Trandoshan hunters and slavers.</text>

Excellent instincts and a natural talent for leadership helped Tavus rise quickly through the ranks, but he has repeatedly refused any assignment that would take him away from combat. Instead, he earned a place in the Republic's famed Havoc Squad, serving as the team's commanding officer.

Tavus is widely respected for his dedication to the soldiers under his command, so much so that he is rarely referred to by his official rank of captain; instead, Tavus is called merely &quot;commander,&quot; an old Republic Army tradition designating him as someone whose authority and skill supersedes any specific rank.</text>

Anyone unlucky enough to cross Rogun the Butcher should measure his or her future lifespan in days; this gangster comes by his nickname honestly, having left a trail of bodies from one end of the galaxy to the other--with no end in sight.</text>

His business partners are disposable assets, and friends are only a means to an end.

Skavak's sole loyalty is to himself, and he'll take jobs from anyone if it will line his pockets with a few more credits.

Despite the total secrecy of Havoc's missions, the team has taken on an almost superhuman reputation on both sides of the war--unstoppable commandos who can strike anytime, anywhere, regardless of opposition.

Before Special Forces existed as a separate division of its own, Havoc Squad was attached to a standard infantry division throughout the Great War. It wasn't until the Battle of Alderaan that the squad rose to galactic fame, leading a small group of wounded and recovering men to victory against a massive Imperial invasion force. 

The value of small elite units had been proven, and Havoc Squad was later chosen as the model for a full division of highly trained and agile infantry squads--the Republic Special Forces.</text>

Unlike most army divisions, Special Forces is composed almost entirely of small squads of elite, highly trained soldiers specializing in irregular warfare. 

Relying on high mobility, extensive training and the latest military technologies, SpecForce squads exploit weaknesses that larger forces can't, giving the Republic military greater flexibility in addressing enemy threats. Standard assignments include reconnaissance, sabotage, asset recovery (enemy or friendly, personnel or materiel), search and destroy operations, and training and support for allied personnel.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="209244" version="1065353216">It's a fact of life: Whenever uptight governments forbid certain goods on their worlds, demand for these items increases. Once demand turns profitable, enterprising starship captains risk everything to deliver the goods in question.

Careers in smuggling are fast-paced, thrilling and often short-lived. Running contraband not only places a smuggler at odds with a planet's law enforcement, but its criminal elements as well. Pirates, gangsters, revolutionaries and bounty hunters are just a few of the hazards standing between a smuggler and that big payday. Only those who possess the sharpest instincts, sturdiest freighters and quickest blasters live long enough to earn a good living at this game.

It's worth noting that not all smugglers are profiteers. Some style themselves as heroic blockade runners or patriotic privateers, delivering hope and much-needed supplies to those who need it. Of course, that's also exactly how the real criminal types describe themselves, and law enforcement officers rarely accept &quot;I was serving a noble cause&quot; as an excuse.</text>

Those who remain loyal to the Republic flock to places like Fort Garnik seeking food and shelter. Sadly, there are only so many supplies to go around.

The small shantytowns outside Fort Garnik overflow with impoverished people running out of options. As food, medicine and other basic necessities dwindle to nothing, these refugees resort to desperate measures for survival. Crime and exploitation run rampant, with refugees frequently turning against each other over a half-eaten nutripaste stick.</text>

While this attitude is not entirely unwarranted, certain fringe groups believed their world's entire government was little more than a kleptocracy. These activists routinely protested outside government offices, demanding the elected officials be brought to justice.

For a long time, the fringe groups were dismissed as delusional, paranoid or simply troublemakers. It wasn't until an entire governmental cabinet was forced to step down for accepting bribes that ordinary citizens began taking the corruption claims seriously. This was the birth of the separatist movement.</text>

The planet's unstable political situation is a bitterly divisive subject, with separatist sympathizers and government loyalists increasingly polarized about how to end the conflict. Some families have been irreparably torn apart when one child joined the separatist movement and another enlisted in the government-backed military. 

The separatists remain fanatically committed to their cause, demonstrating no willingness to negotiate or settle matters peacefully. The Ord Mantellian government has summoned the Republic military to bolster the planet's defenses and put down the rebellion quickly for the good of all. Leaders are pessimistic that the separatists will ever surrender.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="209250" version="1065353216">Ord Mantell was once considered a vital supply depot for the Republic military, but the discovery of new hyperspace lanes virtually eradicated the need to route fleets through the planet's local star cluster. The ordnance engineers and military families formerly occupying the planet transferred to distant outposts, and Ord Mantell was abandoned to farmers.

The old military-grade spaceports were never decommissioned, however, and it didn't take long for private interests to take them over. In addition to corporations like Czerka, less savory factions from the galactic underworld set up shop. Small-time criminal gangs took advantage of the planet's lack of strong Republic oversight and became thriving operations.

These gangsters and corporations have invested heavily in the world's government. Many of Ord Mantell's major political figures are indebted to their corporate and underworld &quot;sponsors,&quot; and although some of these leaders have left office in disgrace, it has not discouraged the wealthy and unscrupulous from purchasing political influence. Other politicians have pledged to clean up corruption--rarely succeeding for long, despite noble intentions.</text>

Avilatan was a haven for gangsters, smugglers and pirates, but was also one of the largest and most thriving economies on Ord Mantell. Settlements formed, and over decades, Avilatan became respected as a major commerce center.

When separatist bombings destroyed Ord Mantell's other spaceports, Avilatan became the Republic military's primary staging area, and its now-substantial landing zone took on strategic importance. Renaming the Avilatan spaceport to &quot;Fort Garnik&quot; in honor of a Republic war hero from Ord Mantell, the military established a fortified garrison there. Since then, Avilatan Island and Fort Garnik have become major targets of the separatist forces.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="209254" version="1065353216">The separatist command center closest to Fort Garnik was originally thought to be Mannett Point, but Republic intelligence operatives recently discovered that the main separatist force occupies the island's still-active volcano. This position gives the separatists multiple access points to the island's settlements, as well as a predator's eye view of Fort Garnik itself.

Sources indicate the volcano base originally belonged to a notorious gangster known only as &quot;the Corellian&quot; who disappeared in the civil war's early years. Whether the Corellian joined the separatists or gave them his volcano base under duress is anyone's guess. Regardless, taking out the separatist stronghold has proven almost impossible. Any attack on foot exposes the invading force to withering counterattacks and heavy casualties, but artillery strikes on the volcano risk flooding the entire island with lava.</text>

Yuon once taught the history of Jedi philosophy at the temple, but in recent years she has returned to working in the field.

Yuon's search for lost Jedi ruins and artifacts has brought her into contact with dozens of different cultures.

Earning &quot;Jagannath points&quot; with every honorable kill, Qyzen has traveled for years, seeking worthy prey and honoring his goddess, the Scorekeeper. Although his travels have brought him to Tython several times, he is never seen by the Jedi if Yuon Par is not at the temple. 

Despite his disdain of fame and fortune, Qyzen has attracted some notoriety. He often slips through apparently watertight Imperial borders to follow his prey, much to the consternation of the Empire's officials. Qyzen is also the only living hunter to have killed a greater crested gundark, thought extinct for centuries. His simple habits and devotion to the Scorekeeper give him common ground with the Jedi, though many disapprove of the attitudes and instincts that come naturally to a Trandoshan.

Now considered a maverick among his peers, Orgus prefers to leave meditation, debate and diplomacy to the Jedi Council while he goes out and gets things done.

Despite his sometimes abrasive nature, there are many among the order who respect Orgus as a man of action.

After the destruction of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, Satele Shan embarked on a search to rediscover the lost world. Guided by the Force, she ventured into the Deep Core and re-emerged with astrogation charts detailing a new series of stable hyperspace lanes. Tython was once again connected to the rest of the galaxy.

Initial exploration of the planet took months, as Jedi scouts combed the surface for clues to Tython's history. Lives were lost--to a troubled landscape, to the Flesh Raiders and to forces unknown--but soon, the Jedi Council established a new temple on the world, determined to rebuild Tython and return it to humble glory.</text>

With their temple looted and in ruins and relations with the Republic government at a new low, the Jedi left the Republic capital to establish a new temple on the rediscovered world of Tython--the homeworld of the first Jedi.

By returning to their ancestral home, the Jedi hoped to reconnect with the beliefs and ideals of those who founded the order twenty millennia ago. They sought to reclaim forgotten knowledge and wisdom left behind by ancient Masters, scouring the planet for holocrons and Jedi artifacts to replace those that had been lost during the destruction of the temple on Coruscant. They began training a new generation of students and began to mend relations with those who blamed the Jedi for the destruction of the war.

On Tython, many young Jedi believe they have rediscovered the original purpose of their order: to stand firm against the servants of the dark side. Removed from the machinations and concessions of politicians and bureaucrats, the Jedi have once again become beacons in the eternal struggle between light and dark.</text>

Some are &quot;merely&quot; repositories of incredible lore, while others possess virtual personalities of their own, modeled after their creators.

Many believe it was actually the Sith who first developed holocron technology, as the oldest known examples are all relics of the dark side. Interestingly, Jedi holocrons take the form of a glowing cube, while Sith holocrons are usually pyramid-shaped. Some scholars claim the six-sided cube of the Jedi represents a more modern and advanced version of the original four- and five-sided pyramids favored by the Sith, though hard evidence for this idea is scarce.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="209332" version="1065353216">The lightsaber is the iconic symbol of the Jedi. Through the Force, it becomes an extension of the wielder; serving as both a powerful tool for defense and a devastating weapon against the dark side. Padawans, however, typically use electroblade training swords until they have proven themselves worthy. Only then can a Padawan make a pilgrimage to the Forge on Tython to construct a lightsaber in accordance with ancient Jedi traditions.

Lightsabers come in both single- and double-bladed forms, and their blades can be a variety of colors. Blue, green and yellow are the most common among the Jedi, though there are examples of other hues such as magenta and cyan. The color of a given lightsaber's blade is largely determined by the crystals in the hilt that power the weapon. Different crystals confer varying properties on the weapon, allowing each lightsaber to be customized by its creator.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="209346" version="1065353216">The Forge</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="209346" version="1065353216">Since the rebuilding of the temple, the very best of the young Jedi have braved the paths through the mountains, hoping to make their first lightsabers at the monument known as the Forge--the ancient Tythonians' site for creating or mending weapons. When the Jedi returned to Tython, they had only scraps of information on the Forge's location; it took ten months before a small team finally discovered it, overgrown by vines and half-buried by a landslide.   

Despite the Forge's power, many Jedi have sensed a strange darkness or corruption in the region surrounding the Forge. The local beasts are unusually vicious, and the weather often changes without warning. These phenomena mean only the most skilled and combat-ready Padawans are encouraged to seek out the Forge.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="209355" version="1065353216">Tythos Ridge</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="209355" version="1065353216">The primitive Flesh Raiders have turned the once-lush mountains of Tythos Ridge into a horrific camp from which to launch their raids on the other denizens of Tython. The ground is black and barren; the trees and foliage burned away. The air is thick with the stench of death, and piles of bones desecrate ancient Tythonian pillars, mute testament to the countless victims of the Flesh Raiders' appetites.

Tythos Ridge was never fully studied during the early stages of Tython's Jedi reoccupation; Master Bestros proposed its use as a meditation retreat, but since then, the increasing number of Flesh Raiders has made exploration impossible. It is unclear whether a small Flesh Raider village was the seed for this now-vast settlement, or whether the Flesh Raiders migrated to the ridge en masse--but either way, for Jedi Masters seeking to understand the creatures, further reconnaissance of the ridge is an absolute necessity.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="209359" version="1065353216">Ruins of Kaleth</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="209359" version="1065353216">Crumbling walls and rubble are all that remain of the fortified city of Kaleth. Carvings at Kaleth suggest the site has been inhabited and abandoned more than once over the millennia--but always by Force users. This has given rise to dozens of theories about Kaleth from scholars at the Jedi Temple, not to mention interest from archaeologists seeking artifacts of the ancient Jedi. Unfortunately, exploration of Kaleth is hampered by ancient hostile droids that still roam the ruins. 

The presence of these droids, the discovery of surviving computers and reports of strange lights at night prove Kaleth still has sections with functioning power despite being abandoned for centuries. Because of this, some members of the first expedition to Tython recommended restoring Kaleth and making it the new settlement of the Jedi Order. The Jedi Council decided against this, however, preferring to study Kaleth and its history from a distance.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="209366" version="1065353216">The Chamber of Speech</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="209366" version="1065353216">The Chamber of Speech is mentioned several times in surviving histories of Kaleth, though only in passing. The scrolls Jedi Knight Do Zonn obtained suggest the chamber was a repository of knowledge in some form, and reference a mysterious being who was master of the chamber's lore. 

Attempts to fully examine the old machines in the Chamber of Speech have proved fruitless, as the battle droids that guard the ruin are particularly violent. There is evidence that the droids were programmed to return to the chamber if its other defenses failed. Whatever secrets the chamber hides, the ancients of Kaleth were careful to protect them.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="212707" version="1065353216">Kalikori Village</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="212707" version="1065353216">Named after an old Twi'lek word for &quot;beginning,&quot; Kalikori village is a settlement in the Tythonian hills, founded by a group of Twi'lek Pilgrims fleeing persecution. The Pilgrims asked the Republic for permission to settle on Tython but were refused; defying the ruling, the Pilgrims founded a small camp that gradually grew into Kalikori village. The village Matriarch's home is built on the site of the original landing.

Kalikori is technically an illegal settlement, without protection under Republic law. As the village grew, boasting fertile fields and its own irrigation system, the Twi'lek Pilgrims realized they were expanding into Flesh Raider territory and have been fighting off the creatures ever since without outside help. Despite the anger of the villagers at the Jedi who have &quot;abandoned&quot; them, many Padawans travel to Kalikori village to seek the Matriarch's blessing or to learn about the Pilgrims' teachings.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="218211" version="1065353216">Twi'lek</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="218211" version="1065353216">Twi'leks are a humanoid species with long, prehensile head-tails called lekku--organs housing sections of the Twi'lek brain and specialized for communication through subtle motion. Twi'leks are native to the harsh world of Ryloth, a planet that has suffered from occupation by the Hutt Cartel in recent years; Twi'leks on Ryloth not forced to work in the mines are often taken as slaves, exported to markets throughout the Outer Rim.

Millennia of dispersion into the wider galaxy, however, means that many Twi'leks have little or no sense of connection with their beleaguered homeworld; Twi'leks may be second only to humans in their ubiquity throughout known space. Nonetheless, many Twi'leks can't escape the shadows of slavery and the underworld--often, they find work with the same pirates, slavers and spice dealers who have traditionally oppressed their species.

Twi'lek names vary dramatically, depending on whether the parents follow the old Twi'lek tradition of combining given and family name, or use the more common approach (separating first name and surname) used by many other species. Some Twi'leks eschew any surname altogether.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="218215" version="1065353216">Zabrak</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="218215" version="1065353216">Zabrak are near-human sentients from the planet Iridonia renowned for their independence and wandering spirit. They have distinctive facial horns, whose number and pattern denote which subspecies an individual Zabrak belongs to. Most Zabrak wear ritual facial tattoos, which vary from simple lines to more elaborate patterns. The designs can mark significant events in their lives, or merely be a matter of personal preference.

After discovering space travel early in their civilization, they quickly colonized worlds throughout the Mid Rim and gained a reputation as pioneers and explorers. Zabrak are also skilled warriors, engaging in inter-clan competitions to hone their talents; their physiology, which includes a secondary heart and some resistance to pain, gives them surprising endurance in battle.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="218220" version="1065353216">Tythonian War Droid</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="218220" version="1065353216">The ruins of Kaleth are overrun with various squads of ancient--and hostile--war droids. A deadly remnant of Tython's mysterious past, the original purpose of the droids has been lost in the mists of time.  Some speculate they were once guardians, programmed to protect the powerful secrets of Tython's original Jedi inhabitants. Others believe the droids were used for combat training by the order shortly after the creation of the first proto-lightsaber. A more sinister theory suggests the droids were somehow involved in the destruction of Kaleth itself. Whatever the explanation, one fact is not in dispute: The droids will attack any living creature that dares to enter the territory they still fiercely patrol.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="218387" version="1065353216">Rumored to be the descendant of a Corellian noble family, Syo Bakarn distinguished himself as a Padawan by saving his master from a Mandalorian Jedi hunter. Syo was part of the delegation at the original Jedi Temple when the Sacking of Coruscant occurred. 

Syo has represented the Jedi Council on several diplomatic missions and spoken for the order before the Republic Senate. In addition to his duties for the Council, Syo is also a talented engineer, responsible for the rebuilt Jedi Archives and many of the systems within the Jedi Temple on Tython.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="218399" version="1065353216">The Principles of Rajivari (Consular)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="218399" version="1065353216">Master Rajivari's surviving ideas have been the subject of much debate by Jedi scholars, and the records left by his apprentices give new insight into Rajivari's philosophy. His second principle, &quot;all life is a battle, even to the last breath&quot; appears to be an extreme interpretation of the natural survival instincts all beings share. The seventh principle, &quot;to sacrifice strength is the act of a fool&quot; is a clear attempt to break from Jedi teachings, which view self-sacrifice, especially in the service of others, as one of the noblest actions a Jedi can take. 

Rajivari's fifth principle, &quot;mercy creates a spiral of destruction,&quot; is the most controversial. Jedi are encouraged to take the merciful path wherever possible. However, it can be argued that if a Jedi shows mercy to those who don't comprehend it--such as violent predators--this may cause greater harm in the future.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219001" version="1065353216">Drelliad Village</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219001" version="1065353216">What is now called Drelliad village was established decades ago as the private retreat of Ord Mantell's most celebrated smuggler, the voluptuous and quick-witted Ulla Drelliad. In the years after Ulla's death, her hideaway was transformed into a thriving trading post. Now, Drelliad village is hotly contested territory where separatist and Republic forces battle in the streets, and the handful of civilians who haven't already fled hide in basements and behind locked doors.

Although small, Drelliad village occupies a critical point between separatist-controlled territory and areas still loyal to the Republic. More importantly, what used to be Ulla's personal docking bay is now one of the only starship landing pads outside of local Republic headquarters. If Drelliad village falls entirely to the separatists, it will bring the enemy one step closer to securing the entire island.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219002" version="1065353216">Talloran Village</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219002" version="1065353216">One of the few settlements around Fort Garnik not originally founded by criminals, Talloran village began as home to the laborers and their families who toiled in the island's starship ports and shipping warehouses. The people of Talloran were hardworking, mostly poor and easily exploited by the corrupt businessmen in charge of Ord Mantell's government.

When the separatists came to the island, Talloran was the first village they infiltrated. The people, long oppressed by the existing power structure, were ready to side with anyone who offered them a way out. Ironically, siding with the separatists only got the workers trapped inside their village as the Republic laid siege to the enemy occupation.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219003" version="1065353216">Oradam Village</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219003" version="1065353216">In contrast to the working-class origins of Talloran village, Oradam was a beachfront paradise for wealthy trader-barons and their families. These men and women spent their profits constructing elaborate homes and relaxing by the sea. Their freely flowing credits attracted numerous merchants and artisans to Oradam, many of whom remained long after their wealthy patrons fled.

Oradam is the last uncontested Republic village on the island of Avilatan, partially because it holds very little strategic significance. Its importance to the separatists is mostly symbolic. Republic strategists theorize that if the encroaching separatists were to successfully invade Oradam, the enemy would most likely burn the village to the ground as a way of spiting the corrupt upper class.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219215" version="1065353216">Imperial Listening Post (Knight)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219215" version="1065353216">Republic intelligence operatives traced a coded Imperial transmission to a hidden outpost on Ord Mantell. It appears the Empire has been operating this spy base for years, taking advantage of the planet's civil war to mask its presence.

The listening post is buried underneath a small islet a short distance from Fort Garnik, virtually on the Republic's doorstep. SIS tacticians are now re-evaluating military strategy on Ord Mantell in light of this discovery. If the Empire has been observing Republic troop movements in the area, there's no telling what they may have told the Mantellian separatists.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219394" version="1065353216">Admission to the Sith Academy</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219394" version="1065353216">It has always been a privilege to face the trials at the Sith Academy. Even though most acolytes fail--and the cost of failure is typically death--the chance to train in the dark arts and become one of the most powerful beings in the galaxy is incentive enough for most. Others, attuned to the Force but reluctant to participate, are dragged and forced to face the trials.

Until recently, only purebloods and humans from the Empire were allowed entrance. To produce a Sith child is one of the Empire's highest honors, and families identify and groom potential candidates from an early age. Since the loss of so many Sith in the war, however, a swell of less traditional thinking has opened the Academy to anyone displaying Force sensitivity.

Some conservative Sith call this a foolish and desperate move that will dilute the order instead of returning it to strength; others accept it as a temporary measure. At first, the conflict was merely intellectual as the first waves of new recruits into the Academy died ingloriously--but things are changing, and the new breed of Sith may yet prove itself worthy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219395" version="1065353216">Legacy of Tulak Hord</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219395" version="1065353216">The secrets behind Tulak Hord's great power were many, and they all but vanished from the galaxy with the Dark Lord's death. Generations of Sith have obsessed over unearthing his ancient teachings and artifacts, but Tulak Hord hid them well.

Of the relics recovered successfully, the mask of Tulak Hord is most recognizable. Darth Revan discovered this relic in Tulak Hord's tomb while searching for the Star Forge space station, though both the mask of Tulak Hord and the mask of Darth Revan have disappeared since. In recent years, Tulak Hord's lightsaber was unearthed on Dromund Fels by Darth Marr before his ascension to the Dark Council.

Despite these discoveries, Tulak Hord's greatest treasures still lie locked away in the far corners of the galaxy, waiting for a new master to claim their power.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219396" version="1065353216">Sith Titles</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219396" version="1065353216">The Sith Order bestows a number of titles upon its followers, as befits their rank and power. These are the most common:

Acolyte: A Sith acolyte has not yet completed his or her trials in the Sith Academy, and may well die before becoming truly &quot;Sith.&quot;

Sith: An acolyte who completes the trials and is accepted as the apprentice of a Sith Lord is considered Sith--no more, no less. Any non-Sith, however, is expected to refer to a Sith as &quot;my lord&quot; out of respect.

Overseer: An instructor at the Sith Academy is called an overseer. Overseers are often Sith Lords, but that rank is not a requirement; they may simply be Sith with a talent for instruction.

Sith Lord: A Sith who advances in the order's hierarchy will eventually be elevated to Sith Lord. His or her name is preceded by &quot;Lord&quot; in formal address. In the modern Empire, &quot;Dark Lord&quot; is synonymous with this term.

Darth: The strongest Sith Lords ascend to the position of Darth. Many take a new name at this point, symbolically embracing their transformation into something greater. 

Emperor: There has been only one Sith Emperor since the Great Hyperspace War over 1,300 years ago. He is supreme.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219397" version="1065353216">Sith Weapons</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219397" version="1065353216">The most visible symbol of the Sith is their iconic weapon: the lightsaber. Lightsabers are powered through a combination of rare crystals, precise engineering and the Force itself. They come in both single- and double-bladed forms, and the Sith are believed to be the first to wield the double-blade. While a lightsaber hilt is often customized by its owner, the blade's color is determined by its crystal; red, purple and orange are the most common colors among the Sith, though other colors, such as magenta and cyan, are known to exist.

Acolytes seeking to wield these weapons are required to begin their trials using an electroblade training sword, an unwieldy device designed to cause painful shocks to the target. If an acolyte is found worthy, he may hone his abilities with an ancient Sith warblade--a weapon used in an era before lightsabers, crafted by pureblooded artisans. In the end, only the strongest and deadliest acolytes may earn a lightsaber for themselves, seizing one from a failed Sith or Jedi or uncovering it in the depths of a tomb.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219398" version="1065353216">Slavery in the Empire</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219398" version="1065353216">In contrast with the Republic, which officially condemns the practice, slavery is widely accepted across the Empire. However, instead of slaves being bought and sold merely on an individual basis, the custom has been fully incorporated into the hierarchy of Imperial society. As the lowest caste, slaves perform menial duties and backbreaking labor, and they possess virtually no rights or recourse under the law.

The ranks of slaves are typically made up of those who fall outside the traditional Imperial power structure: prisoners of war, criminals and aliens from conquered worlds. Children of slaves are born into the same caste as their parents, though it is possible for individuals to be elevated should they show strength and ability that would better serve the Empire in a more distinguished role.

Recently--seeking to replenish the ranks of the Sith Order after the war--even the Sith Academy has started accepting slaves who show a strong affinity for the Force... though many still look on these former slaves with disdain.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219405" version="1065353216">Khem Val (Inquisitor)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219405" version="1065353216">Once a loyal servant of the Sith Lord Tulak Hord, Khem Val was placed in a stasis chamber in the tomb of Naga Sadow centuries ago by his master for safekeeping. Tulak Hord is long dead, but Khem Val lives on; a terrifying nightmare from the ancient past. 

Powerful, cunning and ruthless enough to slay even the strongest Force users, Khem Val was trained as an elite assassin. After emerging from his long slumber, the Dashade is the very embodiment of death and destruction; a reminder that there are things even Sith and Jedi must fear. 

Although once pledged to a life of service, with his original master gone, it is uncertain where Khem Val's true loyalties now lie. A near-perfect killing machine, he could prove a valuable weapon for anyone willing to take him on... though he is a weapon that can cut both ways.

Likes: Killing Force users, displays of strength, making foolish people unhappy
Dislikes: Weakness in any form, not killing Force users

Primary Weapon: Vibrosword</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219407" version="1065353216">Overseer Harkun (Inquisitor)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219407" version="1065353216">A gruff, hard-line traditionalist, Overseer Harkun believes in the Empire and the superiority of its children. He makes no effort to hide his contempt for acolytes who have risen up from slavery or those chosen from alien cultures. His stubborn rejection of the changes at the Academy--of the need to replace Sith lost in the war with a new and &quot;lesser&quot; generation--has crippled his prospects for advancement, leaving him bitter and spiteful... particularly to those students who represent what he most despises.

Harkun is well aware that his days are numbered. Yet he is determined to exact his revenge on those acolytes unfortunate enough to be placed under his supervision. If he can't keep the fools of the galaxy from joining the Academy, at least he can make them suffer.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219408" version="1065353216">Lord Zash (Inquisitor)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219408" version="1065353216">Energetic and excitable, Lord Zash has devoted her life to researching the arts of the Sith. An expert in manipulating the dark side of the Force, she eschews the ostentation and pretentiousness common to instructors at the Academy on Korriban.

Many students are initially taken aback, both by her appearance and her demeanor. Scholarly--even bookish--she also seems young for one who has risen so high in the Academy's ranks. Instead of instructing through fear and intimidation, she is quick to offer encouragement or a helping hand to acolytes who show promise.

But on Korriban, only the cunning and the strong survive. There is more to Zash than meets the eye, and those who underestimate her rarely live to regret their mistake.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219409" version="1065353216">Overseer Tremel (Warrior)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219409" version="1065353216">A long-tenured administrator of the trials at the Sith Academy, Overseer Tremel is the latest in a family line that has guarded the gateway to becoming Sith for centuries--first on the Imperial homeworld of Dromund Kaas, and more recently on the reclaimed Sith holy world of Korriban.

A staunch traditionalist, Tremel is fervently opposed to the recent mandate allowing any Force-sensitive individual--regardless of heritage or background--to face the trials. He believes it to be a great threat that must be stamped out and will stop at nothing to weed out the impure and unworthy--even if it means defying his superiors.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219411" version="1065353216">Vette (Warrior)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219411" version="1065353216">A Twi'lek born into slavery on the planet Ryloth, Vette escaped a life of servitude to become an accomplished rogue and treasure hunter. Too daring for her own good, she managed to breach Imperial defenses and sneak onto Korriban, gaining entry into the most sacred Sith tombs before being caught.

Years of travel and close calls have made Vette quick with a blaster. Outspoken, uppity and unfiltered, she can be fiercely loyal or relentlessly taxing, making her a source of annoyance to some and of great amusement to others.

Likes: Anti-authority behavior, protecting the weak, treasure and getting paid
Dislikes: Bullying, killing innocents, kissing up

Primary Weapon: Dual Blaster Pistols</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219412" version="1065353216">Darth Baras (Warrior)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219412" version="1065353216">Entrusted by the Emperor and the Dark Council to oversee the negotiations leading to the Treaty of Coruscant, Darth Baras has long held sway within the highest layers of the Sith Order. His power base of secret spies and well-placed minions stretches across the galaxy, enabling him to orchestrate and manipulate events from the shadows.

He is a man of great vision, and it is even said that the Force grants him glimpses of disturbances yet to come. Methodical and calculating, Baras is a true master of the dark arts, and some say the future of the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219414" version="1065353216">The Beast of Marka Ragnos (Warrior)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219414" version="1065353216">Left to guard the tomb serving as the resting place for its master, Marka Ragnos, the beast has dwelled in darkness for centuries. Legend tells that Ragnos beat his pet nightly, warping it with the Force until it was a creature of pure hate and anguish. Starved for unthinkable periods of time and then fed only blood, it is said to be filled with an unquenchable thirst for more.

Since the death of its master and its seclusion in the tomb, no one has seen the beast and lived to tell the tale. But the strongest Sith can feel its unnerving presence.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219441" version="1065353216">Braden (Bounty Hunter)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219441" version="1065353216">Braden's long and storied career has never quite reached the heights of notoriety it deserved. For more than twenty-five years, Braden has claimed hundreds of bounties for clients ranging from the infamous crime lord Nok Drayen to generals in the Republic military and Jedi Masters with no one else to turn to.

With his glory days behind him and his career in decline, Braden is looking for one last chance to shine before passing the torch to a new generation of hunters and retiring in some quiet corner of the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219443" version="1065353216">Tarro Blood (Bounty Hunter)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219443" version="1065353216">The son of Alderaanian nobility, Tarro Blood renounced his privileged existence as the heir to a minor lordship in favor of pursuing greater glory and fame as a galaxy-renowned Mandalorian mercenary.

Leaving his past behind and taking on a new dramatic moniker, Blood was able to prove that he was no pretender after years of training under a famed Mandalorian champion. Under the guidance of this exceptional tutor, Blood became a feared warrior and the favorite to claim victory in the next Great Hunt.

Unfortunately, Tarro Blood's characteristic arrogance and sudden rise to prominence rubbed his competition the wrong way. The other Mandalorians in the competition made it their mission to ensure that he never came close to claiming victory. The resulting defeat nearly cost Blood his life, in addition to his pride, and he has remained away from the public eye for nearly a decade.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219444" version="1065353216">Mako (Bounty Hunter)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219444" version="1065353216">At first glance, Mako's relationship with Braden seems more like that of a father and daughter than members of a team of professional bounty hunters--and that assessment wouldn't be too far off the mark. 

Orphaned and homeless but with an uncanny instinct for computing, Mako had been living as a freelance slicer in the shadows of Nar Shaddaa's underbelly... until the day Braden pulled the girl bleeding out of an alley, and paid a street surgeon to patch her blaster burns.

Recognizing talent and trouble when he saw it, Braden took Mako under his wing and has been looking after her as his own ever since. But while Mako loves the old man more than anything, her independent nature is beginning to chafe under Braden's protectiveness.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219447" version="1065353216">Name: Kaliyo Djannis
Gender: Female
Species: Rattataki
Age: 29 (unconfirmed)
Likes: Disrespecting authority, casual violence, anarchy for the fun of it
Dislikes: Self-sacrifice for the greater good, sincerity, obedience, patriotic spirit and being taken advantage of

Primary Weapon: Sniper Rifle and Blaster Rifle

Background (Summary): Multiple contradictory accounts make full background assessment difficult. Subject likely born on Rattatak. Escaped homeworld at a young age. Proceeded to find employment as freelance enforcer and assassin for major criminal syndicates (Exchange, Hutt Cartel) and individual underworld figures (Rholl). Persistent links to Brentaal Four anarchist cells (see Revolutionary Edge Brigade). Minimal activity within Imperial borders.

Personality: Kaliyo Djannis prizes her freedom and will lie, murder and blackmail in order to ensure that she is in control of a situation and able to indulge her vices. Known to pursue lengthy vendettas to redress grievances. Possesses a track record of expertly manipulating employers, lovers and associates (agents should not be fooled by attempts at seduction). As with many mercenaries, her loyalty cannot be purchased, but her services can be--if only temporarily.

Notes: No known military training, but extremely capable with assault weapons. Has been known to bite when disarmed.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219448" version="1065353216">Alias: The Red Blade
Gender: Unknown
Species: Unknown
Age: Unknown

Background (Summary): Mysterious pirate known to operate along the Ison Corridor trade route in the Outer Rim. Typically assaults and pillages mid-size trade vessels with military escorts. Regularly docks at underworld havens (Port Nowhere, Wild Byth's) to refuel, sell off cargo and celebrate accomplishments. Rarely emerges from ship or private suites during celebrations.

Personality: The Red Blade is brutal during raids, rarely leaving survivors. Despite the pirate's obvious caution, we believe the Red Blade's identity isn't entirely secret--he or she has been present during raucous parties and gatherings at several pirate bases--but rather, revealed only to trusted associates and otherwise protected through obscurity.

Notes: Although the Red Blade identity is suitable for undercover operations in Hutt Space, do not attempt to operate under this alias near the Ison Corridor.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219453" version="1065353216">The facilities at the Old Muckworks process the enormous quantities of chemicals and liquid pollutants in the waters of Hutta. Unfortunately, this &quot;processing&quot; doesn't necessarily clean the water. Although the facilities do prevent the planet from becoming entirely lethal to non-Hutt life, their primary job is to filter any valuable compounds from waste dumped into the swamps. These compounds are drained into enormous factory vats. Whatever useless chemicals remain afterward go right back into the swamp water.

The original Jiguuna Muckworks was replaced by new Muckworks--built some distance west of town--several decades ago, but the successor facility went into critical failure shortly after its installation. The &quot;Old Muckworks&quot; returned to use, and the name stuck.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219454" version="1065353216">Hutta Swamps</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219454" version="1065353216">Outside the settled and industrialized sectors of Hutta are the swamps--land occupied only by the desperate and foolhardy. Mutated animal life and crazed bog people are a threat to all ground transport; the Hutts normally travel by air, leaving their humanoid servants to move by foot or landspeeder.

Swampland covers nearly half of Hutta's surface, uninhabitable by galactic standard due to the level of pollutants in the water and air. This wasn't always the case--before the Hutts migrated to the planet, most of what is now swampland was jungle and ocean. Over centuries of intentional planetary engineering and simple neglect, however, the jungles died and the oceans were drained and chemically converted.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219495" version="1065353216">A recent Mandalorian tradition stretching back only a few hundred years, the Great Hunt is considered one of the keenest tests of a professional warrior's skill. While the competition has evolved over the centuries, incorporating more complex rules and greatly expanding its scope, two things have not changed: The challengers hunt each other as often as they do their quarries.

To the modern Mandalorians, the title of Grand Champion is second only in prestige to that of Mand'alor--the Mandalorian leader. In order to earn the title, a competitor must best everything the galaxy can throw at him or her. It's not entirely uncommon for a Great Hunt to end without a surviving competitor left to hold the title. As such, the number of beings who can claim that honor is slim.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219617" version="1065353216">The ancestral homeworld of the Hutts, Varl was destroyed thousands of years ago. No accurate record of the planet's destruction exists, but Hutt mythos suggests that one of Varl's two suns was pulled into a black hole; according to legend, the resulting cataclysm devastated Varl's atmosphere and rendered the entire system uninhabitable.

Several inconsistencies in the story have led many to suspect that the Hutts themselves were responsible for the planet's destruction. Regardless, the Hutts fled the ruined planet and--after displacing the native Evocii--resettled on Hutta.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219618" version="1065353216">Carbonite is a metal alloy that, when mixed with various gasses, can be used to flash freeze blocks of cargo for transportation or storage. Its use in freezing living creatures is relatively new in the galaxy and considered highly dangerous--subjects frozen for more than a few hours have a very low survival rate unless the carbonite is prepared with much expense at an elaborate facility. Even in the best cases, the sudden shock of flash freezing (often combined with a lack of life-support monitoring during suspension) tends to make the process extremely traumatic--sometimes even turning fatal hours after a subject has been thawed.

Still, a quick carbonite spray is the only known technique for freezing living creatures quickly and with minimal preparation. The technology is growing increasingly popular with bounty hunters and smugglers; as a result, many bounty hunting guilds have clauses in their contracts mandating live capture payment even if the bounty fails to survive the post-hibernation period.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219619" version="1065353216">Prior to the Hutts' arrival, Hutta was known as Evocar by the native Evocii. It was a temperate planet characterized by lush rainforests, expansive oceans and towering mountain ranges. Natural resources were plentiful, a fact that no doubt attracted the Hutts as they searched for a new homeworld to settle. The Hutts' occupation of Evocar led to centuries of strip-mining and unchecked consumption that forever altered Evocar, transforming the once-idyllic planet into a polluted, bog-infested wasteland.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219620" version="1065353216">Evocii History</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219620" version="1065353216">While no written record exists concerning the Evocii prior to the Hutts' arrival, it is known that they were a simple and primitive species with a tribal society. When the Hutts discovered Evocar--the planet that would become Hutta--they bartered with each tribe individually, offering wondrous technology in exchange for land until they effectively owned the entire planet. Those Evocii who had refused to sell their freedom were herded onto ships and relocated to Nar Shaddaa, where they were kept as a ready source of cheap labor.

The Hutts' dominion over the Evocii continued unchallenged for centuries until a charismatic Evocii named Ejal led an uprising against the Hutts. Ejal's revolt gained unprecedented momentum until he was betrayed by one of his tribesmen and delivered to his foes. Ejal met a gruesome end while the traitor was awarded his freedom and showered with riches. Even today, the Hutts are fond of this tale, as it reminds the Evocii of the rewards for obedience... and the price of defiance.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219621" version="1065353216">Evocii Tribes</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219621" version="1065353216">Although most Evocii remember little of their culture now, it is certain that the Evocii once existed in hundreds of tribes scattered throughout Hutta's (then known as Evocar) once-lush surface. Usually ruled by a married couple acting as paired chieftains, the Evocii tribes traded and competed with each other, building monuments as proof of their comfort and superior resources. 

The most honored members of the tribe were rarely the chieftains themselves; the Evocii placed higher value on healers, trackers, and those who could predict Evocar's intemperate weather. The tribes were not entirely peaceful, though; the Evocii preferred cunning guerilla attacks and raids to assaulting their enemies directly.

The Hutts ignored the structure of Evocii society when they obtained control of the planet. Tribes were split up and intermingled, eventually losing their identity altogether. Only fragments of Evocii tribal culture remain, mostly in the communities that resisted Hutt rule and vanished into Hutta's swamps.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="219622" version="1065353216">Evocii Exile</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="219622" version="1065353216">When the Hutts resettled on Hutta, they quickly bought up the entire planet and forced the native Evocii offworld. Lacking any reliable means of interstellar travel, the Evocii had no choice but to allow the Hutts to facilitate their relocation to the orbiting moon of Nar Shaddaa.

Countless Evocii were herded onto Hutt cruisers, the Hutts cramming as many natives into each ship as possible. The Hutt shipping containers were not designed to transport living cargo, however, causing thousands of Evocii deaths during the voyage. Worst of all, Nar Shaddaa proved to only be a temporary refuge for the Evocii, as the Hutts already had plans to annex the moon and use the Evocii as cheap labor.</text>

The ancient Sith on Korriban--not an order of Force users, but a distinct species native to the planet--were distinctive for their yellow eyes and blood-red skin. But the warrior Adas was unlike his brothers; his skin was jet-black and he towered over his fellow Sith. Through violence and cunning, he fought his way to become ruler of the Sith and united their nations through a bloody war. He later took the title &quot;Sith'ari,&quot; meaning &quot;overlord.&quot;

King Adas's ascension may have been helped by an untrained Force sensitivity. Certainly Adas was long-lived; his reign lasted three hundred years, and only came to an end when the Infinite Empire launched an assault on Korriban. The title Sith'ari remains a key tenet of Sith lore, eventually coming to refer to a perfect being in Sith philosophy.</text>

The &quot;Infinite Empire&quot; was the name the Rakata people gave to their magnificent but ultimately flawed civilization--one that eventually encompassed more than five hundred known worlds. Their rise was fueled by their impressive technology, powered by what would later be called the Force. Using it, the Rakata developed the first known hyperdrives.

Slowly, the Rakata became corrupted by their power. They began enslaving entire species, including the peoples of Coruscant. The Rakata also attacked Korriban, ruled by the great King Adas. Although their attack failed to enslave the pureblooded Sith species, King Adas was killed. Without his leadership, Korriban was plunged into civil war.

The Rakata's slaves were put to work building monuments to the Infinite Empire's glory. Among the Infinite Empire's achievements was the Star Forge, a space station capable of producing endless droids and starships. However, the Star Forge was fueled by the dark side of the Force. Using it only hastened the Rakata's fall.</text>

The Rakata species had created a glorious Infinite Empire with their Force-fueled machines, but cracks were beginning to show. The cruelty of the Rakata to their slaves and occupied worlds grew more pronounced. If a planet's population rebelled, that entire world would be burned to glass.

Despite this, more slave rebellions began to rise across the galaxy, forcing the Rakata to divide their forces to deal with them. A plague, either created by the rebelling slaves or by Rakata dissidents, began to decimate the Rakata population. The Rakata realized that, possibly due to the plague, they were losing their connection to the Force; without it, they were cut off from their technology.

The fall of the Infinite Empire, once it began, was swift. The slaves overwhelmed their Rakata overseers, who fled into the Unknown Regions of the galaxy. The Rakata degenerated into a tribal culture and even resorted to cannibalism. The Infinite Empire was gone; only its technology was left behind.</text>

Free of the Infinite Empire's enslavement, the humans of Coruscant began investigating the technology their Rakata masters had left. Although they couldn't use the Force-powered machines, the humans learned enough to make tentative forays into space, using slower-than-light vessels manned by crews kept in suspended animation for decades at a time.

Slowly, humans began to colonize new worlds: Alsakan, Metellos, Alderaan. The first explorers to Alderaan discovered the remains of strange insect nests, later known to be built by the Killiks. 

The pureblooded Sith species on Korriban, having survived both the Infinite Empire's onslaught and a bloody civil war after the death of their king, also became intrigued by the machines the Rakata left behind. Suddenly a spacefaring civilization, the Sith species left Korriban and eventually established a new capital on the planet Ziost.</text>

Early spaceflights were conducted with sleeper ships, their crews preserved via suspended animation over the long journeys to other worlds. But these journeys were incredibly slow. Remembering the efficient hyperdrive technology of the Infinite Empire, the most brilliant scientists of the galaxy began to study what remained of those machines, despite the claims of Tiran, the Drall scientist who centuries before said that nothing could travel faster than the speed of light.

Eventually, this led to the development of a hyperspace &quot;cannon.&quot; These cannons allowed a ship to be propelled into hyperspace, though a second cannon was required for a ship to return to its origin point.

The Core Worlds quickly established a hyperspace cannon network. The children of Coruscant soon encountered the Duros civilization, whose people became some of the earliest--and most daring--hyperspace explorers. The true colonization of the galaxy had begun.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220016" version="1065353216">Formally known as the Justicars' Brigade, this militia was formed in the years after the Sacking of Coruscant, when a crime syndicate began seizing control of Coruscant's lower regions. The Republic Senate lacked the resources to challenge the syndicate--later called Black Sun--and withdrew its security forces.

Outraged at Black Sun's treatment of the local citizens, a group of ex-military individuals formed the Justicars, intending to retake their neighborhoods. However, eliminating Black Sun and regaining control proved more difficult than the Justicars had expected. They took extreme measures to restore order, beginning with a simple curfew and culminating in the imposition of martial law.

The Justicars have now instituted checkpoints and armed guards throughout their territory, acting with lethal force against anyone lacking &quot;proper clearance.&quot; Their unshakeable belief that this is necessary to keep people safe only makes the Justicars more dangerous. Coruscant's government has declared the Justicars a threat to be dismantled, and the Justicars have cut off all communication with outsiders.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220018" version="1065353216">Black Sun is a powerful crime syndicate that rose to prominence on Coruscant in the latter days of the war. Taking advantage of the chaos and rioting in the city after the planet's sacking, several gangsters joined forces and began seizing control of lower-city neighborhoods. The origin of the syndicate's name is unclear, but a common phrase among despairing Coruscant citizens was &quot;better a black sun than none.&quot; Alas, hopes that Black Sun would bring order instead of anarchy died quickly.

For Black Sun, the rioting and looting never really stopped. Although the gangsters have profitable spice- and weapons-trafficking operations, their members, almost to a man, have an extraordinary taste for violence. Civilians are extorted until they have nothing left to extort; afterwards, they're used for target practice. City blocks are incinerated for the pleasure of demolitionists.

Despite the efforts of the Justicars' Brigade, Black Sun has become a force to be reckoned with. The Republic Senate has begun to realize the threat Black Sun represents, but with the syndicate's influence already beginning to stretch beyond Coruscant, stopping it may be impossible.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220019" version="1065353216">On paper, the Migrant Merchants' Guild is a legitimate trade consortium that advocates for refugee rights and supports the Coruscant reconstruction effort. In reality, the Migrant Merchants' Guild is a highly organized crime syndicate that seized power during the riots at the old Galactic Market after the war.

Even before the war's end, the guild served as a front for money laundering and goods smuggling, but kept mostly to nonviolent crime. Its membership was primarily nonhuman, and represented a powerful economic force inside Coruscant's nonhuman immigrant population. When riots broke out, the guild saw an opportunity to claim real power; after security forces withdrew, it was the guild that re-established &quot;order&quot; with its armed goons and provided food and supplies... at a price.

Since then, the Migrant Merchants' Guild has expanded into bribery and extortion, with the old Galactic Market at the heart of its territory, all the while keeping a thin veneer of respectability. Republic security patrols often clash with members of the Migrant Merchants' Guild in an attempt to keep the peace, but recently the guild has been moving its influence from shaking down local businesses to Coruscant politics.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220021" version="1065353216">Twenty years ago, the old Galactic Market was a bustling center of commerce where the goods and wealth of the galaxy flowed freely. Since the Treaty of Coruscant, however, the market has become a shadow of its former self. 

The old Galactic Market was the site of extraordinary scenes after the war. Thousands of homes in the lower reaches of Coruscant--most belonging to poor families--were destroyed during the Imperial invasion. The homeless families squatted in the marketplace; when ordered to leave by Republic military forces, the squatters rioted in protest.

The market has never been truly safe since, and the criminal Migrant Merchants' Guild has gradually established its own control over the area. While careful and well-armed visitors can still find useful technology or rare weapons there, most are advised to stay away.</text>

After the temple was bombed in the initial attack, the upper floors were deliberately collapsed on Darth Malgus's orders. The Jedi Temple's tower, once a Coruscant landmark, broke free during the bombing and fell to the city's lower levels. The old Jedi Council chamber is the only room left largely intact, but it is still considered dangerous and prone to collapse.

The temple ruins have continued to see strife even after the Sacking of Coruscant. They were the site of a duel between Darth Malgus and the Jedi empath Aryn Leneer before Imperial forces were withdrawn from the planet. Exceptionally brave and lucky looters have also disturbed the ruins, hunting--and often finding--valuable Jedi artifacts.</text>

The reconstruction effort began almost immediately after the Empire's withdrawal, but in a crowded city-world where skyscrapers can be kilometers high, simply demolishing one safely can take months.

Although donations flowed freely from the Republic, corruption and political squabbling caused further delays. Finally, Vanara Kayl, Senator for Coruscant, gave an impassioned speech claiming that deliberate interference in Coruscant's rebuilding verged on treason. Impressed by her fervor, the Supreme Chancellor gave Senator Kayl full authority over the reconstruction efforts, which have proceeded relatively smoothly ever since.</text>

Every member world in the Republic is entitled to a seat in the Galactic Senate and the right to vote on legislation. Due to the sheer size of the Senate, which represents thousands of worlds, Senators negotiate alliances--occasionally through backroom deals--to strengthen their position on important issues.

Large-scale military deployments must be approved by the Senate. Jedi activities are officially outside the Senate's jurisdiction; unofficially, the Jedi Council prefers to be in harmony with the Senate's wishes, and avoid a threat to their independence from Senate action.

The head of the Galactic Senate--and therefore the Republic itself--is the Supreme Chancellor. The Supreme Chancellor is elected by the Senate and serves a four-year term. In recent years, campaigns to become Supreme Chancellor have become more and more low-key, as candidates fear assassination by the Empire.</text>

The Sith Empire, having fought the Republic for decades since its surprise return, suddenly contacted the Republic Senate to propose a treaty. Although the Republic was suspicious, the war had stretched its capabilities and resources to a breaking point. Peace seemed the only hope of survival. 

Diplomats from both sides traveled to Alderaan to discuss the treaty, but the Empire was already making its move. An Imperial fleet descended on Coruscant and launched a massive orbital bombardment against the city. As the Sith Lord Darth Malgus marched into the Jedi Temple, other Imperial forces captured the Senate tower. The entire planet was effectively held hostage.

Knowing that &quot;peace negotiations&quot; were over, the Supreme Chancellor reluctantly signed the Treaty of Coruscant, dictated by the Empire. Although years of uneasy peace have followed, the Sacking of Coruscant remains a vivid and painful memory for the Republic; for the Empire, one of its greatest victories.</text>

Angral personally executed the Supreme Chancellor and was preparing to force an unconditional surrender when the Emperor unexpectedly signed a peace treaty with the Republic.

Darth Angral was furious to see his victory dissolve into a protracted and unresolved cold war. Although his success on Coruscant opened a path to the Empire's fabled Dark Council, Angral abandoned Sith politics to pursue a private agenda. He spent years after the war consolidating a significant power base.

The culmination of Darth Angral's plans to finally destroy the Republic unraveled on Coruscant when his son Tarnis was exposed as an undercover Sith infiltrator and killed by Jedi. Seeing his only son cut down drove Darth Angral over the edge, setting him on a path to utterly annihilate the Republic or die trying.</text>

Cool-headed as a strategist, Var Suthra is nonetheless passionately committed to defeating the enemy once and for all.

General Var Suthra has no family but the Republic he serves. He saw the devastation of Coruscant when the Sith Empire sacked it and vowed &quot;never again.&quot; Var Suthra is merciless towards the Empire, sympathetic to the Jedi and always seems to be carrying the weight of the galaxy on his shoulders.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220046" version="1065353216">One of the most experienced officers in the Galactic Republic military, General Garza is a tactical and strategic genius with a near-flawless operational record. She served with distinction in the war against the Empire and played an instrumental role in the formation and training of the army's elite Special Forces division.

Although her achievements are numerous, Garza has become a figure of increasing controversy. She has a reputation for being ruthless and uncompromising, and is often accused of authorizing secret assaults against Imperial interests throughout the galaxy. These accusations remain unproven, but few doubt the lengths that Garza will go to secure victory for the Republic.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220057" version="1065353216">The Corellian Engineering Corporation is one of the largest civilian starship manufacturers in the galaxy. Known for building ships that are fast, sturdy and highly customizable, their vessels essentially serve as blank slates for an owner's modifications. CEC is also known for its unsupported short runs of certain products, when an engineer gets &quot;creative&quot; and supplies customers with uniquely tuned equipment. Luck can be important when buying from CEC.

The XS Stock Light Freighter came into service almost twenty years ago. Larger and more versatile than its predecessors, and featuring a variety of optional upgrades that can make it one of the most nimble ships in the galaxy, the model has seen more than its share of use. Rigged with an oversized cargo hold, passenger quarters, multiple laser turrets and a thick armor layer, the XS is an old favorite of captains traveling through dangerous space.

The XS has one other feature not widely advertised: its maintenance compartments can be rearranged and concealed to serve as ideal hiding spots for contraband cargo. Even security officers aware of this trick can be stumped by the work of an imaginative owner.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="220059" version="1065353216">Rendili Hyperworks BT-7 Thunderclap (Trooper)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220059" version="1065353216">Based on smaller rapid assault ships, the BT-7 Thunderclap was originally developed during the war for fast deployment under fire. This revised design has been outfitted for Republic Special Forces with a streamlined hull, prototype armor plating and flexible bulkheads designed to absorb heavy impacts.

The Thunderclap's main deck features a command center, secure armory, fully outfitted medical bay and briefing room. Provisions have been made for squad comfort with a spacious bunk room and recreational facilities. The upper deck houses the bridge and navigation computer, and can be sealed by heavy pressure doors in an emergency.

For armaments, the Thunderclap has one primary and two secondary heavy laser cannons. State-of-the-art tactical computers and targeting systems ensure every shot counts. Although the ship's design is intended to deflect blaster fire away from the main compartments, modular shield systems ensure few attacks get that close.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="220062" version="1065353216">Corellian Defender-class Light Corvette (Knight/Consular)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220062" version="1065353216">During the Great War, the Jedi Order was granted use of Republic military vessels, but these starships proved unsuitable for the specialized assignments Jedi often undertake. Eventually the Jedi Council decided to commission a new corvette, custom-built for Jedi missions.

The Defender-class corvette is built on two decks. The lower deck is based on a standard keel and houses a cargo hold, engine compartment and full medical bay. Most of the Defender's customization is on the flight deck, which includes a private cabin and meditation chamber, along with a state-of-the-art cockpit. At the center of the ship is a spacious conference room equipped with a holocommunicator for discussions with the Jedi Council or diplomatic talks.

Although peace is a key tenet of the Jedi, so is self-defense. In case of hostile action, the Defender possesses a high-powered shield array and twin laser cannons.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="220065" version="1065353216">Fury-class Imperial Interceptor (Warrior/Inquisitor)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220065" version="1065353216">Featuring an advanced hyperdrive and state-of-the-art sublight engines, the Fury is the most versatile starship in the Imperial fleet and the end result of centuries of evolving design. The modern Fury was originally conceived for use in high-priority military missions but is now used almost exclusively by Sith and outfitted accordingly.

The Fury's angular design combines the maneuverability of a fighter with impressive armament rivaling some larger military vessels. The Fury also features a set of &quot;strike foils&quot; that remain down for travel but can be expanded in short-range combat to maximize the ship's agility and range of firepower.

The interior aesthetic is sleek and functional, arranged in the traditions of the Sith Academy on Korriban. Military-grade computers and communications equipment are integrated into the ship's hardware, and hidden security devices make sabotage extremely difficult and dangerous.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="220067" version="1065353216">X-70B Phantom-class Prototype (Agent)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220067" version="1065353216">One of the most sophisticated lightweight starships in the galaxy, the X-70B Phantom is an experimental model designed to resemble a luxury shuttle while possessing the combat capacity of a heavy starfighter. Beneath the sleek metal exterior and the interior wood paneling is an unmatched density of sophisticated circuits, wires, cooling systems and other components, many never before used in a starship of this size.

The X-70B shields its military-grade hardware from virtually all scanners, allowing it to travel unnoticed among civilian vessels. Its own sensor capabilities are formidable, and although not normally equipped with a cloaking device (due to heat and power concerns), the ship can be refitted with such a module for short-term missions.

Maintenance work on the X-70B is extraordinarily difficult and expensive due to the super-compressed nature of its mechanics, making the Phantom-class an unlikely candidate for wide-scale production. This difficulty is only aggravated by the fact that Imperial Intelligence refuses to share its ship specifications with the Imperial military.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="220069" version="1065353216">Kuat Drive Yards D5-Mantis Patrol Craft (Bounty Hunter)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220069" version="1065353216">The D5-Mantis is an alpha predator in the cold depths of space. Designed to meet the hefty demands of a much larger interdiction vessel, the Mantis was given a compact frame and built to fight--and nothing else. By employing three retractable weapon foils with independent power supplies, the Mantis is capable of safely deploying armament intended for larger class vessels, as well as reducing its profile significantly in order to be packed tightly into carrier ships with a surprising number of other Mantis crafts.

To mitigate what would otherwise be an extremely cramped interior, the engineers of the D5-Mantis make efficient use of vertical space and minimal bulkheads to provide more open areas and ensure ease of access for maintenance.

Although the D5-Mantis is considered a best-in-class vessel, spotting one in use is a relatively rare sight. The prohibitive cost of building a completely independent, long-range picket ship prevented the Mantis from seeing large-scale production.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220337" version="1065353216">In the ancient past, the Sith Lords of Korriban perfected an art they called alchemy--a synthesis of scientific lore and dark side philosophy. Sith alchemy was a tool to transform life itself, to reshape flesh and bone and create terrifying servants out of mere animals.

Creations of Sith alchemy are called Sithspawn. Each is unique, crafted by the hand of a Dark Lord with monstrous intent. Most are ancient, as few Sith continue to practice alchemy; although the art is not lost, it has fallen out of favor. A Sithspawn is unnatural by definition, built for near-immortality and typically violent beyond measure; a perfect weapon, and if bound, a perfect guardian.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="220343" version="1065353216">The Obliteration of Kressh</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220343" version="1065353216">Since before the Great Hyperspace War, the Kressh bloodline was a proud and noble one in the Empire. Pureblooded Sith Lords, strong in the Force, were born to the Kressh line generation after generation. Statues and monuments to Kressh champions could be found across Dromund Kaas--until the Emperor declared the Kressh name an abomination and ordered all evidence of the family obliterated.

The reasons why are no longer clear, if they ever were. Once the task is complete, the order itself will be wiped from history. Some believe that the last scion of the Kressh bloodline somehow betrayed the Emperor--but anyone who knows the full truth keeps it to himself.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220508" version="1065353216">Known for their bizarre and wonderful technology as much as their unusual cephalopodic anatomy, the Gree are one of the oldest species in the galaxy. Their civilization once flourished in the Outer Rim, though the glory days of their people ended thousands of years before the rise of the Republic.

In modern times, with much of their history forgotten and the greatest achievements of their people lost, most Gree live in seclusion in the Enclave--a mid-sized region of space carefully isolated from outside contact. However, the Gree reputation as engineers and artisans is still unmatched. Genuine Gree technology is worth a fortune to collectors and researchers--though few Gree would part with such treasures, preferring to lend their skills instead.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220559" version="1065353216">Prone to cynicism and a stubborn independent streak, Kira Carsen is an improbable recruit to the Jedi Order. This is partially excused by the fact that she began her Padawan training as a young adult; Kira had spent most of her life up to that point as a homeless drifter, scraping out a miserable existence on some of the galaxy's most unpleasant worlds.

Thanks to her hard-luck upbringing, Kira has considerably more life experience than most Jedi--and a world-weary sophisticate's attitude to match. In the eyes of her peers, Kira is someone who refuses to take anything seriously or fully commit to the Jedi path.

Those who look more closely, however, might detect the glimmer of an optimist peeking through Kira's sarcastic facade. Despite her insistence on questioning its teachings, she has a deep appreciation for the comfort and relative safety she obtained by joining the Jedi Order.

Likes: Being funny, getting involved, mocking and defeating the Empire
Dislikes: Bullying, acting like a mercenary, cooperating with Sith

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220567" version="1065353216">The Strategic Information Service (SIS) is the Republic's premiere intelligence and espionage agency. Chartered and overseen by the Galactic Senate, the SIS is responsible for information gathering and covert operations both inside and out of Republic space, as well as for assisting the military, local law enforcement and the Jedi Order.

The SIS is the latest in a long line of Republic espionage agencies founded and disbanded over the centuries. Originally a monitoring and decryption arm of the Senate library, the SIS rapidly expanded during the war against the Empire. It remains smaller, more focused and comparatively underfunded in comparison to Imperial Intelligence, but has proven its effectiveness many times over.

Although by no means a secret organization, the SIS keeps a relatively low profile. SIS operations are rarely revealed, and its administrators almost never appear alongside Senators or other officials. This is a public relations gambit--the SIS believes that the Republic citizenry would be uncomfortable with the nature of its work, and so avoids attracting attention and unwanted questions.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220568" version="1065353216">Republic member worlds are required to maintain civilian law enforcement organizations, overseen by their planetary governments instead of the Galactic Senate. Coruscant Security is one of the oldest planetary police forces in the Republic and has a reputation for effectiveness, diversity and (on the whole) positive relations with Coruscant's population.

The Sacking of Coruscant took a toll on Coruscant Security--both in lives lost and burnout as years of rebuilding, riot control and military intervention followed. The rise of major criminal syndicates on Coruscant has embittered many young recruits, and frustrated veterans who were trained to track and arrest individuals, not fight block by block to reclaim territory from gangs.

Some say that unless Coruscant Security is given quasi-military training and heavy equipment, it will eventually be overwhelmed by the planet's problems. Few security officers favor such extreme measures, however--they joined the force to keep the peace, not to fight a war in the streets of the planet they love.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220822" version="1065353216">Amphibious humanoids from the planet Glee Anselm, Nautolans are distinguished by their tentacle-like head-tresses. Because of its primarily aquatic surface and its location off the major hyperlanes, only a handful of outsiders have ever visited Glee Anselm; as a result, little is known about Nautolan culture on their homeworld, though extrapolations can be made from those individuals who venture out into the greater galaxy.

Despite their aquatic origins, Nautolans can breathe air and are completely at home on land, and they can be found in a wide variety of professions. They have a reputation for being both smart and practical, and the existence of several Nautolan Jedi speaks to an affinity with the Force. With the arrival of the Empire, the Nautolans fought alongside the Republic, although some among them fear this will lead to unnecessary suffering for their people.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220824" version="1065353216">Adventurous and outgoing, Sullustans are as comfortable seated at the controls of a ship as they are in the underground cities of their homeworld. Whether their affinity for navigation and exploration is genetic or cultural is a matter of some debate, but the end result is that Sullustans are found throughout the galaxy where they are heavily recruited as crew members on both civilian and military vessels.

The planet Sullust is currently under Imperial control, a fact that does not sit well with the Sullustans themselves. Due to Imperial censorship of planet-wide communications, little is known about resistance efforts on the surface. However, Sullustans in the rest of the galaxy are almost universal in their support of the Republic, with most eager to do anything they can to aid in the eventual liberation of their homeworld.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220826" version="1065353216">The Gand are a keen-eyed and sturdy species of insect-like humanoids. Comprised of over a dozen subtly distinct subspecies, several types of Gand require breathing apparatuses to survive outside the ammonia-rich atmosphere of their homeworld.

Despite this handicap, Gand make some of the best bounty hunters and trackers in the galaxy, and the art of the hunt is an integral part of Gand culture. The most revered Gand profession is that of Findsman: Part-shaman, part-bounty hunter, a Findsman uses a combination of ritual and skill to track his prey and bring him to justice. 

Under other circumstances, the Gand's skill as hunters and natural physical hardiness might have led them to become a proud race. However, Gand are noted for being humble and self-deprecating. Most Gand refer to themselves in the third person, as Gand culture dictates that an individual's identity must first be earned. Only the most notable Gand ever call themselves &quot;I.&quot;</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="220829" version="1065353216">For over 200,000 years, Coruscant has been one of the most important planets in the galaxy. It has seen and survived dozens of wars, suffered under the control of alien species, served as the capital of the Republic and--according to common wisdom--ushered in the birth of the human species.

In ancient times, before the planet became a city, Coruscant was a world covered mainly in oceans. Over millennia, humans spread out over the land masses, covering them with structures--and as technology developed and overpopulation grew more troublesome, the Coruscanti people sought ways to house their ever-growing numbers. Eventually, the seas themselves were drained, and the humans spread into the empty basins.

It has been over 100,000 years since sunlight last reached the lowest levels of the city. Now, Coruscant stands as a marvel of engineering and sentient triumph, home to thousands of species and countless billions of individuals. Archaeologists spend their whole lives descending through the city's layers, searching for answers about its distant past, and no one in the universe knows Coruscant's full story.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224752" version="1065353216">Even on Hutta, even in communities built around theft and violence, there are outcasts. People who cross a line, committing acts so vile that their fellow criminals don't dare retain them; people who lose everything, and have nowhere to turn; people who outrage their Hutt overlords. These people are exiled to the swamps, and most die quickly... but not all.

Survivors learn what it takes to endure in the swamps--respirators to cut down on toxic gas inhalation, medicinal compounds to counteract absorbed chemicals, specially treated clothes to alter one's scent, and blasters, of course, for self-defense. But no one can escape the changes wrought by living submerged in poison, and survivors suffer from paranoia, delusions and hallucinations. They become, as locals say, &quot;bog people.&quot;

For the most part, bog people aren't organized--but they form packs and adopt new exiles to teach them the ways of the world. They are invariably violent (and most always were, even before becoming pariahs), and target anyone of any species in hopes of obtaining supplies.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224754" version="1065353216">Not all Evocii have accepted the Hutts' tyranny; many Evocii prefer to fight, rather than kneel, when they first taste the foreman's lash. These radicals are typically shunned by their tribesmen, who fear that associating with rebels will incur the Hutts' wrath.

Such outcasts often band together to form small, informal tribes that work together to overthrow the Hutts. While these renegade Evocii are rarely able to confront the Hutts directly, Cartel enforcers and foremen alike have learned to fear these bloodthirsty outlaws.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224785" version="1065353216">Originally founded as &quot;Czerka Mining and Industrial,&quot; this centuries-old, galaxy-spanning corporation has diversified into businesses ranging from consumer food products to military weapons. It is one of the wealthiest and most successful economic enterprises in operation, conducting commerce on virtually every civilized planet and--as owner of multiple star systems and employer of several billion individuals--has representation in the Republic Senate.

Czerka is unique in being able to negotiate trade agreements with the Hutt Cartel and other independent worlds, crossing political borders with impunity to generate staggering profits. Despite the company's perceived lack of loyalty, no one can afford to stop doing business with Czerka. &quot;Anytime, anywhere... we're there&quot; is the corporation's slogan--a motto that unscrupulous opportunists eagerly endorse.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="224787" version="1065353216">Hutt Cartel</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224787" version="1065353216">Officially, the Hutt Cartel is a business alliance between several different Hutt clans, working together towards the common goals of wealth and prosperity. Between its members, the Hutt Cartel controls vast resources, countless credits and many independent worlds--not least among them Hutta, their adopted homeworld, and Nar Shaddaa, the crown jewel of the underworld. Although the Hutts have no formal government, the Hutt Cartel acts as a loose governing body on these worlds and others.

Unofficially, the Hutt Cartel is a ruthless crime syndicate whose goals are not always so united. Turf wars and clan infighting have often left the Cartel in splintered uproar. Personal grudges and cutthroat competition can result in two rival clans warring in the streets one day and feasting together the next.

While historically the Hutt Cartel has remained neutral in galactic affairs, both the Republic and the Empire have made recent attempts to secure the Hutts' loyalty. It remains to be seen what the outcome of these attempts will be--and what effect the Hutt Cartel will have on the galaxy at large.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224794" version="1065353216">The ancient Sith tombs of Korriban have long been a target of raiders and treasure seekers with dreams of valuable plunder. While many are the minions and hirelings of Sith Lords hoping to lay their hands on powerful relics, others are daring fortune hunters who come from offworld and risk conflict with the Sith.

Individual pirates and rogues occasionally arrive stowed away on ships, but a more organized group led by an eccentric underworld figure has infiltrated shipments of slaves sent to the red planet. Once on the surface, the &quot;slaves&quot; sneak into the tombs; few ever leave Korriban, but those who survive are paid handsomely for their trouble.</text>

Each is among the most powerful Sith in the galaxy; to hold a seat on the council is the highest honor and the greatest position of influence a Sith can attain.

The individual members of the Dark Council control their own spheres of influence and pyramids of subordinate Sith--overall Imperial military strategy falls in the hands of one Dark Council member, while study of ancient artifacts falls into the hands of another. These spheres occasionally overlap, leading to conflict. However, every Sith Lord and apprentice is ultimately answerable to the council member at the top of his or her pyramid. Similarly, non-Sith organizations are usually clearly answerable to one Dark Council member or another.

Meetings of the Dark Council are normally held in the Citadel on Dromund Kaas or in the Sith Academy on Korriban. It's rare for all members to gather at once--power plays among members are frequent, and several of the Dark Lords are virtual hermits. On the occasions when the Emperor summons them, however, all members of the Dark Council are expected to gather and obey.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224817" version="1065353216">Less than two centuries old, Fa'athra is an upstart among the Hutt clans. Instead of focusing on the slow accumulation of wealth and power with the intent of crushing his enemies with unstoppable force, Fa'athra is a nimble strategist, making prey of enemies too entrenched to respond quickly. After eliminating several Hutts in disfavor with the Cartel, he chose Nem'ro as his next target, seeing a ready-made power base ripe for the taking.

While Fa'athra is less than devoted to Hutt Cartel law, he considers himself a disciple of ancient Hutt traditions abandoned by most of his species. Rumors abound that he is a member--possibly the only surviving member--of one of the lost cults of Varl.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224819" version="1065353216">When a Hutt reaches the pinnacle of his career, it is his right and privilege to let his mind and body atrophy--to turn away from menial concerns and strictly indulge his appetites. So it goes with Nem'ro.

Decades ago, Nem'ro was a scheming and ambitious leader among the gangs of Jiguuna. Block by block, factory by factory, he took control through brutality, blackmail and sheer business savvy. He paid his henchmen handsomely and overthrew Jiguuna's previous ruler in a bloody coup. He never did get rid of the competing gangs; he just cowed them and demanded a share of the profits.

Now, comfortable and confident, Nem'ro is free to let his lieutenants run the show while he concentrates on what makes life worth living: food, arena fights and reveling in the respect of his peers. Only the rise of Fa'athra, a Hutt upstart and would-be rival, threatens to force his attention back on business affairs.</text>

Sworn to protect and defend the Republic, the Council has existed in one form or another for millennia, comprised of the wisest Jedi Masters of every era. 

After the destruction of the Jedi Temple and the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, the modern council removed itself from the politics of the galactic capital and settled on Tython, the ancestral home of the Jedi. Led by Master Satele Shan, the Council now struggles to uphold its peaceful ideals in the face of the Sith threat. This paradox is reflected in the personalities and beliefs of various members of the Council--some, such as the scholarly Master Syo Bakarn, hope the Sith can be redeemed and turned to the light side; others, such as the militaristic Master Jaric Kaedan, believe peace can only be achieved when all those who serve the dark side are destroyed.</text>

Although their numbers are few, the Pilgrim movement goes back almost two decades--and until their recent arrival on Tython, they had never possessed a permanent home, nor escaped persecution.

The founding Pilgrim Matriarch gained her followers while serving at a refugee settlement catering to escapees from Ryloth--the enslaved Twi'lek homeworld. The refugees listened to the Matriarch's stories about a set of ancient texts she had discovered on an alien world, which urged simplicity, devotion to family and faith in a spiritual mother. But while some Twi'leks gladly joined the Matriarch, others saw her as a cult leader taking advantage of the desperate.

The Pilgrims left the settlement and traveled to one Twi'lek settlement after another, gaining in numbers but always driven off. Fleeing into hyperspace after years of wandering, the Pilgrims at last arrived on Tython. The Jedi, only recently arrived themselves, were astonished that the Pilgrims could stumble upon the secret Jedi homeworld so easily; the Matriarch saw the Pilgrims' discovery of an inhabitable planet as destiny.

Since then, the Pilgrims have done everything possible to make a permanent home of Tython, building their community and creating new traditions. Whether the movement will survive in the face of the Flesh Raider danger is an open question.</text>

Due to the great diversity of service personnel present in the Republic military, regulations specify that the honorific &quot;sir&quot; should be used when addressing any personnel of higher rank than oneself, regardless of the species, gender or position of the addressee.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224935" version="1065353216">Shortly after the end of the war between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire, a series of scandals revealed corruption inside Ord Mantell's government. Both local journalists and an official Republic Senate investigation proved vital in removing the corrupt cabinet members, but at the same time, a small but vocal group of citizens decided they'd had enough.

The protesters declared that the Republic wasn't doing enough to stop Ord Mantell's criminal leaders from exploiting common citizens and that any official investigations were &quot;half-measures.&quot; These separatists demanded the planet's independence. Unsurprisingly, neither the Republic nor Ord Mantell's leaders were prepared to answer the cries for secession.

No one realized how powerful and well-organized the separatists had become until a massive coordinated bombing attack destroyed every major spaceport across the planet. The destruction left the world in chaos, crippling its economy. As the government retaliated against the separatists, Ord Mantell descended into civil war.

The separatists' terms for peace are simple: resignation of Ord Mantell's entire government, trials and imprisonment of its criminal leaders and the immediate recognition by the Republic of the world's independence. With a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fresh recruits armed with military-grade weapons, the separatists show no signs of backing down from this fight.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="224950" version="1065353216">An interspecies warrior culture stretching back thousands of years, the Mandalorians live for one purpose: to challenge the greatest opponents in combat and claim victory, for honor and glory. The best are proud fighters driven by a noble code, while the worst are bloodthirsty killers always looking for the next battle.

While many act as independent mercenaries, the Mandalorians are divided into clans each answering to their own leader. From time to time in history, a single leader of all clans appears and is called &quot;Mandalore.&quot; Each new leader of the Mandalorians takes the name and mask of Mandalore and determines whether the clans will scatter or unite against a great foe. Initiates can be born into Mandalorian society or inducted from outside; either way, new Mandalorians face harsh trials as they prove themselves worthy and learn the secrets of Mandalorian weapons and armor.

The Mandalorians have been loosely allied with the Sith Empire since the Empire's return to the galaxy and played an instrumental role in the Sacking of Coruscant. Though not Imperial subjects, the Mandalorians have an enclave in the Citadel on Dromund Kaas. Their relationship with the Empire is sometimes strained, but the alliance offers one undeniable advantage: ample opportunity to face the galaxy's greatest warriors, the Jedi.</text>

Although his claim has not been widely recognized, he controls a substantial private army on Dromund Kaas. The Dark Council has authorized all-out warfare against Lord Grathan and anyone who supports him.

After being driven from the Citadel, Lord Grathan holed up in his estate outside Kaas City. His forces there are made up of apprentices, loyal Imperial troops and cybernetic supersoldiers he developed in his secret weapons labs. His cadre of elite scientists--some volunteers, others kidnapped and forced into service--manufactures a seemingly endless number of war droids, as well, reducing attrition in Grathan's army to near zero.</text>

The Dark Council member who presides over Dromund Kaas, Darth Hadra, is currently embroiled in a conflict with the Dark Council member in charge of ancient Sith secrets and history, Darth Arctis.

Darth Hadra's forces discovered an ancient Sith shrine outside Kaas City and claimed it in her name. Darth Arctis quickly challenged her claim to the discovery, arguing that the contents of the shrine were his domain. While the conflict over the shrine has not yet come to all-out warfare between the two Dark Council members, Darth Hadra has positioned her forces in the area around the shrine, with orders to attack anyone who trespasses. The rest of the Dark Council is turning a blind eye toward any fighting with Hadra's forces while Hadra and Arctis &quot;negotiate&quot; for control of the shrine.</text>

Many theories abound as to how the rebellion started, and its duration suggests that other, more powerful parties have become involved in secretly supporting the rebels. This is the largest slave rebellion in Dromund Kaas history, and second only to the rebellion led by Dakar Sol on Malachor Five in the history of the Empire.

Efforts have been made to contain the rebellion and keep it from spilling over into Kaas City, but the Dark Council has yet to act decisively on the matter, preferring to let the rebellion continue as a warning to overambitious Sith.</text>

The society is believed to be several hundred strong, ranging from powerful and influential Sith Lords to military officers and alien slaves--low status is no barrier to entry, but personal power and fervor are everything. Some so-called Revanites devote their lives to the cult's teachings and exist outside of mainstream Imperial society; others study and meet in secret while maintaining ordinary lives.

The Order of Revan takes its name from an ancient Sith Lord--a fallen Jedi who used both the dark side and the light side of the Force during his lifetime. Revan drew strength from passion, as well as tranquility; took allies who were human and alien, weak and strong. Revanites seek to emulate Revan's ways, seeing him as the greatest of all teachers.</text>

United under a single Emperor and his Dark Council, ruled by the Force-sensitive members of the Sith Order and supported by countless loyal citizens, the Empire forsakes the freedoms offered by the Republic in favor of strength and order. Aiming to take revenge on the Republic for its exile centuries ago, the Sith Empire will stop at nothing to become the greatest power in the galaxy.

Although an uneasy truce has settled over the galaxy, the Empire does not sit idle. From its capital of Dromund Kaas, Imperial leadership exerts total control over the worlds it has conquered, rebuilding its forces to once again march on the Republic.</text>

Ruled by a Senate comprised of delegates from all its member worlds and overseen by a Senate-appointed Supreme Chancellor, the Republic struggles to restore its former greatness in the wake of the Sith Empire's invasion decades ago. Having emerged victorious in numerous conflicts in the past with the aid of its protectors in the Jedi Order, the Republic has no intention of allowing the Empire to consume the entire galaxy.

After its capital world of Coruscant was sacked by the Empire, the Republic was forced to sign a painful peace treaty, losing control of many outlying worlds. While the Empire consolidates its power, the Republic and the Jedi hurry to rebuild and prepare for the next conflict sure to come.</text>

Satele has played a key role in recent galactic history in other ways, as well. She fought on the front lines of several major battles--including the battles of Alderaan and Rhen Var--and was present as a Padawan during the Imperial retaking of Korriban, the first modern contact between the Sith Empire and the Republic. She is greatly respected by certain members of the Republic military, and her advice is often sought by the Supreme Chancellor. In person, Satele's strength in the Force is matched with a keen intelligence and a subtle sense of humor.</text>

Toward the end of the Great Hyperspace War, besieged on all sides by the forces of Naga Sadow's Sith Empire, the Republic prepared for a last, desperate stand at the red giant Primus Goluud. Sadow's fleet clashed with the might of the Republic Navy, while Sith forces fought the Jedi on the surface of Coruscant itself.

Gav Daragon, who had been fooled into becoming Naga Sadow's servant, led the assault on his homeworld, Koros Major. When one of his friends was killed, Gav realized Sadow had been manipulating him, and defected to the Republic. Alongside Empress Teta's forces, he joined the battle at Primus Goluud.

Trapped, Sadow used a superweapon to explode the red giant. Sadow's forces escaped into hyperspace before the shockwave hit; Gav Daragon was killed, but not before he had transmitted Korriban's coordinates to Empress Teta and the Republic fleet.</text>

The two Sith Lords fought furiously, only to be interrupted by the Republic fleet, which had pursued Sadow through hyperspace. The Republic began to attack the Sith forces, quickly gaining the upper hand.

Sadow took desperate measures. He forced one of his captains to ram Kressh's flagship, killing his rival once and for all. Left with only a single vessel and a crew of slaves, Sadow escaped the battle and fled to the remote jungle world of Yavin Four. Sadow then placed himself in a long stasis, still dreaming of a Sith golden age.</text>

Led by their new Emperor, the survivors of the Sith Empire had left Korriban aboard a small fleet following the Great Hyperspace War. There was no place in known space they could hide from the Republic--and so, undaunted, they fled into the unknown regions of the galaxy. Where the old Sith Empire had often been divided by rivalries, the survivors were now united, both by their desire to find a new home and by their anger at the Republic that had sought to destroy them.

For decades, the fleet wandered among the stars--until one day, a scout vessel returned to the armada with incredible news. Either by luck or by the esoteric designs of the often-silent Emperor, the Sith had rediscovered a long-lost outpost world: the jungle planet of Dromund Kaas. Absent from any star charts, Dromund Kaas presented a perfect refuge where the Sith Empire could rebuild and plan its revenge.</text>

It is clear from the records that Nathema is not the original name of the world, but why it was changed and why he was there has been carefully purged from all records.

What is known is that following the flight of Naga Sadow, the Emperor came to Korriban, gathered the remaining lords of the Sith and took them back with him to Nathema. There they conducted a ritual that extended the Emperor's life at the cost of the lives of more than eight thousand Sith Lords. The Ritual of Nathema is celebrated among Imperial scholars as a rare and amazing coming together of Sith for the good of the Empire.

The Emperor then gathered the younger generation of Sith, promoted new lords and promised them revenge on the Republic for its attempted genocide of the Sith people. Aboard a small fleet, the Sith Empire vanished into unknown space, leaving no trace for the Republic to find.</text>

With the end of the Great Hyperspace War, the Republic and the Jedi began to purge the remnants of the Sith Empire--obliterating its power centers, destroying its dark teachings and leaving its people without a clear leader. The Supreme Chancellor and his allies argued that this was not a battle against the Empire's citizenry, but a necessary step to free the Sith from corruption.

The survivors among the Sith--and they were few, as famine, disease and infighting claimed those who did not continue to face down the Republic--saw it as a deathblow to their culture. But a savior arose: The man who would one day become Emperor of the Sith had weathered the war with a number of trusted followers. No record of the Sith Emperor's original identity has survived, but he was quickly accepted as the leader of the almost-shattered Sith Empire. 

Although the Republic had temporarily retreated from the Horuset system, the Sith Emperor knew that Korriban would not be safe for long. While the few survivors emerged from their shelters in the deserts and shattered tombs, the Sith Emperor began to devise a plan, centuries in the execution, that would ensure the survival of the Sith and the eventual annihilation of the Republic.</text>

Exiled for horrific dark side experiments, a group of Dark Jedi made a last stand against the Jedi Order on Corbos, where they were ultimately defeated. The survivors fled beyond the borders of Republic space and, seeking a refuge, they discovered the planet Korriban--home to the red-skinned Sith species. The Sith looked on the Dark Jedi's Force abilities with awe, and worshipped them as gods.

Led by the fabled warrior and tactician Ajunta Pall, the Dark Jedi began forging the Sith into a glorious civilization, built on the principles they had established after breaking with the Jedi Order. They ordered the construction of great monuments on Korriban--vast cities that did not survive the ages, glorious temples and elaborate tombs.

As time passed, the Dark Jedi and the Sith species intermarried, until there were few true purebloods remaining. Eventually, there were only small physical differences between them. There were only the Sith, strong in the dark side of the Force, and their new Sith Empire.</text>

The Sith had never forgotten their first exile from Republic space. With a trail unwittingly laid by the hyperspace explorer Jori Daragon, Sith Lord Naga Sadow saw a chance for revenge and to expand the borders of the Sith Empire. He had tricked the Sith Council into believing the Republic was about to attack and united several Sith factions into a massive invasion fleet. 

Meanwhile, Jori Daragon had done her best to warn the Republic of an impending Sith invasion, but only the warlord Empress Teta believed her. Teta was still gathering her armies when Sadow's entire fleet arrived in the Koros system and opened fire.

Jedi and Republic forces rallied quickly, but strengthened by Sith sorcery, Sadow's attacks were unpredictable and devastating. The conflict quickly spread throughout the galaxy, until even Coruscant was threatened. The Great Hyperspace War became the first conflict on a truly galactic scale.</text>

The Republic had enjoyed a long period of peace during the Manderon Period, but the Koros system was rapidly becoming a problem. Although the planet Koros Major was stable, growing wealthy on carbonite exports, the other six worlds of the system were poor and increasingly lawless.

The task of uniting the Koros system was accepted by a noble famed for her military achievements. Empress Teta was the heir to Koros Major and was determined that the rest of the Koros system would share its prosperity. To that end, Teta began the Unification Wars, hoping to bring the entire system under her rule. She was ultimately successful, though she had to fight a long and bloody campaign to conquer the planet Kirrek.

Empress Teta would become known as one of the Republic's boldest commanders. The Koros system was eventually renamed after her.</text>

During Marka Ragnos's funeral on Korriban, Sadow and Kressh fought a duel, each claiming he was more fit to be Dark Lord of the Sith--the then-unique title of the Empire's ultimate ruler. But the spirit of Ragnos himself appeared, claiming a golden age of the Sith was coming. Moments later, the funeral assembly was alerted: A Republic ship had been captured.

The ship belonged to two hyperspace explorers, the siblings Gav and Jori Daragon, who had stumbled on Korriban. As the Sith Council debated the Daragons' fate, Naga Sadow saw opportunity.

He then claimed to the Sith Council that Republic agents had freed the prisoners. Surely invasion was imminent?

Naga Sadow's rival, Ludo Kressh, grew suspicious. As Sadow began to train Gav Daragon as his protege, Kressh raised a force against Sadow, hoping to expose his treachery.

Its products cemented Balmorra's reputation as a producer of high-quality technology, and shortly before the Imperial invasion, the company built a new factory headquarters--at the time, declared the most state-of-the-art arms production and research facility in the galaxy.

When the Empire invaded, however, the Balmorran Arms Factory found a different purpose. The compound's massive walls and production facilities became the core of the Balmorran resistance effort, giving Republic troops and Balmorran soldiers an impenetrable fortress with a nearly endless supply of resources and weaponry. In the years since, the factory has been under constant siege, but has never fallen. Rumor has it that the resistance has even taken advantage of the factory's research facilities, developing devastating new technology to drive the Empire off Balmorra.</text>

Known originally as Lab 352, the genetic research facility came to be known as Bugtown when the Empire invaded. One of the Empire's many acts of sabotage involved releasing the results of Lab 352's biological experiments: the vicious, mutated Colicoids. The insects quickly overran the area, killing the facility's staff.

Since the initial invasion, the Colicoids have gradually spread from the Bugtown ruins out across the planet. Why the Balmorrans were mutating Colicoids is unknown--everyone behind the experiments seemingly died when the creatures were set free. Still, if answers are to be found, they will be found in Bugtown's databanks.</text>

One of these, Hazard Vault 305, was built into a pre-existing cave to collect the waste from the Balmorran Arms Factory; the Balmorran government did not suspect that the cave had been used by the Sith Lord Tulak Hord to hide one of his artifacts.

During the Imperial invasion of Balmorra, missile barrages damaged the hazard vault, causing its contents to leak and providing a way inside for anyone capable of surviving the deadly waste.</text>

The ChemWorks were destroyed in the Imperial bombardment of Balmorra, and the entire area surrounding the outpost is covered in pools of deadly chemical waste.

The toxic pools have been a boon to resistance defenders at the outpost--the choke points leading around the pools are well defended, making a large-scale assault impossible. Resistance fighters stationed at the outpost must rotate to other locations on Balmorra frequently, however: the long-term effects of exposure to the chemical waste are unknown.</text>

When the Empire invaded, its technicians uploaded a virus to the company's manufacturing center--the massive, automated Okara Droid factory--in hopes of turning the factory against the Balmorrans.

The virus worked too well, and the factory's defense droids and systems took over entirely, resuming production operations and attacking any and all life that came near. The Empire is currently making efforts to bring the factory under control, but so far has had little success.</text>

Ghost Town saw all its inhabitants massacred during the Imperial invasion.

Since then, the city of Sobrik has first shrunk, then been almost entirely obliterated by bombing runs and rebuilt by Imperial engineers.

Sobrik was one of the last cities to hold out during the Imperial invasion of the planet; because of this and its close proximity to the state-of-the-art Balmorran Arms and Okara Droid factories, the Empire has made Sobrik the headquarters of its occupation, maintaining tight control over the remaining civilian population.</text>

Its overseers are expected to worry about Imperial edicts first, and profit last.

Not surprisingly, its workers have been known in the past to harbor resistance sympathies. Nevertheless, its production remains strategically vital to the Imperial war effort, and caravans between Sobrik and Troida have been subjected to frequent guerrilla attacks by the resistance in an attempt to cut off the lifeblood of the Empire on Balmorra.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226881" version="1065353216">The Imperial military presence on Balmorra is understaffed and undersupplied. After the incredible success of the initial bombardment, the Imperial military has been harassed at every turn by Balmorran resistance fighters while more pressing conflicts elsewhere in the galaxy draw the attention of Imperial High Command.

The military makes its headquarters in Sobrik, where it is commanded by the thirteenth Imperial governor of Balmorra since the bombardment--along with those officers unfortunate enough to have been assigned to the military quagmire.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226883" version="1065353216">Balmorran Corporations</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226883" version="1065353216">Prior to the Empire's invasion, Balmorra was one of the galaxy's leading independent industrial worlds. It maintained a close relationship with the Republic, but remained aloof of most galactic struggles due to the strength of its corporations--including Okara, Balmorran Arms and Traken Industries. As a leading weapons and droid manufacturer, Balmorra was a corporate-run oligarchic democracy, centered on the capital of Bin Prime. 

The Empire took pains to leave the corporate hierarchies intact when the occupation began in an effort to smoothly transition back to full industrial production. Corporate executives who refused to cooperate were forcibly removed and replaced, and today's Balmorran corporations are puppets for the Empire--sometimes eager, often not.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226888" version="1065353216">While Colicoid society is not as rigidly hive-oriented as that of some insectoid species, Colicoid physiology ensures that a fertile queen will always hold a privileged position in life. Despite the fact that most Colicoid queens spend their lives being served tirelessly by their drones, workers and warriors, queens are extremely dangerous and often more than twice the size of even the largest warrior breeds.

Queens are also the only Colicoids to sport a unique poison stinger that--combined with their size and strength--make them the most deadly defenders of a nest. Fortunately, a queen will usually only fight when her young are threatened.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226891" version="1065353216">Balmorran Pollution</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226891" version="1065353216">As a thriving center of industry, Balmorra has never been a pollution-free planet and has grappled with the problem of waste produced by its many factories for many years. Still, unlike many of the similarly industrial Hutt worlds, Balmorra and its corporations have continually sought ways to safely dispose of its waste and keep the planet habitable.

For these reasons, facilities such as the Traken Waste Processing plant and the hazard vaults--a system of underground sealed storage facilities for toxic materials--were created. During the Imperial bombardment, however, many of these facilities were destroyed, releasing the toxic byproducts of Balmorran industry into the environment and destroying huge swathes of land.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226893" version="1065353216">Imperial Subjugation</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226893" version="1065353216">After the initial invasion of Balmorra, the Empire found itself facing immense opposition. Many former members of Balmorra's army remained on the planet in the form of a loosely organized resistance force, taking advantage of their superior numbers and knowledge of the terrain to wage an ongoing guerrilla war. Resistance soon came in other forms, as well: rebellious citizens, treacherous factory foremen, saboteurs posing as allies and terrorist cells all tried to thwart the Empire's attempts to fully control the industrial world. 

In response, the Empire has placed the territories it controls under strict lockdown, using a combination of propaganda and military policing to subjugate the unruly Balmorran population. Curfews are enforced and all citizens must apply for official IDs--a process that tests their loyalty to the Empire--or else be marked as resistance sympathizers and arrested. Punishments for attacks on Imperial infrastructure are regularly meted out against perpetrators' families, or even against the entire population; the lesson must be taught.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226894" version="1065353216">The Invasion of Balmorra</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226894" version="1065353216">The Empire launched a two-pronged attack on Balmorra during the war, believing Balmorra's weapons production facilities and proximity to the Core Worlds to be of great strategic importance. The first prong of the attack involved slicing and reprogramming the networked security systems that guarded the planet's factories, lab facilities and weaponry--in effect, turning Balmorra's defenses against itself.

The second prong was direct bombardment, aided by Balmorra's compromised orbital defense towers and satellites. This attack devastated the planet's primary military forces and central government, leaving a unified response nearly impossible.

Eventually, the Empire landed a full invasion force. By this time, the Republic had come to Balmorra's aid but was forced to abandon the planet with the Treaty of Coruscant--after which, the Imperial military declared victory and established its headquarters in Sobrik. The Balmorran resistance proved more wily than the Empire anticipated, however, and Balmorra's factories proved difficult to control, leading to a years-long morass in which the Empire is still mired.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226898" version="1065353216">Balmorran Resistance</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226898" version="1065353216">Since the Republic was forced to withdraw from Balmorra following the signing of the Treaty of Coruscant, the fight against the Empire has been carried out by a diverse group of native Balmorran resistance fighters. The resistance, led by many former members of the Balmorran army, has carried out repeated guerrilla strikes against Imperial forces, using their superior knowledge of the planet to harass the invaders.

Joined occasionally by mercenaries from sympathetic worlds and--according to popular rumor--supplied by the Republic, the resistance has single-handedly ensured that the Empire is unable to claim complete control of Balmorra, holding and fortifying such vital tactical locations as the Balmorran Arms Factory and Outpost Victory.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226901" version="1065353216">A highly intelligent and voracious insectoid race, Colicoids are relatively isolated in the galaxy, but their dedication to droid design and advanced technology have put them at the cutting edge of scientific research. They are not aggressive, strictly speaking, but they have little regard for other species despite their robust mercantile operations. To Colicoids, the technology trade is a useful means to an end... but a mildly distasteful one.

Dedicated also to the improvement of their own species, a group of Colicoids calling themselves the Creation Nest aided the establishment of an experimental facility for mutating their own kind in Balmorra's so-called &quot;Bugtown.&quot; They found that their mutated &quot;cousins&quot; were able to metabolize the toxic waste on the planet and made excellent, if unpredictable, weapons. The Colicoid emissaries were not deterred when Bugtown was overrun, hoping to continue to perfect the experiments in the future (albeit without the Balmorrans' aid).</text>

Traditionally highly communal, Gran found away from their home planets often stray from the stereotype; high-profile Gran outcasts have earned the species an unfair reputation as thugs, shady dealers and underworld enforcers. 

In reality, Gran appear in all walks of life--particularly within the Republic, where their generally calm demeanor, matched with their intimidating appearance, has made them excellent negotiators. This is not to say that all Gran are equally calm--one famous group of Gran gangsters was responsible for the deaths of thirteen rivals on Hutta after a fight over territory broke out in the local cantina.</text>

He manages the war from a distance, preoccupied with the Empire's other conflicts, but watches with a keen eye.

Ivernus was awarded the Empire's highest medal for planning Balmorra's initial invasion, and in spite of the ensuing quagmire, has continued to rise in esteem. As a target of the Great Hunt, he will not be easy to lure to the planet or to catch off guard.</text>

Until recently, only his son--a young Balmorran officer--has known his identity, but now he is in danger of being revealed by a Jedi Padawan with the peculiar and powerful ability to detect a person's true allegiance. Darth Baras sees a threat to one of his agents as a threat to his entire operation and has ordered that Commander Rylon be eliminated, along with his secret.</text>

Her successes in the Empire's battles have brought her to Balmorra, where she faces the challenge of putting down a resistance that has remained one step ahead of the military since the fight for the planet began.

Darth Lachris is sharp and wary, expecting a scheme behind every action her enemies take. Trained by Dark Council member Darth Marr, she is a warrior at heart with an embittered understanding of political necessity--and a lust for all the galaxy's bloody pleasures.</text>

Pirrell's service record in the Imperial Navy stands as a bland testament to the inevitability of a middling bureaucracy to exist anywhere; no matter where in the galaxy he was stationed, Pirrell always managed to find a position closest to the most influential members of command and farthest from any of the actual fighting.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226916" version="1065353216">Major Bessiker (Inquisitor)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226916" version="1065353216">A proud Imperial officer who rose to notoriety during the Sith's return to the galaxy, fighting with distinction at Coruscant and Begeren, Major Bessiker was made chief supply officer on Balmorra near the end of the war. As the Empire has provided fewer and fewer resources to support the ongoing pacification of Balmorra, Bessiker has almost single-handedly propped up the Imperial war effort, scavenging and repurposing old equipment and improvising armor and weaponry in a pinch.

Bessiker comes from a distinguished Imperial lineage, and in spite of his connections among the Sith--both his brother and his son trained on Korriban--Bessiker has never complained about his posting on Balmorra or the difficulty of his job.</text>

The tens of thousands of Imperials who serve as the espionage agency's backbone have a variety of ranks and maintain the daily flow of information from hundreds of worlds to the Citadel.

The position of station chief is a vital, if often unrewarding, rank within the Intelligence hierarchy. Station chiefs are posted to planets by Keeper or the Watchers and tasked with maintaining order and monitoring the population. It's a station chief's responsibility to make sure suspicious activity is reported, to use his or her resources to contain local threats, and to support the Sith, the military and the Ministry of Logistics.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226918" version="1065353216">The remains of an old swoop track, Brejik's Run is named for Milos Brejik, a famous Tarisian swoop racer who turned scavenger after the destruction of Taris, using his swoop skills to quickly forage and deliver supplies to the few unfortunate survivors of the bombardment. Brejik's Run has had many occupants over the centuries, as its large overhangs make good shelter from the harsh elements, but it currently hosts a Republic settlement and outpost--one of the earliest attempts to tame and rebuild Taris.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226921" version="1065353216">The Brell Sediment refers to a large area of Tarisian ruins dominated by a massive acidic lake and a former chemical plant. It gets its name--somewhat ironically--from Ark Brell, a leading environmentalist on Taris in the days before its destruction. Before the bombardment, Ark Brell set up several water purification and waste disposal plants on Taris, with the aim of turning the waste from Taris's factories into alternative fuel sources and minimizing the waste produced by the massive city-world.

Legend has it that the collapse of one of his factories during the bombardment created the acid lake, although present rumor suggests that other, less well-intentioned groups on Taris may be the cause.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226923" version="1065353216">Dynamet General was Taris's foremost research hospital and led the galaxy in the development of cures for rare neurological diseases such as Cathington's Disorder. Originally founded as Mercy General, the hospital was renamed a century before Taris's destruction after the Dynamet Corporation, which donated a large sum of credits for the construction of a wing devoted to developing a cure for the rakghoul virus. Rumor states that a cure was found, but Taris was bombed shortly after and the hospital destroyed.</text>

This event led directly to Taris's ultimate destruction, securing the ship's place in history.

Over the centuries, the Endar Spire's husk has become a shelter to many different groups on Taris, including surviving settlers, pirates and scavengers. Its internal systems are believed to contain a bounty of information and useful materials to anyone with the will and ability to recover them.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226925" version="1065353216">As part of its efforts to rebuild and restore ruined Taris, the Republic has set up a reclamation base that acts as the headquarters and point of arrival for all who come to help with the reconstruction effort. The base was first established shortly after the Treaty of Coruscant, when it became clear that the Republic needed to shore up morale and show it could still stand strong. The Taris reclamation effort has become symbolic of the Republic's will to restore life where the Empire brings only destruction.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226926" version="1065353216">The Sinking City is where the heart of old Taris collapsed into the world below during the bombardment. Taris's most lively business and cultural districts have become a morass of urban decay. The ruins of Dynamet General Hospital, as well as massive building plates that once supported towering skyscrapers, provide shelter for rakghouls, pirates and scavengers. But the Sinking City promises to rise again--several attempts have been made to begin new construction in the area, and the Republic is focusing its reconstruction efforts on returning Taris to its former glory.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226927" version="1065353216">Tularan Marsh</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226927" version="1065353216">Swampland has overtaken much of the area now called the Tularan Marsh. The origin of the name is unknown--before the bombardment, the Tularan Skyway was a major thoroughfare through the industrial zone surrounding one of Taris's primary power plants, but who or what it was named after is a piece of history lost in the rubble.

Now the area is infested with rakghouls and pirates, and only a few intrepid representatives of the Republic venture this far into the unknown, untamed wilds of Taris.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226929" version="1065353216">Environment of Taris</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226929" version="1065353216">Before Darth Malak's orbital bombardment, Taris was a dying world. Industrial pollution had irreparably damaged the oceans, and chemicals and toxins poisoned the undercity's foundation. When the sprawling metropolis was reduced to rubble, countless pollutants were released into an already tainted ecosystem.

But this was not the end for Taris. For hundreds of years, the planet went without sentient interference, and the ecosystem began to adapt and thrive. Rich vegetation grew within the ruins, scaling steel towers and thrusting aside fallen skyscrapers. Animals--some native to the planet, some pets and lab specimens that had survived the bombardment--bred and repopulated the developing jungles.

Of course, some areas remain too polluted to inhabit--acidic lakes and radioactive sinkholes--but for the most part, Taris is an environmental success story and an object of fascination for scientists. The largest black mark remains the rakghoul plague, and the fear that it may one day spread to Taris's animal population.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226952" version="1065353216">Also known as the Second Sith War and the War of the Star Forge, the Jedi Civil War is one of the darkest eras in galactic history. Three centuries ago, a pair of idealistic young Jedi named Revan and Malak led thousands of followers into the Outer Rim to do battle with an invading Mandalorian army. The Mandalorians were defeated--and Revan and Malak returned to the Republic not as heroes, but as conquerors.

Declaring themselves Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Revan and Darth Malak began the ruthless subjugation of Republic worlds in the Outer Rim. The Jedi Council, which had been loath to take action against the Mandalorians, assembled an army to bring the traitors to justice. Darth Revan was captured during an attack by the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan and eventually turned back to the light side. Together Revan and Bastila defeated Malak, ending the threat.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226953" version="1065353216">Rakghoul Disease</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226953" version="1065353216">Theories abound on the origins of this highly contagious and adaptable virus: it may be the creation of an ancient Sith Lord; a naturally occurring result of the industrial toxins released into Taris's oceans; or the spectacularly failed efforts of medical researchers to artificially engineer a broad-spectrum vaccine.

Whatever the origins, the effects are undeniably terrifying. Typically spread through direct contact with rakghouls, fortunate victims suffer acute onset of flu-like symptoms that can prove fatal if not properly treated. However, in roughly half the cases the disease causes the host to undergo a horrific mutation, actually transforming them into a rakghoul.

Virtually all humanoid species in the galaxy are susceptible to infection, and there are rumors that the Empire has undertaken efforts to weaponize the disease. Unsubstantiated reports of rakghouls on worlds other than Taris lend credence to this rumor... or indicate the disease is slowly spreading across the galaxy of its own accord.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226954" version="1065353216">Malak's Attack</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226954" version="1065353216">During the Jedi Civil War, a ship carrying Bastila Shan--a Jedi with the rare and powerful battle meditation ability--was shot down by Darth Malak's fleet over the world of Taris. Malak's troops descended on the world in search of Bastila, but she avoided capture with the help of Revan, Malak's redeemed former master.

Rather than permit Bastila to escape, Malak ordered his fleet to bomb Taris from orbit, devastating the entire world. The planet-wide capital city was razed and civilian casualties measured in the billions. Despite Malak's extreme efforts, Bastila and Revan were able to safely flee the world. Taris itself, however, never recovered. Three centuries have passed, and a handful of swamp-sunken ruins are all that remains of this once great civilization.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226955" version="1065353216">In the century preceding its destruction by Darth Malak, Taris experienced a devastating planet-wide famine among the working classes. In desperation, the poor declared war on the nobility, only to have their rebellion quickly and violently put down.

Since many of the rebellions' leaders were nonhuman immigrants, those in power sought to quell further unrest by enacting a number of harsh anti-alien laws. Nonhumans were banned from public office and forbidden to leave the lower levels of the city without special government permits. The institutionalized segregation of nonhumans inevitably fostered an anti-alien prejudice among the human population, though many Republic historians prefer to gloss over this unsavory fact.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="226956" version="1065353216">Taris (Pre-bombardment)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226956" version="1065353216">Located in the Ojoster Sector of the Outer Rim Territories, Taris was an ecumenopolis founded at the nexus of several hyperspace trading routes. Prosperity led to a rapid population increase and the continued vertical expansion of the planet-wide urban sprawl. But with the discovery of superior trade lanes elsewhere, Taris's economic fortunes changed.

For the wealthy nobles living in the upper floors of the towering skyscrapers, Taris remained an urban paradise. As one descended, however, the standard of living dropped precipitously. Aliens and refugees were forced to live in the city's lower levels, supporting the upper classes both figuratively and literally. Near the surface, violent swoop gangs held sway over a terrified civilian populace beset by poverty and famine, and the sewers of the undercity were infested with rakghouls.

Ironically, many of those living in the lowest levels of Taris survived Darth Malak's bombardment, while the rich and powerful were almost entirely wiped out.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226957" version="1065353216">Although located on the Outer Rim, Taris was once a cosmopolitan cityscape said to rival Coruscant. But this shining light was snuffed out three hundred years ago by Darth Malak, who ordered his Sith fleet to bomb the planet into oblivion. In the aftermath of the attack, little remained but ruins and putrid swamps overrun by rakghouls. 

Recently, the Republic has begun efforts to recolonize and restore Taris in the belief it will demonstrate a resolve and ability to overcome the destruction wrought by the Sith. Should this lost world be salvaged, it would become a symbol of hope for all those who stand against the oppression of the Empire.

The focus to date has been on cleanup, salvage and clearing sites for new colonies. Progress has been slow, and the morale of those stationed on the world is rumored to be dangerously low. But the Galactic Senate refuses to admit defeat, truly exemplifying the politicians' can-do spirit.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226958" version="1065353216">The Promised Ones were the descendants of a small group of outcasts who fled the undercity of Taris for a self-sustaining underground colony known as the Promised Land. There they escaped the bombardment that decimated the surface of the planet, and survived for many generations.

As the centuries passed, however, the small tribe slowly lost members to rakghouls, starvation and radiation poisoning until they eventually died out completely. As a legacy, they left behind a series of holorecordings documenting their brave struggle.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226963" version="1065353216">One of the key elements in the Republic effort to restore Taris to its former glory is the establishment of a small Cathar colony on the planet's surface. Coming from a homeworld ravaged by war, the Cathar species has come to symbolize the Republic's resilience and fortitude in the face of overwhelming odds... much like Taris itself.

Officially, the colony has the full support of the Galactic Senate--yet key infrastructure is still lacking, and the settlers always seem to be low on supplies. Recently, some have questioned whether the colonization efforts began too soon, pushed forward by self-serving politicians looking to exploit the brave Cathar settlers to further their own agendas.</text>

One of the most vocal opponents of the Sith, she has openly called for the complete eradication of the Empire on numerous occasions.

Perhaps because of her uncompromising views, she was granted the governorship of Taris--a post that has destroyed more than one promising political career. Unlike her predecessors, however, Saresh has embraced the seemingly impossible situation, throwing all her considerable resources at the myriad problems of the ravaged world.

Should she achieve any kind of success on Taris it would be seen as a remarkable achievement, giving a major boost to her already impressive political profile.</text>

She has since served with distinction as a search-and-rescue squad leader, earning several commendations for aiding wounded men under direct enemy fire. Her operational record is flawless.

What no record can show is that Dorne's background, combined with her strict adherence to regulations and rigid, uncompromising personality, has made her fairly unpopular with her fellow soldiers. In truth, she's widely regarded as a cold, asocial killjoy, an unfortunate side effect of her dedication to embodying the laws and ideals of the Republic.

This has given her a reputation for being unlucky to work for, but that's probably just spacer superstition.

Rumors persist of Beryl's shady past and brief stay at an Imperial prison, but she has operated as a legitimate business owner for years. That doesn't mean Beryl hasn't had her share of run-ins with Republic law enforcement--only that the charges never seem to stick. Whether through guile or genuine innocence, Beryl always remains a step ahead of the law.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="226971" version="1065353216">Even his detractors admit that Doctor Nasan Godera was born a genius. As a young man, he was impatient and intolerant of &quot;lesser intellects&quot; and was never shy about making his blunt opinions known to all. His abrasive, politically insensitive attitude would have doomed his career if he hadn't made himself indispensible to the Republic's war effort. 

Doctor Godera was behind some of the greatest scientific breakthroughs in the Republic, including some of its most deadly superweapons. He was notorious for his strong conviction that the Sith Empire must be utterly annihilated without mercy, and his weapons were designed to fulfill that dogmatic belief. When the Republic signed a peace treaty with the Empire after the sacking of Coruscant, Doctor Godera angrily abandoned the Republic for its cowardice and disappeared. He remained hidden for many years, but eventually his network of hideouts was discovered on the shattered world of Taris.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="227662" version="1065353216">Valuable treasures lay buried in the ruins of Taris, attracting a wide range of individuals and groups willing to brave the dangers and claim a small piece of the fallen city's vast wealth. Most of these can be loosely categorized as either scavengers or pirates.

Scavengers tend to stake out a small section of the ruins and generally avoid military confrontation, although they frequently ambush civilians passing through areas they have &quot;claimed&quot; or pillage choice sectors after a Republic cleanup crew has sorted out the debris.

In contrast, pirates are far more aggressive. Traveling in armed bands, they typically attack on sight. Some of the larger pirate bands, like the Death's Claw, have been known to brutalize small settlements and armed patrols if they have superior numbers and position.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="231953" version="1065353216">Stretches of sand pockmarked by canyons and rocky outcroppings, the Jundland Wastes mark the border between the great Dune Sea and the spaceports of Anchorhead and Mos Ila. Home to a scattered few outposts and moisture farms along with Sand People, wild beasts and the kind of criminal scum unwelcome even in Tatooine's most disreputable settlements, the intense heat is far from the only danger. 

Jundland's cliffs are festooned with cave systems extending kilometers below ground, but mechanical problems related to the pervasive heat and sand mean they have never been properly mapped. Every once in a while, a brave individual builds a permanent shelter inside one of these caves. There's rarely anything left after a month, thanks to the predators of Jundland.</text>

The Lightspring is a huge underground cavern containing a massive pool of water lit from beneath by a strange glow, casting rippling shadows and reflections on the walls. It's considered a holy site by the native Sand People, never to be disturbed or contaminated.

Now, the sanctity of the Lightspring has been desecrated by the crime lord Diago Hixan, who has claimed it as the seat of his criminal empire. He's filled the cavern with his vain collection of trinkets and baubles, turning the once-pristine landmark into his personal junkyard.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="231957" version="1065353216">One of the first outsider settlements built on Tatooine, Anchorhead started as a desperate mining colony and has, over the centuries, grown into one of the largest spaceports on the planet. Anchorhead plays host to pirates and smugglers looking for a place to lie low, merchants and businessmen integral to the survival of the city's outlying moisture farms, and permanent residents who eke out a living running cantinas, fixing machines and otherwise maintaining the cultural infrastructure.

The mining industry has faded away altogether in and around Anchorhead. It was Czerka Corporation that was most resolved to unearth valuable metals several centuries ago, and even after it became clear that no profit was forthcoming, Czerka maintained offices in Anchorhead on and off for centuries--committed not to write the planet off as a total loss.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="231958" version="1065353216">Before the Empire converted the city into a garrison, Mos Ila was a settlement largely overrun by Exchange outlaws and smugglers. The local farmers and traders who made up the bulk of the population were at the mercy of the crime syndicate, which found Tatooine to be a perfect base of operations. When Imperial troops landed unannounced and swept all opposition out of the city, the residents reacted with mixed emotion--glad to see the Exchange gone, less certain of their new Imperial masters.

This is not the first time Mos Ila's local authority has been deposed. The settlement was originally built as a trading post with the assistance of local Jawas and was governed by a Jawa council. The non-Jawa population had no problem with this arrangement, despite the unpredictability of the Jawa-built machines; rather, it was the arrival of the Exchange that forced the Jawas out and soured outsider-Jawa relations in the region.</text>

Few dare to wander too far into the wasteland, fearful of Sand People, hideous monsters and worst of all: the utterly unknown.

Particularly brave Jawas have retrieved salvage during journeys into the Dune Sea, returning with puzzling devices and broken gadgets. No one is entirely sure how these scraps ended up in the wastes, but the occasional piece bears the worn, faded emblem of Czerka Corporation.</text>

The bottom is impossible to see from the upper ridge, and the rim of the Wound is dotted with the camps of Sand People. The Sand People seem to revere the Wound and are occasionally seen casting the dead into its depths.

Most people consider the Wound a natural formation, but some fringe geologists believe otherwise. They speculate the Wound was created during a violent orbital bombardment in ancient times. Their evidence is thin, however, and many wonder why anyone would bombard such a remote and desolate world.</text>

The Lady's personal pits may pale in comparison to the glorious arenas of her homeworld, but they may be the deadliest place on Tatooine if measured by lives lost per square meter.

When the Lady isn't indulging in her favorite pastime, she acts as an iron-fisted taskmaster of the Exchange on Tatooine--a fact that explains why the criminal organization is so motivated in defending its interests on the planet.</text>

Xenobiologists estimate the lifespan of an average sarlacc to be anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 years, with virtually all of that time being spent at a single location. 

Sarlaccs typically bury themselves deep below the ground so that only their great mouths are exposed, making them virtually invulnerable to standard weapons. The mouth resembles a massive pit lined with spiny protrusions. From the center, long tentacles can lash out to grasp prey near the edges of the pit, dragging it down into the creature's stomach where the unfortunate victim is slowly digested. Victims may survive for a period of weeks or months, kept alive by the sarlacc's unique stomach fluids, but total digestion can take centuries.</text>

Operational Summary: Informant (Mia Hawkins) contacted Intelligence from inside elite terrorist organization &quot;ghost cell&quot; and agreed to help dismantle the organization. Cipher Nine located ghost cell training grounds and eliminated the leader, known as the &quot;Old Man,&quot; despite enemy attempts to replace the Cipher with a disguised ghost cell operative.

Notes: The ghost cell's training techniques are exceptional. See associated files for details; however, be aware that not all ghost cell operatives were identified during this sweep. Individuals able to use the cell's holographic disguise technology may still be active elsewhere, appearing as anyone.

Sufferers develop a distinctive cough and begin to lose feeling in their hands and fingers. Sand Rot is treatable, preferably by taking the sufferer offworld, but few on Tatooine can afford the expense. 

Many have wondered if Tatooine's native Sand People can catch the Sand Rot, as they never leave the desert wastes. Although it is difficult to know for certain, some desert guides believe the Sand People's distinctive masks and wrappings protect against the sickness and will pay good credits for intact garb.</text>

To that end, Jedi sometimes leave the order and live as part of another culture, often for years at a time, to learn its customs and study its languages. This cultural immersion follows a key tenet of Jedi diplomatic policy: To be reasonable, one must see all points of view.

Such immersion carries its dangers. Some Jedi have lost their lives undergoing rites of passage or by accidentally offending a rigidly polite alien society. The Jedi Order looks on these losses somberly as hard-earned lessons. However, most Jedi return with new skills and a fresh perspective on life. A few bring unusual habits or tastes, as well; after decades living in a Kubaz hive, for example, Master Arjur developed a craving for dried moon moths.</text>

Such ritual imbuement can be used to inflict all manner of trouble on those who would steal these terrible treasures.

The Dark Lord of the Sith Tulak Hord was especially known for this practice, and many possessions of Tulak Hord's have driven their discoverers to madness throughout the years. Tulak's Madness is unique in who it affects, however; ignoring whether a person's spirit is dark or light, it afflicts only the weak-willed, driving them to delusions of grandeur and eventual self-destruction.</text>

Designed to emit a series of sonic bursts, the initial stages of activation disable droids and other electronics in an ever-widening circle with the Shock Drum at the epicenter. 

The sonic bursts become progressively more intense, with the second stage causing damage and even death to organic life. Left unchecked, the ever-stronger vibrations of the Shock Drum can eventually destabilize a planetary core, causing a world to literally fracture.</text>

Slaying one of the fearsome beasts was once a rite of passage for young Sand People warriors, and the Jawa believe krayt bones possess mystical properties.

For all their importance to Tatooine's native cultures, however, krayt dragons are extraordinarily rare and quite possibly extinct--no living krayt has been seen in decades. Nonetheless, their towering skeletons are a testament to their power and majesty, and a pilgrimage to the legendary krayt graveyard remains a holy ritual in many Sand People tribes.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="232927" version="1065353216">History of Tatooine</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="232927" version="1065353216">Thirty thousand years ago, Tatooine was the lush, vibrant homeworld of the Kumumgah--a technologically advanced species believed to have been wiped out in a forgotten war. Ultimately, the war ended with Tatooine's devastation by one faction or another--the details are long since lost. 

Most researchers aware of the story believe the Kumumgah were wiped out in the attack that transformed their planet into a desert wasteland. However, some xenosociologists believe the Jawas and Sand People who dwell in the dunes may be descended from the world's original rulers. The stories of the Jawas and Sand People themselves, however, are largely confused and contradictory.

Human settlement of Tatooine came much later, but colonization never truly took hold despite several efforts by the Republic (including a brief period during which Tatooine was considered a Republic protectorate, and a failed attempt by Czerka Corporation to set up planetary mining operations). The native population had little use for outsiders, and so the world became a haven for pirates, smugglers and general scum seeking a place to disappear.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="232928" version="1065353216">Oleg Klerren retired to the dusty town of Anchorhead on the remote world of Tatooine after working for decades as a merchant pilot and trader. But years spent in action across the galaxy left Klerren restless in retirement, so he gradually took on an increasing number of civic positions around town to stay busy.

Klerren's straightforward approach and can-do attitude quickly earned him a reputation as someone people could rely on, and he was astonished to find himself elected mayor without even entering the running. Flattered and humbled by the trust shown to him by his neighbors, Klerren approached the position with his standard determination and resourcefulness and has been re-elected by a landslide in every election since.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="232929" version="1065353216">For five notorious years, the pirate Andronikos Revel terrorized Republic and Imperial space alike as the captain of the Sky Princess. Known for his sharp temper and sharper flying skills, Revel was one of the few pirate captains to serve as his own pilot.

His piracy career was cut short by a strange mutiny, however, and he was abandoned to the Imperials who had been hunting him since he'd raided a ship carrying valuable artifacts. After a year in Imperial prison, Andronikos Revel was let loose. He has been meticulously hunting and killing the mutineers who betrayed him ever since.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="232930" version="1065353216">A Sith pureblood, Lord Praven has trained in the ways of the Force since the earliest years of his youth. Fiercely loyal to the Emperor and an ardent believer in the philosophical teachings of the dark side, Praven is surprisingly calm and collected in his speech and actions.

He follows a strict code of personal honor, and unlike many other Sith, he eschews random acts of cruelty and sadism. Despite this, he is sworn to destroy the Jedi and considers them his mortal enemies.

During the Sacking of Coruscant, Lord Praven killed Master Usma--one of the Jedi's most famous duelists--in an epic battle. But he spared Usma's young Padawan, telling her to seek him out once she had finished her training so they could face each other as equals. When she tracked him down years later, he honored his promise, sending her to the same fate as her Master.</text>

Their rivalry spanned many years and countless worlds as they scored bigger heists and hunted rarer treasures, punctuated by the occasional spat of violence. Diago Hixan claimed victory after Nok Drayen died, bringing many cunning and merciless criminals throughout the galaxy under his heel.

In his prime, one of Diago Hixan's greatest treasures was the beautiful Shassa Dalle. To his dismay, she was eventually &quot;stolen&quot; by none other than Nok Drayen. For years Diago Hixan made many impassioned attempts to take her back from his rival, but his pursuit ended after he accidentally caused Shassa's death.</text>

He has long been the very model of the Jedi Code, a master of his emotions and unafraid of death. Older now, the Force is still strong with him, and he has many years of wisdom and experience behind him.

It was when Nomen Karr brought his Padawan to Master Yonlach that her mysterious gift first manifested. Through Yonlach's training, he developed a strong bond with the Padawan and believes she will use her abilities to someday lead the Jedi to greatness.</text>

War-like and cruel, strong in the Force and technologically advanced, they enslaved or wiped out every civilization they encountered. At its peak, nearly five hundred conquered worlds paid tribute to the Rakata Infinite Empire.

However, the Rakata's rapid expansion came to an abrupt end when a strange plague swept through the species. Millions died, and most of those who survived lost their connection to the Force. Suddenly vulnerable, the Rakata were unable to suppress a massive outbreak of violent slave uprisings. 

The liberated worlds destroyed the creations and records of their defeated overlords, wiping out almost all trace and knowledge of the Rakata in the greater galaxy. A few thousand Rakata survivors--all that remained of the Infinite Empire--retreated to their hidden homeworld of Lehon, where they descended into barbarism.</text>

On their homeworld, they live in clans, where the male boars serve exclusively as warriors while the female sows tend the day-to-day affairs like farming, raising young and crafting weapons.

Known for their physical strength and endurance, Gamorreans are generally considered a species of below average intelligence. Unable to speak Basic because of their physiology, most Gamorreans are still able to comprehend it and find a place in the galactic community as soldiers, guards or mercenaries. Due to their reputation for violence and brutality, they are often employed by crime lords, gang leaders and various other criminal elements.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="233393" version="1065353216">An insectoid species with physiologically distinct subgroups, most Geonosians are four-limbed bipeds. Often categorized as cruel and barbaric, they possess an inherent talent for engineering and technical design and a complex set of cultural traditions.

On their homeworld, the Geonosians live in hierarchical hive societies broken down into castes. The Geonosian aristocracy has unquestioned control of the workers and the soldiers, brutally managing the lesser castes as befits the aristocrats' whims. Rebellion is nearly unthinkable, given the Geonosian instinct for hive preservation, and advancement in the hive is extremely difficult--often earned through ritual gladiatorial combat. Rumors of a queen caste arise among outsiders periodically, but if queens exist, the Geonosians keep them well hidden.

Most Geonosians encountered away from their homeworld are outcasts or warrior scouts; either way, they are typically arrogant and selfish, with little regard for the lives of other species.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="233395" version="1065353216">Native to Tatooine, the diminutive Jawas are often dismissed as scavengers and thieves. However, this description minimizes the resilience of the species, which has managed to thrive in the harsh desert environment.

Rodent-like in their features, Jawa are rarely seen without the brown robes and facial coverings that protect them from Tatooine's twin suns. They live in nomadic clans each ruled by a female shaman, and there is surprisingly little rivalry between the clans, as each limits scavenging to its traditional territory. Necessities not found or built by the clan are purchased from offworlders' settlements, where Jawas' skills as tinkerers whose work endures the desert heat are reluctantly valued.

Annually, all the clans gather in the basin of the Dune Sea to exchange goods and share ideas. This is also a common time for clans to exchange sons and daughters of age. This practice increases genetic diversity within each clan and solidifies the unspoken alliance among the Jawas as a whole.</text>

Most at home in Tatooine's endless deserts and canyons, the nomadic Sand People survive by hunting and raiding larger settlements and by raising banthas as mounts and for food, milk and materials. To outsiders, they can appear incomprehensibly hostile--but while virtually all encounters with Sand People end in violence, their culture is more complex internally.

Sand People have strict taboos against showing exposed flesh except in very rare and specific circumstances and keep themselves wrapped in heavy coverings. Those who violate this sacred custom are banished from the tribe; a fate that typically ends in a lonely death in the desert. Despite their insular nature, Sand People are known to adopt and raise young children of other species orphaned by their attacks. Once these orphans reach adulthood, they are encouraged to leave the tribe and return to their own people.

The history of the Sand People is maintained through the tales of revered tribal storytellers. Many of their legends describe a golden age of technological miracles, seemingly indicating the Sand People were once a highly advanced civilization. This had led to speculation that the Ghorfa are descended from the now extinct Kumumgah species that lived on Tatooine roughly thirty thousand years ago.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="233427" version="1065353216">The ghost cell is an urban legend in the intelligence community--an explanation or an excuse for disasters otherwise inexplicable. Rumors describe an organization on a remote planet somewhere in the galaxy devoted to the training and education of master killers--an organization that seeks out radicals and terrorists in order to further develop their abilities, to help assassins and saboteurs turn their talents into art. Once trained, ghost cell operatives are returned to the galaxy to wreak havoc, disguised as the men and women they kill and capable of bringing down planetary governments. 

Neither Imperial Intelligence nor the Strategic Information Service has ever found proof of the ghost cell's existence. The only reason the legend has any credibility is its recurrence--different informants spread across known space have spoken of its existence. None of these informants survived long enough to be debriefed.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="233429" version="1065353216">The greatest strength of the Empire comes not in the form of weapons or armies, but in the awesome power of the dark side. Understanding this, the Dark Council created the Imperial Reclamation Service to scour the galaxy in search of legendary Sith artifacts. Since its early days, the service has expanded its mission to include any ancient object, technological or religious, from any culture--so long as it empowers the Empire.

Technically a division of the military, the Reclamation Service is comprised of a mix of scholars and archaeologists working alongside experienced officers given a crash course in history. Although sometimes regarded with suspicion or derision by the rank-and-file soldiers, the Sith Lords and senior officials understand the Reclamation Service has the potential to single-handedly change the galactic struggle.

On Imperial-controlled worlds, the service has the resources and authority to oversee massive excavations if evidence suggests valuable artifacts may be unearthed. On neutral and Republic-aligned worlds, however, they must rely on covert methods to claim lost treasures before they fall into the hands of the enemy.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="233431" version="1065353216">A loose affiliation of pirates, smugglers and thugs, the Twin Suns are found almost exclusively on the desert world of Tatooine. Those who join the Twin Suns typically fall into two categories: independents and exiles. 

Independents are individuals or small gangs seeking protection from more established criminal organizations like the Exchange or the Hutt Cartel. Exiles are former members of these established syndicates that have been forced out for reasons ranging from suspected betrayal to mental instability to simply choosing the wrong side in a power struggle.

The Twin Suns rely on brinksmanship to offset their small numbers. Reacting to even the smallest perceived threat to their people or territory with a completely inappropriate level of violent response has convinced larger criminal organizations to mostly avoid them. Should the Twin Suns try to expand beyond Tatooine, however, they would quickly be crushed by their much stronger rivals.</text>

Once an outpost of the ancient Sith Empire, the planet Dromund Kaas now presented a refuge to the Empire's weary survivors after their long exile from Korriban. Upon landing, the Emperor addressed the populace, promising them that from this world, a new civilization would grow to eventually crush the Republic. 

The challenges of colonizing such a wild planet were soon evident. Dromund Kaas's jungles were untamed, full of dangerous predators. To ensure order and discipline, military service became mandatory for non-Force sensitives. Imperial citizens took pride in this duty, knowing they were defending the future of their people.

Before withdrawing into isolation, the Emperor established a Dark Council to oversee the Empire and control the hierarchy of the Sith. He is said to have conducted many dark side rituals and experiments that affected the planet itself, leaving Dromund Kaas storm-wracked to this day.</text>

The fallen Jedi Freedon Nadd learned well at the feet of Naga Sadow, an ancient Sith Lord. After killing his mentor, Nadd traveled to distant Onderon and established himself in the capital Iziz as a tyrant, twisting the city's culture to a Sith ideal. 

Nadd would often banish criminals beyond Iziz's walls, intending for them to die in Onderon's dangerous jungles. However, many of these criminals survived and began taming the jungle beasts as mounts. These &quot;Beast Riders&quot; formed a guerrilla force that eventually went to war against Iziz. Nadd fought them fiercely, but the jungle had honed the Beast Riders into formidable enemies. 

The civil war continued even after Nadd's eventual death. Nadd was entombed below the city of Iziz, where his influence on Iziz's rulers would be felt for centuries.</text>

In the years after the Great Hyperspace War, a discovery was made on the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth--the spice called ryll. Ryll was a component in several medicines, but was also a powerful stimulant. Sensing opportunity, Neimoidian traders quickly gained a monopoly on ryll and were keen to introduce it to other species.

One of these species was the Porporites, a peaceful people who had recently made first contact with the Republic. But in contrast to other species, ryll drove the Porporites into homicidal fury. Eventually, the entire species was composed of raging maniacs who began attacking other worlds. 

Alarmed, the Republic asked the Jedi to take action against the Porporites, but the intervention was unsuccessful. The Neimoidians, fearing for their livelihoods, decided more desperate measures might be necessary and turned to Gank mercenaries for help.</text>

Addicted to the spice ryll--which drove them into a murderous frenzy--the Porporite species had become a threat to the galaxy. The Neimoidians had a monopoly on ryll and, terrified of the coming Porporite swarm, turned to the Ganks to stop the Porporites quickly. 

The Ganks were mysterious, cybernetic mercenaries that often worked for the Hutts. With the Ganks' reputation as cold-blooded killers, the Neimoidians were confident they could handle the Porporite armies. But the Ganks' solution was to eliminate the entire Porporites species, and they hunted the Porporites to extinction. 

Encouraged by this &quot;success,&quot; the Ganks began wiping out other species, quickly becoming a far greater threat than the Porporites. The Jedi took up arms against them, but Supreme Chancellor Vocatara was forced to commission the first juggernaut droids to end the Gank menace for good.</text>

Although the Quarren and Mon Calamari both evolved on the watery world of Dac, it was millennia before the two species encountered each other. Unfortunately, initial contact went badly and the Quarren declared war. The Mon Calamari had a technological and intellectual advantage, but the Quarren repeatedly refused any overtures of peace. Eventually, the Quarren were driven to near-extinction.

But the Mon Calamari had no wish to exterminate their cousins. In a bold social experiment, the Mon Calamari took young Quarren into their society and taught them civilization, mathematics and the sciences. When these young Quarren returned to their people, they had nothing in common with their primitive fellows. Within twenty years, they had become the dominant force in Quarren society, and eventually sought peace with the Mon Calamari.</text>

Trained at the Jedi Temple on Ossus centuries after the Great Hyperspace War, Freedon Nadd was a powerful but temperamental Padawan. When denied promotion to the rank of Jedi Knight, the enraged Nadd struck down his Master. He left the Jedi and began to study the powers of the dark side. 

Although Nadd learned much from a Sith holocron, he craved more. Nadd traveled to Yavin Four where he encountered the Massassi, savages who were once servants of the Sith Lord Naga Sadow. Nadd defeated them easily, and the awestruck Massassi took him to Sadow, who rested in a suspended animation chamber.

Unaware of the Sith Empire rebuilding itself on Dromund Kaas, Sadow believed Nadd was the acolyte he had been waiting for. But he underestimated Nadd's craving for power, and Nadd soon killed Sadow and left Yavin Four behind. Nadd settled on the distant world of Onderon, becoming a legendary tyrant.</text>

These Dark Jedi began exploring their new home and discovered massive, ancient machines that spoke of an extraordinary discovery. The Vultar system appeared to have been artificially constructed; these machines were clearly relics of the long-forgotten Architects who had built it.

Eager for revenge on the Jedi Order, the Dark Jedi sought to use these machines, including the device they called the &quot;Cosmic Turbine.&quot; But the machines were far beyond their ability to control.

Czerka was already planning to exploit Kashyyyk's resources when corporate scouts encountered the native Wookiee population. Although physically strong and agile, the Wookiees were forced to fall back before Czerka's superior technology. 

It didn't take Czerka long to realize that the true wealth of Kashyyyk was the Wookiees themselves.

However, a &quot;droid rights&quot; movement began to find a voice across the Republic and quickly became popular on Coruscant. The argument was made that since droids had personalities and sentience, owning a droid was tantamount to slavery.

The Galactic Senate dismissed the movement as a mere fad, but after millions of appeals to create a Droid Rights Bill, they were forced to address the issue. A surprising number of Senators spoke up in favor of droid rights, while many others dismissed the idea as absurd.

Some years before the Old Sith Wars, the Nevoota--a species of insectoid aliens from the Balmorra system--found themselves facing an army of disciplined warriors in distinctive armor. The warriors were Mandalorian Crusaders, testing themselves against the galaxy's deadliest species.

However, the Nevoota were a challenge even for the Mandalorians. Possessing superior numbers and utterly disdainful of death, the Nevoota fought a four-year campaign under the cunning warlord Ithcharaka--but finally the Mandalorians hunted the Nevoota to extinction.

This conflict had a profound effect on Mandalorian culture. The Mandalorians began to see war itself as an end, not just a means of conquest. Through war, Mandalorian society found its highest expression. When Mandalore the Indomitable eventually rose to power, he led a people who demanded nothing less than the greatest challenges the galaxy could offer.</text>

There is no cargo that can't be offloaded here and no job so dirty that someone won't take it. The families of migrant workers live alongside grizzled Republic veterans who settled on Nar Shaddaa to retire in style, happily turning a blind eye to the darker activities around them.

Over the past decade, the gangs and pirates of the Corellian Sector have become overshadowed by the presence of the Exchange. Once a group mentioned primarily in HoloNet information crime reports, the Exchange crime syndicate has found an army of able recruits on Nar Shaddaa willing to back its slicers and spice-refiners with muscle--much to the dismay of the Hutt Cartel.</text>

The Empire operates a series of front corporations out of Nar Shaddaa, concentrated in the lower levels.

The Hutt Cartel also maintains an interest in the sector --buildings not leased to the Empire store spice, adrenals and implants. The warehouses are heavily guarded, and some are rumored to hide the special projects of individual Hutts from their rivals.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234265" version="1065353216">As the technological heart of the galaxy, Nar Shaddaa is home to Network Access, a vital HoloNet hub that governs all HoloNet operations on Nar Shaddaa and much of Hutt Space. Billions of transactions and communications are processed each second by Network Access computer systems, ensuring the proper functioning of communications throughout the sector.

Boasting the galaxy's most state-of-the-art security protocols, Network Access is the ultimate challenge for enterprising slicers. The wealthy and powerful pay good money for information pirates to break into Network Access and recover data, redirect communications or simply &quot;tweak&quot; the truth. As one of the most heavily guarded places on Nar Shaddaa, anyone who manages to infiltrate Network Access's inner workings earns the status of legend.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234266" version="1065353216">Nar Shaddaa has ever been an attractive world for Nikto enforcers seeking employment with the Hutt Cartel. The Nikto Sector, as it is now known, began as a place where Nikto warriors came to attract the attention of prospective employers, but the sector was formally bequeathed to the Nikto Horoth Gendi by his Hutt master when he saved the Hutt's life and business in an act of quick-thinking bloodshed. 

Horoth Gendi used the opportunity to found his own gang and free himself from servitude to higher powers. Since that time, the Nikto Sector has fallen under the control of a succession of Nikto gangs seeking a bigger piece of Nar Shaddaa's underworld business--the latest of these gangs being the formidable Kintan Kings.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="234267" version="1065353216">Red Light Sector</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234267" version="1065353216">For this year's proven, high-quality implants and neuro-stim technology, visitors to Nar Shaddaa go to the Promenade. For next year's innovations, they go to the Red Light Sector. The bodily enhancements available in the Red Light Sector are almost uniformly illegal, untested, highly dangerous or all three. 

Athletes looking for an undetectable edge, opportunistic gang members and adrenaline junkies alike all come in search of the new and death-defying. Some of the technologies sold in the Red Light shops eventually make it to market in legitimate form, while others become staples of the high-risk, high-reward underground implant scene.

Alongside the surgical and bioenhancement shops, other shady businesses preying on sentient appetites tend to bloom. In particular, slavers and spice dealers often offer products here, taking advantage of Red Light Sector customers' wealth, desperation or moral flexibility, as appropriate.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="234268" version="1065353216">Upper Industrial Sector</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234268" version="1065353216">The Upper Industrial Sector is the center of manufacturing and industry for Republic corporations on Nar Shaddaa. Here, centuries-old droid construction facilities stand next to the cluttered offices of startup firms desperate for resources and space. The companies share a common need for heavy security and compete for similar clientele, ensuring that this sector remains a choice location--but are otherwise wholly independent.

For a corporation headquartered in Republic space, Nar Shaddaa is a convenient place to develop technologies restricted by Republic laws--or from which to deal with foreign parties. The Senate frowns on these activities, but just as often turns a blind eye when these same corporations bring their innovations back to Republic worlds.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="234269" version="1065353216">Shadow Town</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234269" version="1065353216">At first glance, Shadow Town resembles an ordinary Nar Shaddaa slum. Its population makes it unique. Rather than housing underworld gangs or powerful Hutts, Shadow Town is home to imprisoned individuals who were once useful to the Empire and who may be useful still--scientists, assassins and genetic experiments too valuable to kill and too dangerous to release.

Cranial implants designed to explode upon leaving Shadow Town's borders are implanted in prisoners' heads. Secondary prisons manned by Imperial personnel store prisoners who must be kept docile. Many residents of Shadow Town make the best of their early, forced retirement, cooperating with Imperial authorities and living relatively &quot;ordinary&quot; lives... but nearly all would flee, given an opportunity.

The Empire pays the Hutt Cartel a considerable sum to keep Shadow Town running. For the Hutts, the risk of keeping prisoners even the Empire doesn't want inside its borders is offset by the considerable rewards.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234270" version="1065353216">The Star Cluster Casino certainly wasn't the first casino to be built on Nar Shaddaa, but every casino since has tried to match its sleek design, pulsing lights and various entertainment options. The Star Cluster was the first to debut live dancers, the first to feature sabacc and the first to hire scantily clad girls as waitresses. 

Owned by a conglomerate of Nar Shaddaa industrialists (including Czerka Corporation executive Yem Leksende), the Star Cluster Casino is an attraction for tourists and weary working stiffs alike. Some have derided it as just another way in which the rich steal from the poor on Nar Shaddaa, but that hasn't stopped business from booming.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="234271" version="1065353216">The Promenade</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234271" version="1065353216">The Promenade is Nar Shaddaa at its most lavish and inviting. Divided into upper and lower levels, the area is covered by the Hutts' strict no-fighting policy and offers a rare respite from the conflict that wracks the rest of the galaxy. Rivals and sworn enemies are expected to put aside their differences here--or else be brutally handled by Hutt Cartel enforcers.

Clubs, entertainment venues and high-end shopping line the arrival points from Nar Shaddaa's spaceports, and casual visitors can find everything they need at Promenade vendors. Speeders are available to many of Nar Shaddaa's districts, but by far the most popular routes lead to the Club Vertica and Star Cluster casinos.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="234272" version="1065353216">Slave Trading on Nar Shaddaa</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234272" version="1065353216">The slave trade is one of the most profitable and pervasive industries on Nar Shaddaa. Although slavery is officially condemned by the Republic, rapid Imperial expansion has caused a boom in the number of potential buyers. Recognizing the demand, the Hutt Cartel, the Nar Shaddaa Labor Alliance and others established Nar Shaddaa as the galaxy's premier location for slavers to display and sell product.

In addition to the expected slave markets and auction houses, entrepreneurs have built up an entire business infrastructure to facilitate the practice of buying and selling living beings as property. Intrepid businessmen offer inspection and appraisal of goods, security and transport services, and even long-term carbonite storage facilities.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="234274" version="1065353216">The Spice Business</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234274" version="1065353216">The term &quot;spice&quot; refers to a wide variety of substances trafficked throughout the galaxy. Some types of spice are primarily medicinal, refined into lifesaving painkillers or used to treat mental illness; more often than not, however, spice traders deal in addictive, recreational chemical compounds with unpredictable and dangerous physical and psychological effects.

Spice is tightly regulated--or completely banned--on most Republic and Imperial worlds. On the Hutt-controlled moon of Nar Shaddaa, however, spice is openly imported, processed, refined and packaged for both local and offworld distribution. Nar Shaddaa's spice trade is split among numerous gangs and petty crime lords who use the profits to fund other, often violent, activities.

In recent years, the Exchange crime syndicate has offered several key players cut-rate distribution of product on Republic worlds through their existing criminal networks. The newly forged alliances have finally given the Exchange a foothold in the spice trade, much to the chagrin of the Hutts.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="234275" version="1065353216">Data Slicing</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234275" version="1065353216">Data slicing is one of the less advertised, though very profitable, industries thriving on Nar Shaddaa. For the right price, computer and electronics experts can be hired for a variety of services. Traditionally, these include corporate espionage, personal information-gathering (whether as part of an investigation or for use in blackmail) and security enhancements. However, with the escalating tension between Republic and Imperial forces, skilled slicers are now often employed as code breakers and saboteurs.

Some of the best slicers in the galaxy are self-taught independent operators. Advantages of employing outside experts in covert military operations include plausible deniability and the option to forego rescue operations when a mission asset is compromised or captured. Whether this offsets the risk of a slicer switching sides for a better offer is a matter of debate.</text>

Understandably rare, these advanced and complex items are constructed using unique materials and radical engineering otherwise unknown to Republic and Imperial scientists. 

Whether these items are relics of ancient civilizations that disappeared long ago or artifacts from thriving cultures waiting to be discovered is almost always unclear, as are the explanations for how the technology found its way to known space.</text>

Operational Summary: Chatter indicated that Nar Shaddaa was the source of weapons, supplies, stimulants used by the Eagle's terrorist network. Retired asset Watcher X was chosen to assist primary (Cipher Nine) due to extensive local knowledge.

The terror cell was identified as operating out of VerveGen, a local medical corporation. Leadership was eliminated and data retrieved.

Ethical and legal restrictions against experimenting on living soldiers required the Republic military to conduct the research as a black ops project on Nar Shaddaa; on the virtually lawless Hutt moon, those in charge could easily acquire technology and resources that were banned in the Republic without raising suspicion in the Senate. However, being located on a non-Republic-controlled world left the project vulnerable to enemy attack or infiltration in the event of discovery.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="234286" version="1065353216">One of the galaxy's most prominent crime syndicates, the Exchange is the sleek, tech-savvy competitor to the Hutt Cartel. Where the Hutt Cartel has a clear, centralized authority in Hutt Space, the Exchange is a distributed network of gangs coordinated via the HoloNet; where the Hutt Cartel favors galactic neutrality, the Exchange sees the Empire as an untapped resource ready to bleed credits and the Republic as a living shield protecting its gangsters from Imperial retaliation.

Three centuries ago, the Exchange was arguably the most influential criminal organization in the Republic. However, an internal power struggle to claim the territory of the infamous Davik Kang after his death left the Exchange in disarray, allowing the Hutt Cartel to seize control over many of its operations. It took many decades before the &quot;new breed&quot; of Exchange criminals arose, and the current syndicate is a different animal than the old.

Active in slicing, extortion, spice dealing and weapons running, the Exchange is rapidly reclaiming lost territory, taking advantage of riots, gang wars and other acts of blatant violence to gain ground even on Hutt worlds like Nar Shaddaa. But the Empire is swiftly becoming a greater adversary than the Hutts--the Exchange wants to be the first crime syndicate to make solid inroads into Imperial space and is willing to kill whoever it takes to get there.</text>

He solidified his title as the galaxy's greatest gladiator when he defeated notorious Wookiee-hunter Karssk on Ord Mantell. The more gullible underworld scum whisper that Bowdaar is an immortal creature who can't be killed, but those who have faced him and lived know that he is simply the best there is. 

On the surface, Bowdaar may seem like a simple-minded brute, but nothing could be further from the truth. Case in point: Bowdaar eventually discovered the identity of the Trandoshans who first captured and enslaved him. One night in an arena on Loovria, Bowdaar learned that his former captors were sitting in the stands. An unfortunate &quot;weapons malfunction&quot; caused the drunken Trandoshan slavers to meet an untimely--and extremely messy--end.

Where the Hutt obtained his immense wealth remains a mystery, but everyone agrees that he knows how to spend it. Drooga's luxurious pleasure barge is one of the few places on Nar Shaddaa where the only barrier to entry is a person's entertainment value. So long as Drooga finds a guest amusing, the party never ends.

Sadly, Drooga is fickle even for a Hutt. He quickly tires of even the most provocative and outrageous individuals in his entourage. It is fair to say that Drooga has no friends, only temporary acquaintances. Guests who overstay their welcomes tend to suffer unfortunate accidents requiring long-term stays in a kolto tank.</text>

Halidrell Setsyn came into Baras's service unexpectedly after taking over from his previous operative--she tricked the slaver out of a large number of credits and some of his stock, not knowing who he worked for.

He was the only acolyte of his group to survive the Sith trials on Korriban. Some say this was more than just luck. A string of unexplained murders at the Sith Academy abruptly ended when Sadic finally left Korriban.

Initially apprenticed to Lord Umbriss, Sadic served as his master's personal assassin for several years. That apprenticeship ended the same day Umbriss crossed Darth Angral, who &quot;inherited&quot; Sadic along with Umbriss's estate and wealth. Although Sadic pledged eternal loyalty to his new master, Darth Angral kept his apprentice on a tight leash.

Alias: Watcher X
Gender: Male
Species: Human (enhanced)
Age: 42

Background (Summary): Watcher X was genetically altered while in the womb as part of a joint Imperial Intelligence-Science Bureau initiative. His family was chosen by the project, and he was subjected to a series of additional procedures during maturation. By adolescence, he showed a keen mind and strong physical aptitude.

Watcher X joined Imperial Intelligence at the age of twenty-one and worked at several high-profile positions within the organization before Operation: Undertow caused his service to be re-evaluated. Despite his past successes, Undertow's bloody end marked Watcher X as a danger to fellow personnel. He was redesignated and assigned to Shadow Town.

Personality: Watcher X suffers from an inability to control his own intellect, compulsively analyzing situations and studying even the most unlikely outcomes. This manifests in acute paranoia and sociopathic tendencies. Watcher X feels betrayed by the Empire, and agents dealing with him should not rely on Watcher X's sense of duty.</text>

Living for thousands of years, they possess distributed nervous and vascular systems and lack any vulnerable vital organs. Combined with their natural regenerative abilities, they can survive almost any injury, including total dismemberment. Despite their resilience, Gen'Dai typically wear heavy armor to give structure to their sinewy, boneless forms.

Abandoning their homeworld millennia ago for unknown reasons, most Gen'Dai now lead a nomadic existence. Believing in the perfection of permanence, these nonviolent philosophers see change as an illusion; as a result, Gen'Dai rarely take an active role in anything, preferring to remain unobtrusive observers as galactic history unfolds. 

Some Gen'Dai suffer mental deterioration as they age. This leads to a pronounced increase in violent tendencies, and some of the afflicted eventually become mercenaries or bounty hunters. Most documented Gen'Dai encounters involve these rogue individuals, giving the species a somewhat unfavorable and undeserved reputation for viciousness.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="258893" version="1065353216">Thousands of years ago, before the noble houses had united to form the Alderaanian parliament, the warring families gathered for a decisive battle at the ravine now known as King's Pass. Before the fighting could commence, Darrus Alde, the head of House Alde, parleyed with the other noble families and convinced them to abandon their centuries-old rivalries. His decisive leadership ended generations of strife and led to the construction of the Elysium, where Darrus was elected and anointed as the first king of Alderaan.

In recent years, the native Killiks have repopulated the area, provoking increasingly violent skirmishes with the neighboring Alderaanians. The ravine's strategic location has also made it a hotbed of violence between the major noble houses as they struggle for control.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="258978" version="1065353216">Duke Corwin &quot;The Durasteel Duke&quot; (Bounty Hunter)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="258978" version="1065353216">The nobleman dubbed &quot;The Durasteel Duke&quot; is both a celebrity and local legend, a charismatic and fearless leader and politician who has never once backed down in the face of threats or intimidation or refused to meet a rival face-to-face. Many a schemer has attempted to take advantage of the duke's brash and audacious nature to lure him into a trap, only to find himself staring dumbfounded and slack-jawed at the duke's unperturbed and unmolested person upon their next meeting.

It is said that the duke's invincibility is so assured that he has never had to raise a hand against another living being--a claim supported by his famous refusal of a pistol during an honor duel. By all accounts, the duke's aggrieved opponent chose to turn the weapon upon himself rather than face the duke's unrelenting gaze.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259099" version="1065353216">History of Alderaan</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259099" version="1065353216">Originally inhabited by the insectoid Killiks, Alderaan's pre-colonial history is lost, save for in the hive mind of the aliens. By the time the first human colonists came to Alderaan from Coruscant--about 2,500 years before the founding of the Galactic Republic--the Killiks had migrated into deep space, leaving only a scattered few nests hibernating underground and the empty shells of their hives.

Alderaan's pristine beauty attracted thousands of settlers, and the human colonies quickly developed into thriving provinces. The Alderaanian monarchy made preservation of the environment a top priority in the planet's development, a policy that holds true today.

Later, the planet would become one of the Core Founders of the Republic and among the most powerful voices in the Senate. The princes and princesses of the ruling family typically served as Alderaan's representatives, though other members of the Alderaanian nobility have held the position as well.

Alderaan's recent departure from the Republic and the resulting civil war are among the darkest moments in a bright and optimistic history. Whether the planet will ever regain its former glory is an open question.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259376" version="1065353216">The Elysium</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259376" version="1065353216">For millennia, the Elysium has served as the symbolic center of Alderaanian politics. Years before the capital city was founded, the various noble houses met in the Elysium to elect and anoint their first king. Until recently, every dispute over succession in Alderaan's history had been peacefully resolved within its stone walls, and the houses' greatest treasures were placed in Elysium vaults as a symbol of trust.

When Gaul Panteer was assassinated and Alderaan's ailing queen passed on in a mysterious transport crash, the parliament assembled in the Elysium to elect a new sovereign. It was then that House Thul made its move, returning to Alderaan after decades of exile. Violence and accusations erupted almost immediately, and since then, the Elysium has remained an empty, forgotten symbol of Alderaanian unity--its ancient halls cracking as distant bombs fall, and its beauty quickly fading.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259380" version="1065353216">The Glarus Valley</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259380" version="1065353216">Glarus Valley has long been the ancestral home of House Panteer, the royal family of Alderaan, and the site of the Elysium and Castle Panteer itself. The valley was once the seat of culture and democracy on Alderaan, a place where squabbling nobles could resolve their disputes peacefully.

Like so much of Alderaan, the land is now ravaged by war. Castle Panteer has fallen to House Ulgo, and the Elysium is all but abandoned. Although House Thul and House Organa maintain a small presence in the area, the disciplined soldiers of House Ulgo tighten their hold every day. There are rumors that the royal family is still in hiding somewhere in the valley, but even Ulgo has been unable to find them.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259384" version="1065353216">The Juran Mountains</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259384" version="1065353216">The majestic Juran Mountains have been the site of many conflicts in recent years. During the Battle of Alderaan, Republic resistance fighters sought refuge in the mountains, using the natural cover to hide from the invading Imperial forces. It was here that Captain Jace Malcom led Havoc Squad in an ambush against Darth Malgus; with the help of Satele Shan, the Republic troopers were able to triumph over the powerful Sith Lord.

After a few short years of peace, violence has once again erupted in the area. House Ulgo, backed by its vassals in House Rist, has occupied the region and is locked in a brutal conflict with the forces of House Thul and House Organa.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259390" version="1065353216">Kaamos Territory</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259390" version="1065353216">The Kaamos Territory is the ancestral homeland of House Thul, one of the major houses of Alderaan and a contender for the throne. After Thul returned from exile with its Imperial allies, the nobles set about rebuilding on the grounds of the ancient Thul palace--abandoned long ago but not entirely destroyed, ready to be returned to glory. Thul's grip on the territory is still tenuous, as the house faces incursions from both the native Killiks and enemy houses.

The Lerantha Dam is also located in the Kaamos Territory--a long-standing landmark and generator plant built at the edge of the Lerantha Lake. Currently, House Ulgo controls the dam, threatening the edges of House Thul's territory.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259712" version="1065353216">Battle of Alderaan</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259712" version="1065353216">Countless star systems fell to the Empire during the Great War, yet many in the Republic believed the Core Worlds were safe from attack. That all changed when the Empire invaded Alderaan; the Sith Lord Darth Malgus led the attack, timing his invasion with a feint that drew the Republic's fleet light years away. 

Unknown to Malgus, a small contingent of Republic soldiers was stationed on Alderaan. The soldiers were outnumbered and disorganized, but among them were the members of Havoc Squad, the Republic's most decorated military unit. Under the leadership of Captain Jace Malcom, the Havoc Squad commandos rallied the Republic troops and waged a fierce guerrilla campaign against the Empire.

The resistance fighters harried the Imperial forces constantly, delaying their advance long enough for the Republic fleet to race back and repel the invasion. In the end, Darth Malgus was defeated and the Empire was driven from Alderaan. The victory was a costly one, though; Alderaan would not soon forget the devastation.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259728" version="1065353216">Joiners and the Killik Hive Mind</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259728" version="1065353216">Joiners are non-Killik individuals who have been absorbed into the Killik hive mind. Prolonged exposure to the powerful pheromones released by Killiks causes an alteration of the subjects' brain chemistry, making them subservient to the nest's desires. Long-term exposure can turn a subject's eyes completely black, though this appears to be the extent of visible physiological changes.

Initially, Joiners retain many characteristics of their own personality, as well as some sense of individual identity. At this point Joiners often describe the relationship as symbiotic, feeling they gain more from the Joining than the Killiks. Over time, however, their personalities become more and more subsumed, until they cannot conceive of any existence away from the hive mind.

In turn, a nest also absorbs the knowledge, skills and personality traits of its Joiners. A single Joiner rarely changes a nest's nature, but a nest that Joins an army of warriors may become war-like, and a nest that Joins a party of explorers may gain a degree of curiosity and wanderlust.

It is possible to medically reverse the Joining process even in the later stages. However, most Joiners--even those experiencing the initial transformation--refuse to willingly submit to the procedure.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259731" version="1065353216">Noble Houses</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259731" version="1065353216">The nobility of Alderaan is responsible for ruling the planet and choosing the reigning monarch in often vicious, always intricate games of local politics. Each noble house bears the family name of its original founders, and many nobles can trace their lineage back over hundreds of generations. However, noble blood is not a requirement for house membership; in less traditional houses, it is not unheard of for an ambitious servant or farmer to rise above his or her station.

Three main houses currently compete for Alderaan's throne: House Organa, House Thul and House Ulgo. Although these three are the most powerful houses on Alderaan, might is not the only path to survival. In many cases, a larger noble house will take a smaller, like-minded one under its protection. Referred to as a &quot;vassal,&quot; these smaller houses typically provide support and fealty to the larger. A strategic alliance can mean the difference between ultimate ambition or permanent extinction.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259733" version="1065353216">The War for Alderaan's Throne</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259733" version="1065353216">Despite its arguable necessity, the Treaty of Coruscant was extremely controversial. Senator Gaul Panteer, heir to the Alderaanian throne, opposed the treaty and arranged Alderaan's withdrawal from the Republic in protest. Gaul was said to be secretly negotiating the terms of Alderaan's return, but he was assassinated before he could do so; his ailing mother, the queen, died days later in a mysterious crash, leaving Alderaan without a ruler and without Republic protection.

The ensuing power vacuum allowed House Thul--now supported by the Empire--to return from exile. With the nobility in chaos and a possible Imperial takeover on the horizon, Bouris Ulgo, a former Republic general, declared himself king. House Panteer challenged Ulgo's rule, but its estates were quickly overrun and destroyed. House Organa, still loyal to the Republic, opposed House Ulgo diplomatically until it could marshal its forces. It wasn't long before all-out war broke out between House Ulgo, House Organa and House Thul, with all three families and countless lesser houses vying for the Alderaanian crown.</text>

Location: Alderaan
Date: Classified
Primary: Cipher Nine
Secondary: Vector Hyllus

Operational Summary: Funding for the Eagle's terrorist network was traced to Alderaan; Cipher Nine was sent to identify and eliminate source. Imperial Diplomatic Service member Vector Hyllus was chosen to assist despite uncertain status (see cross-reference).

Cipher Nine and Vector Hyllus identified local negotiator Denri Ayl and Baroness Chay Cortess as primary funders of the terrorist network. House Cortess was not implicated as a whole; however, appropriate responses and precautions have been taken. Vector Hyllus was flagged as an asset, and permanent transfer from the Diplomatic Service was granted.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259741" version="1065353216">Galactic diplomacy and the Jedi Order have been intertwined for thousands of years. Renowned for their sense of justice and wide cultural awareness, Jedi negotiators are in high demand. Sometimes a Jedi will represent the interests of the Republic or the Jedi Order, but Jedi often act as a neutral third party between two factions; an outsider who can be trusted to arbitrate disputes fairly.

The talents of the Jedi and their adherence to the Jedi Code make them well suited to diplomatic endeavors. Jedi are trained in galactic law and history, often understand obscure languages and customs, and are famed for their devotion to peace. In addition, anyone trying to bribe or lie to a Jedi diplomat will be met with polite amusement at best--and at worst, heavy sanctions and criminal charges from the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259742" version="1065353216">The Death Mark (Knight)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259742" version="1065353216">A top secret Republic prototype, the Death Mark is an orbital platform that fires an incredibly accurate beam of superconcentrated energy at a specific individual, resulting in instant death. The energy beam can penetrate virtually any structure or shield, making escape almost impossible.

The orbital platform tracks individuals who have been marked with a special targeting device. The targeting device is only effective at extreme close range, meaning an operative must get within several meters of an intended victim to use it. The targeting process is undetectable, and once marked, an individual can be tracked indefinitely, allowing the killing blow to be dealt hours or even days later.

In theory, the Death Mark could save hundreds of lives, as key enemy leaders could be eliminated without the need for armies or the risk of collateral damage. In the wrong hands, however, the Death Mark becomes a weapon of terror, raining murder down from the sky.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259746" version="1065353216">The apprentice of the legendary Darth Malak--the Sith Lord responsible for the destruction of Taris--Darth Bandon was a promising young Padawan before he joined the Sith Order. He was slain by the Jedi Knight Revan during the Jedi Civil War, but his remains were confiscated by a group of particularly fanatical Sith acolytes who (for reasons best left unexplored) used Sith alchemy to preserve Bandon's head.

After Revan cut down Darth Malak and ended the war, the leaderless and disillusioned Sith turned to Bandon's head for guidance, claiming they could use it to communicate with the deceased Sith Lord. The cult eventually caught the attention of the Jedi during a misguided attempt to find Bandon a fresh body; the Jedi dismantled the cult, but found no trace of the fabled head.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259824" version="1065353216">House Alde</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259824" version="1065353216">Alderaan's oldest surviving noble house by far, House Alde is obsessed with antiquity and lineage. Its nobles studiously avoid polluting their bloodline with foreign influences, preserving the blood of King Alde, the first ruler of Alderaan.

These practices have left the family isolated and eccentric, but its scholarly grasp of history and Alderaanian lore is equal to none. Its obsessions are widely considered unusual, but not dangerous--Alde pride and pomposity rarely devolves into genuine arrogance. For over a century, Alde has stayed closely allied with House Organa, appreciating Organa's devotion to Alderaan's historical ties with the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259829" version="1065353216">House Organa</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259829" version="1065353216">House Organa is perhaps the most respected noble house on Alderaan. Organa ancestors were among the first to settle the planet and were pivotal in the formation of the Galactic Republic. The Organas have remained vocal supporters of the Republic for millennia, believers in patient negotiation over aggression, and were outraged when Senator Gaul Panteer announced Alderaan's independence. 

The current Duke Organa epitomizes what the house is known for. During the war, the duke was a fierce opponent of the Empire and the Sith who saw his family treated brutally during the Empire's short-lived invasion of Alderaan. This neither soured the duke and his house on peace, nor weakened their resolve to battle evil; when Alderaan's civil war began years later, Organa was among the last houses to take up arms... but the duke had privately trained a talented and honorable battalion for such an eventuality, and readily turned to the Republic for advice and assistance during the crisis. Today, Organa remains the Republic's fiercest ally on the planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259835" version="1065353216">House Panteer</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259835" version="1065353216">Arguably the most blue-blooded of the noble houses, House Panteer has put more kings and queens on the Alderaanian throne than all other families combined. Panteer rulers have been called both patriots and pragmatists--traditionally, they have been believers in the beauty of Alderaan and patrons of the arts who nonetheless accept that a lie, a betrayal or even a dagger can be a sad political necessity. The last uncontested ruler of Alderaan was a proud Panteer queen who had earned the respect--if not always the love--of both friends and adversaries.

When Bouris Ulgo declared himself king, House Panteer immediately challenged his rule. Ulgo responded by burning the Panteer estates to the ground and forcing the survivors into hiding, bringing the family low after millennia. While many nobles still see the Panteers as rightful heirs to the Alderaanian throne, and many others seek Panteer's blessing to legitimize their own claims to the crown, the Panteers remain suspicious--wondering about the circumstances behind their downfall, and hoping to reclaim lost glory.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259837" version="1065353216">House Rist</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259837" version="1065353216">Legendary assassins and spies, the members of House Rist trace their roots to an Exchange crime lord who provided illicit services to the Alderaanian nobility. After years of underhanded dealings, the crime lord was granted his own lands, and the Rists were legitimized as a minor noble house. Rather than abandon their criminal roots, however, the Rists continued to discreetly ply their murderous trade while enjoying the trappings of privilege, earning favor and leverage with the other nobles in the process. 

Eventually House Ulgo sought and acquired House Rist's pledge as a vassal. The promotion was a controversial move, but a shrewd one, as the Ulgos now had sole claim to the Rists' vast underworld resources. The recent death of Gaul Panteer has cast suspicion on Rist and Ulgo alike, as many believe Rist assassins were responsible for the Senator's demise.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259838" version="1065353216">House Thul</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259838" version="1065353216">The members of House Thul are descended from a wealthy and ambitious merchant who bought his way into the nobility. The Thuls considered this a point of pride, specializing in brokering trade and acting as caretakers of Alderaan's economy--yet for generations, the relative youth of the Thul house carried a stigma.

Unable to marry a Thul into royalty, the house made a desperate bid for the throne--Thuls switched an Organa infant with a Thul baby and supported the changeling as a potential bride for the crown prince. A young Jedi exposed the treachery and stopped the wedding, creating a scandal that led to the disgraced Thul's exile from Alderaan.

Thul maintained its pride and its culture in exile, though the house became impoverished and isolated in its offworld estates. It was decades before Thul nobles were contacted by the Imperial Diplomatic Service; the Empire promised to restore Thul to its rightful glory, to train its soldiers and educate its children and one day help it return to Alderaan.

At last, in the aftermath of Alderaan's withdrawal from the Republic and the death of its queen, a generation of Thuls raised alongside the Empire came home--eager to restore the family name and take vengeance against Thul's enemies. Thul has already gained the allegiance of a number of lesser houses, and with Imperial support stands as a true contender for the throne.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259841" version="1065353216">House Ulgo</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259841" version="1065353216">The noble House Ulgo has a long history of military excellence. The family values discipline and duty above all else, and Ulgos pride themselves on forsaking the pampered, aristocratic lifestyles the other noble houses have gravitated toward. The Ulgo tradition of requiring every member to serve in the military has produced generations of distinguished officers. 

In recent years, the Ulgos became increasingly frustrated with the political stalemate in the Alderaanian parliament. When the queen died and House Thul returned from exile with the support of the Empire, General Bouris Ulgo pleaded with the collected nobles to act quickly to push Thul back off the planet. When it became clear the nobles were too fractured to stop what he saw as a second Imperial invasion, Bouris Ulgo declared himself king and declared war on House Thul. Unfortunately, grabbing the crown forced the hand of the other noble houses and they declared war against Ulgo. House Ulgo now finds itself beset on all sides as it struggles to defend the crown and brutally reinstate order on Alderaan--no matter the cost in blood and resources.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259852" version="1065353216">Girard is a relatively minor noble house that remained independent in the grand scheme of Alderaanian politics until the recent civil war left it dangerously exposed. Since then, House Girard has pledged its resources and influence to House Thul (and Thul's Imperial backers) in exchange for protection.

The whole of House Girard's nobility now resides in a wing of the Thul estate. There, the Girard nobles await their inevitable victory and the reclamation of their imperiled lands--along with the receipt of new territories as reward for their loyal support.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259855" version="1065353216">Closely related to the royal House Panteer, House Teral enjoyed several generations of growth and prosperity through trade and its connections to the royal family. Unsurprisingly, House Teral's troubles began after House Ulgo usurped the throne and effectively obliterated House Panteer. Seeing that House Teral's trade fortune could allow its Panteer cousins to rebuild, House Ulgo began a campaign against Teral's holdings and property. King Bouris Ulgo used his influence to shatter House Teral's trading contacts and forced Teral--never a military house--to raise massive armies to face Ulgo attacks.

Today, harried and nearly bankrupt, House Teral is a shadow of its formerly prosperous self. The last straw was the recent death of its diplomatic delegate. Although officially judged an accident, no one is fooled; it is clear that House Ulgo will be satisfied with nothing less than Teral's utter destruction.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259860" version="1065353216">A relatively minor noble family, House Baliss has amassed much of its influence currying favor with the larger houses. Many aristocrats joke that Baliss has served as vassal to every noble family of any significance. Baliss remained neutral when war broke out between the major houses, preferring to wait for a decisive victor to emerge before declaring any allegiances. 

Recently, the Baliss estate was overrun with Killiks, forcing the nobles to abandon their home. Baliss sought refuge with another minor family, House Teraan; the head of House Baliss, Duke Yun, decided to capitalize on the chaos engulfing Alderaan and make the Teraan estate the new Baliss home.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259872" version="1065353216">Bouris Ulgo</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259872" version="1065353216">Stiff and arrogant, Bouris Ulgo is nevertheless a patriot who believes himself the last sane noble on Alderaan. The former head of the planet's fighting forces and a decorated Republic general, Ulgo anticipated a swift return to his farming estates after the Great War. To his surprise and dismay, he was not released from duty, and the military was asked to remain on high alert as Alderaan's nobles played at politics.

Alderaan's withdrawal from the Republic, the deaths of the queen and her heir, and the return of House Thul forced Ulgo to take matters into his own hands; while the nobles bickered over their next ruler, Ulgo deployed his troops, declared himself king and instituted martial law. Sources close to the king say he was genuinely surprised to face opposition, but he swiftly razed House Panteer's estates and declared war on any house that dared defy him. Many now question Ulgo's mental state, whispering that the once great man has become brutal and paranoid.

Some heads are not fit to wear the crown.</text>

As a young man and Padawan, he returned to Alderaan for the first time and soon fell in love with a daughter of House Rist. 

At the time, House Rist was weighing an alliance with House Organa and both houses saw the match as an opportunity to seal their relationship. But the Jedi Order refused to consent to such a politically burdensome marriage; Nomar broke off the engagement and has served the Jedi Order dutifully ever since.</text>

A dangerous woman in her own right, Lady Rist is known for her tough, cold demeanor and for the many suitors she has rejected over the years. While her brother would prefer that she marry and raise House Rist's profile on Alderaan, Rehanna is stubborn in her refusal, and her brother does not dare force her.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259885" version="1065353216">Name: Vector Hyllus
Gender: Male
Species: Human (enhanced)
Age: 26
Likes: Diplomacy, helping people, exploring alien cultures
Dislikes: Greed, cruelty, prejudice, anti-alien sentiment

Primary Weapon: Techstaff

Background (Summary): Second-generation Imperial; mother native to Jurio, married Captain Adronik Hyllus after Jurio was granted Imperial governance. Expressed desire to join Diplomatic Service at an early age and displayed appropriate traits. Ranked high academically during training, and soon after graduation was granted (by request) post aboard exploration and first contact vessel (see service record).

Reassigned to Alderaan due to diplomatic manpower needs (see House Thul). Served ably until encounter with Killik species and subsequent &quot;Joiner&quot; transformation. Current status is unclear.

Personality: Vector Hyllus has repeatedly expressed admiration for Imperial accomplishments while indicating a desire to spread Imperial influence through diplomatic channels. His attitudes were likely shaped by the Imperial reconstruction of his homeworld and are appropriate for a Diplomatic Service member. Hyllus is obedient, intelligent, charismatic and effective. He is unlikely to advance further within diplomatic or military hierarchies.

Notes: Personality profile compiled from performance reports from before Hyllus's &quot;Joiner&quot; transformation. Data should be considered non-comprehensive.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259888" version="1065353216">A wily and self-serving noble of House Thul, Duke Kendoh has never seen a situation that he could not transform into an opportunity. Born and raised during Thul's exile in Imperial space, Kendoh is by no means an unquestioning Imperial supporter; as much as he enjoys the luxuries Imperial credits buy, and despite being well aware of the debt his house owes the Empire, he also understands that the life of an Alderaanian noble can depend on his ability to out-think and outmaneuver his rivals... and that an ally can also be a political liability. 

At the same time, Duke Kendoh makes no claims to valor and knows how to be discreet. For this reason, the rest of House Thul indulges and supports him.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259895" version="1065353216">Small, ugly and brilliant, Lord Nefarid is the most cunning of Darth Angral's apprentices. The Force was never particularly strong in him, and few thought he would survive his training--much less rise to become Angral's favored servant.

Unable to match his peers' raw power, Nefarid has endured by keeping to the shadows and using pawns and spies to carry out his wicked schemes. He delights in sowing terror and paranoia among the frightened masses, but his true passion lies in besting those who believe themselves more powerful than him. The universe has treated Nefarid like garbage, and that has only made him more determined to prove his superiority.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259897" version="1065353216">Unlike the nobles he has been charged with protecting, Captain Balic Cormac is a commoner, a working-class soldier serving the noble house of Organa. He originally had hopes of enlisting in the Republic military, but those dreams were shattered when Gaul Panteer withdrew Alderaan from the Republic.

Cormac bears some resentment toward the nobility for its treatment of and seeming disregard for lower-class people like himself, but he is still completely loyal to House Organa and ready to lay his life down in defense of its banner.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259898" version="1065353216">Markus Thul is a loyal and high-ranking member of his house. Like the rest of his family, Markus was eager to return to Alderaan and see House Thul take its rightful place in the aristocracy, and he welcomed the Empire's support, confident Imperial strength would put House Thul on the throne.

However, years of watching his kinsmen cater to the Imperials' whims has made Markus question this so-called &quot;alliance.&quot; He now fears that House Thul has lost its way and willingly sold itself into servitude to the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="259911" version="1065353216">Killik</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="259911" version="1065353216">The original inhabitants of Alderaan, the insectoid Killiks spread across the planet and throughout neighboring star systems millennia before the foundation of the Republic. By the time human colonists found Alderaan, however, the Killiks had long since migrated into deep space for reasons unknown; the only evidence of their existence was their empty hive mounds.

In fact, a few Killiks had remained behind on Alderaan and lived in hibernation deep underground. Every few hundred years, these Killiks would emerge and come into conflict with the colonists before retreating and sleeping once again. The Alderaanians viewed the Killiks as monsters out of legend, and no one's certain how the Killiks view the Alderaanians.

Killik society is comprised of a collection of hive minds--some violently territorial, others gentle and reclusive. Individual Killiks possess no sense of identity or self, and each would unquestioningly sacrifice its life for the benefit of its nest. As a result, Killiks cannot comprehend the value other species place on individuals, making them difficult to interact or negotiate with. They do, however, have values of their own, creating beautiful works of art and engaging in complex ritual behavior.

The strength of the Killik hive mind is such that it can even absorb individuals from other species, altering their brain chemistry so that they respond to the will of the nest. These transformed individuals are commonly called Joiners.</text>

After the usurper Ulgo took the throne of Alderaan, Gesselle was responsible for Ulgo's first real military embarrassment--a feint in which two hundred of her soldiers died, while three thousand Ulgos were defeated.

Gesselle's hard-heartedness is rumored to extend into her personal life. She was nearly married to an undistinguished earl of House Alde on her eighteenth birthday, but the wedding was postponed, then cancelled for reasons never publicly discussed.</text>

Debate had been raging in the Republic over the issue of droid rights: Did droids deserve the same treatment as organic beings, and was owning droids tantamount to slavery? This question was rendered moot when a Czerka-built assassin droid, HK-01, went rogue and began reprogramming other droids to rise up against their masters, in what would be called the Great Droid Revolution.

Republic citizens, surrounded by thousands of rogue droids--every model, from protocol to sanitation to battle units--found themselves at the mercy of their former servants. Several planets were subjugated in the name of the droid rebellion, until the signal controlling the droids was traced. 

Following the signal, a team of Jedi destroyed HK-01, returning the rogue droids to their original programming. The relieved Republic returned to normal, and the issue of droid rights was not raised again.</text>

But when they were ambushed by thugs and Andur was killed, Nomi saw his spirit urging her to pick up his lightsaber and defend their daughter. Reluctantly taking up the weapon, Nomi skillfully fought the thugs off and later left for the planet Ambria to train under Master Thon.

While on Ambria, Nomi discovered she had a talent for battle meditation--the Jedi gift of influencing and inspiring others through the Force--but never lost her trepidation at wielding a lightsaber. Nevertheless, Nomi's Masters foresaw that she would have an important role to play in the galaxy, which came to fruition with the rise of the Krath cult.</text>

As the Jedi know only too well, evil can arise from the most unlikely of sources. In the years after the Great Droid Revolution, two aristocrats, Satal Keto and his cousin Aleema, came to power in the Empress Teta system. Bored and spoiled, they became interested in the secrets of the Sith. They and their friends formed a Sith cult named Krath.

But Satal and Aleema began to crave real power. During a visit to the Galactic Museum on Coruscant, they spotted a book of ancient Sith lore and rituals and decided to steal it. 

Once they had the book, they realized it was written in a long-forgotten Sith language. But Satal learned of the planet Onderon, once ruled by the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd, and the cousins left to unlock the book's secrets there.</text>

Once ruled by the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd, Onderon had gained a dark reputation. Master Arca Jeth sent three Jedi, including the brothers Ulic and Cay Qel-Droma, to act as stewards of the planet and bring peace to its people. When the Jedi arrived, Onderon's ruler--Queen Amanoa--begged for the Jedi's help in protecting her people from the warrior Beast Riders, who soon captured her daughter Galia.

Upon investigating, the Jedi learned the truth: Galia and the Beast Rider warlord Oron Kira had arranged the abduction together, planning to marry and unite their warring cultures. Queen Amanoa was actually a descendant of Freedon Nadd, strong in the dark side, and the Jedi were among her enemies.

The queen's forces battled with those of the Beast Riders and the Jedi. Cay Qel-Droma lost his arm in the fighting, and only the arrival of Arca Jeth--who used battle meditation to turn the battle in the Jedi's favor--saved Onderon. With Queen Amanoa's defeat, Galia and Oron Kira began rebuilding their world.</text>

With Queen Amanoa dead, Onderon enjoyed a brief period of peace, but a shadow still hung over the planet. So-called &quot;Naddist Rebels&quot; began to emerge, a sect that revered the teachings of the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd. Master Arca Jeth and his students sought to cleanse Onderon of Nadd's influence by moving Nadd's sarcophagus to Onderon's moon, Dxun, but they were ambushed by Naddists who stole the sarcophagus. 

While seeking out the Naddists, Arca Jeth discovered that King Ommin, long thought dead, was being kept alive in a secret facility. Also a follower of Nadd, Ommin joined forces with Nadd's undying spirit and managed to capture Arca Jeth. The king fled to a secret stronghold while Arca Jeth's student, Ulic Qel-Droma, called for Republic reinforcements.</text>

The ancestral home of House Organa, it has been a reliable source of wealth for generations, as the noble family has made the coast into productive farmland.

Unfortunately, this fruitful land has now been marred by invaders from House Thul. After a failed assault on House Organa itself, Thul forces have dug up Organa's fertile farms and turned the area into a massive army camp. Thul forces are there to stay, a constant challenger in the face of their rivals.</text>

Swift, formidable in combat and possessed of an impressive crew and cargo capacity, the Thranta's flexibility has ensured its continuing use. The corvette does have its drawbacks, however, lacking the firepower to go toe-to-toe with Imperial dreadnoughts or penetrate planetary defenses.

The Thranta was designed and is manufactured by Corellia StarDrive, but its inspiration can be found in Republic warship designs going back centuries. Discussions of a revamped successor model frequently arise, but no prototype has been publicly revealed.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="283578" version="1065353216">Resembling the larger, more heavily armed Terminus-class destroyer, the Gage-class transport trades the destroyer's numerous turbolaser banks for cargo space and troop barracks. Where the Gage does resemble its cousin, however, is its heavy armor--the Gage isn't built for speed or combat, but to get its cargo to a destination intact.

Captaincy of a Gage is often a first step for Imperial naval officers seeking greater responsibilities, but it can also be a punishment for an officer who's drawn the ire of his superiors. In one famous case during the last war, a disgraced captain took advantage of the Gage's armor in an act of redemption--ramming the ship into a Republic battle station, tearing through deck after deck before the Gage was destroyed.</text>

Its wedge-shaped design is typical of Imperial warships going back to the founding of Dromund Kaas, but its technology is strictly state-of-the-art. The Harrower is capable of holding its own against starfighter fleets or multiple smaller warships but is best used as the backbone of an Imperial fleet--coordinating attacks, absorbing damage and launching devastating volleys where needed.

The energy and material cost of building a single Harrower is roughly equivalent to ten years' output of a major planetary mining colony. The loss of a Harrower is enough to pain logistics operators across the Empire.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="283582" version="1065353216">Not strictly a formal ship class, but more a catch-all for a variety of similar vessels, the Wanderer-class applies to military vessels (usually corvettes) converted for partial civilian use. Rather than scrap an outdated warship, the Republic prefers to strip it of most armaments and use it for cargo and passenger runs--both official and civilian. For an ordinary citizen not in the business of interstellar trade, renting space or booking passage aboard a Wanderer is often cheaper and safer than hiring an independent transport vessel.

Despite the fact that a Wanderer's load can be up to seventy percent civilian, such ships are always crewed by military personnel. Wanderers are still military property, and piracy is a danger even along secure hyperspace routes.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="283585" version="1065353216">The decades-long war between the Galactic Republic and the rejuvenated Sith Empire ended without a decisive battle. Instead, the conflict halted with a peace agreement neither side believed would last--the Treaty of Coruscant, a document forbidding Republic military activity within Imperial space and vice versa. Rules of engagement in neutral territory are far more vague, allowing for a range of border conflicts and attacks via third parties, but the treaty has prevented all-out warfare on more than one occasion.

Negotiations began when the Empire--whose early victories had led to dwindling resources and overexpansion--reached out to a battered Republic and called for a summit on Alderaan. As the summit began, Imperial forces launched a surprise attack on Coruscant, the Republic capital. Conquering the city-world was impossible, but the Empire wreaked enormous havoc in a short period, effectively holding Coruscant hostage and forcing the Republic to agree to less-than-favorable terms.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="283590" version="1065353216">Cultured, cunning and utterly ruthless, Rycus Kilran may be the greatest naval strategist the Empire has ever seen. Born to a wealthy family with a proud military tradition, Kilran proved himself (to no one's surprise) a capable right-hand man to the Sith during the Empire's early assaults on the Brema Sector. When his Sith superior died during the Battle of Ord Ibanna, however, Kilran showed that he was more than an able tactical advisor--he assumed command of the ragged Imperial fleet and led it to a swift and decisive victory.

In the years that followed, Kilran's authority grew with his list of triumphs, and both the Sith and the Minister of War learned respect for his unorthodox strategies. His brutally effective strikes during the final days of the war earned him the nickname &quot;the Butcher of Coruscant&quot; among Republic civilians (a name he adopted with characteristic irony), and his heroic stand against a Jedi boarding party earned him his scars. After the war ended, he was granted the honorary title &quot;Grand Moff&quot; in recognition of his contributions.</text>

Location: Balmorra
Date: Classified
Primary: Cipher Nine
Secondary: Station Chief Lekern Renald, Sanju Pyne

Operational Summary: Planet Balmorra hosted anti-Imperial terrorist cell--part of the Eagle's network. Cell specialized in recruitment and training of terrorist assets; assets would gain experience as part of Balmorra's resistance before being sent to support cells elsewhere in the galaxy.

By infiltrating the local cell, Cipher Nine successfully neutralized the terrorist leader Gray Star (see details for method and suggested follow-up). Cost of infiltration was within acceptable range.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="335790" version="1065353216">If not for the tall tales of desert nomads and a few grainy satellite reconnaissance images, Tatooine's so-called &quot;Sand Demon&quot; would be considered a myth. Jawas say the Sand Demon is feared by all other life on the planet, including the mighty krayt dragon--for the Sand Demon is the krayt's only predator. Some stories report that the beast is capable of &quot;sand swimming,&quot; gliding underneath the surface of the desert as if it were water. Others claim it bores through rock using its hardened, talon-like legs.

Cave paintings suggest the Sand People believe the Sand Demon devours the life essence of its victims, growing stronger and tougher with each kill. They depict stories of centuries-old demons that have become immune to injury, a warning heeded by even the most skeptical outsiders.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="335861" version="1065353216">The diminutive and studious Drall are native to one of five inhabited worlds in the Corellian system and have been part of everyday life on Corellia itself for thousands of years. The Drall have long been Corellia's most trusted and respected record keepers--it is rumored that even the planet's crime lords rely on these small furry creatures for accurate accounting, and every library and museum of note keeps at least one Drall archivist on staff.

Despite their animalistic appearance, Drall are highly intelligent beings of refined tastes. They are deeply respectful of others and expect to be treated in kind. The Drall are not a violent species and possess little military training, but their detailed knowledge of Corellia is proving invaluable to Republic forces.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="335863" version="1065353216">Esh-kha</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="335863" version="1065353216">According to ancient warnings carved into the walls of Belsavis prison, the Esh-kha were once one of the most feared species in the galaxy. In the distant past, they rose from their isolated homeworld and cut a swath of destruction across countless systems. Entire species were hunted to extinction.

This marauding was only stopped when the Rakata &quot;Infinite Empire,&quot; which had lost dozens of its slave worlds to the Esh-kha, mustered its titanic military against them. The Esh-kha were imprisoned in stasis beneath the surface of Belsavis--conscious, but immobile--and left in darkness for thousands of years.

Since the security of Belsavis has begun breaking down, the Esh-kha have resumed their campaign of ruthless expansion and zealous combat. They appear devoted to releasing all of their kin on the planet, and spreading as much chaos as possible in the ancient prison. With every hour that passes, they recover more technology and strange weapons; it is only a matter of time before they take to the stars again.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="335865" version="1065353216">Gormak</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="335865" version="1065353216">An aggressive species of humanoids found exclusively on the world of Voss, the Gormak have an amazing ability to comprehend highly advanced technology and adapt it to their specific needs. From bits of scavenged electronics and discarded equipment, they can construct tools, machinery...  even deadly weapons and cybernetic implants.

Aside from their affinity for technology, the Gormak's most notable feature is their hatred of the Voss species. The Gormak view the Voss as abominations that must be purged from their homeworld, and they are quick to extend this animosity to newcomers from the Republic and the Empire--like the Voss, these newcomers are all &quot;outsiders.&quot;

The Gormak population is estimated to be in the millions, spread across the planet, but so far their tribal, warlike nature has kept them from uniting against the Voss. Yet over the centuries, the Voss have had to constantly fight against the Gormak to survive--and developed a hatred just as strong as the Gormak's.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="335878" version="1065353216">Talz</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="335878" version="1065353216">The Talz are a strong, warlike and clannish species, ideally suited (due to their copious fur) to fighting in cold-weather climates. Their essential sense of honor and decidedly inhuman appearance brings most Talz into alignment with the Republic in the fight against the exclusionary Empire, and many Talz have joined the Republic's crack Talz commando units, battling on Hoth and in other cold-weather theaters of war.

Not all Talz believe that fighting for the Republic is the correct course, however. There are those whose bloodlust is not satisfied by taking out the targets the Republic assigns them, and who feel that they betray their clan by adopting a foreign master.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="335880" version="1065353216">Voss</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="335880" version="1065353216">The Voss are a newly discovered humanoid species with a strong affinity for the Force--though they don't recognize it as the Force. Confined to a single city, Voss-Ka, on their homeworld, they possessed a pre-spaceflight level of technology until their recent discovery by the Republic and the Empire. Today, they have begun integrating outsider advances into their own culture, but remain isolated and backward compared to the rest of the galaxy.

Voss society is difficult for outsiders to comprehend, as they are guided in everything they do by the infallible visions of their Force-using Mystics. This unwavering obedience is often misinterpreted as a stoic fatalism or a lack of emotion, but beneath their reserved words and placid exterior the Voss are a passionate and devoted people.

The Voss share their world with the far larger Gormak population, and considered the tribal Gormak to be little more than beasts. While the Voss readily acknowledge the threat the Gormak represent to their society and constantly war against them, there is never any consideration given to wiping them out entirely--as Mystic law clearly states that the last Gormak must never die.</text>

Losing the outpost was costly for the resistance, and the Empire renamed it to remind the Balmorran people of the consequences of defiance.

Camp Conquest now serves as a forward base and prison camp for the Empire, housing several command and control centers alongside holding cells for high-value prisoners. Well-guarded by turrets and shields and boasting a significant terrain advantage, the camp is a symbol of Imperial oppression and domination.</text>

Before the Imperials set up camp, the area was occasionally referred to as Ghost Town, as every last inhabitant had been massacred during the Imperial invasion. Buildings were left abandoned and damage sustained to the town went unrepaired, leaving it a graveyard of scrap metal and scorched ground.</text>

In fact, although his soldiering and his bravery are beyond question, Pierce has faced resistance and scrutiny throughout his military career due to his occasionally reckless attitude and his disdain for authority.

Fortunately, Pierce's years in military black operations groups kept him away from the stuffier elements of the military hierarchy. Very often, Pierce is assigned to the most dangerous and far-flung worlds, where the Empire's primary goal is destruction--which suits the lieutenant just fine.

The stompers--a non-native species once kept in a handful of Tarisian zoos--bred, hunted and initially thrived in the post-bombardment jungles, but were soon overwhelmed by their more aggressive infected cousins.

The tarsarian devourer became king of the Tarisian food chain, and although it is impossible for sentient species to contract the mutated form of the rakghoul virus, that makes the tarsarian devourer no less feared when encountered in the wild.</text>

The Jedi had uncovered Freedon Nadd's tomb, but its sarcophagus was stolen by Naddist rebels loyal to the dead Sith Lord's teachings. With Jedi Master Arca Jeth captured, Ulic Qel-Droma called for Republic forces and Onderon's capital, Iziz, was besieged.

During the battle, Satal Keto and Aleema, leaders of the Krath Sith cult, arrived on Onderon seeking Sith knowledge. They went before King Ommin, who gave Satal an amulet that would allow him to understand the ancient Sith language.

Their audience was interrupted by Ulic Qel-Droma, who sought to rescue his Master Arca Jeth from King Ommin's clutches. Satal and Aleema escaped, only to encounter the spirit of Freedon Nadd himself. Calling them the inheritors of his legacy, Nadd promised that he would lead the Krath to glory. Meanwhile, the Jedi saw Nadd's sarcophagus sealed away on Dxun, locked behind Mandalorian iron.</text>

When the Jedi teach of the dangers of pride and overreach, they often speak of Exar Kun. A promising Jedi who trained on Dantooine, Exar Kun was known for his talent and his temper. He was intensely curious about all matters of the Force, and disagreed with his Master over the dangers of the dark side. Exar Kun believed he was strong enough to study the dark side without being corrupted by it. 

Denied access to dark side teachings, however, Exar Kun left the Jedi in disgust. When he heard the Jedi had sealed the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd's sarcophagus away on the jungle moon of Dxun, he went to Dxun to seek the tomb. 

Breaking through the tomb's seals, Exar Kun was confronted by the spirit of Freedon Nadd. Impressed by his power, Nadd told Exar Kun to journey to the Sith holy world of Korriban.</text>

Since their grueling campaign against the Nevoota, the Mandalorians had only grown in power, cutting a swathe through the galaxy in search of worthy opponents. When the Mandalorians besieged the planet Basilisk, the Basiliskans--reptilian droid-builders and legendary technologists--learned that the stories of Mandalorian battle prowess were true.

Realizing they couldn't win even with Republic aid, the Basiliskans chemically poisoned their own world, hoping to take their conquerors with them. But the Mandalorians were victorious nonetheless, enslaving the Basiliskans and eventually turning them into mindless beasts of war.

More importantly, the Mandalorians captured many of the unique droids that the Basiliskans created. After this conquest, they were able to mass-produce the droids for themselves. Centuries later, the Mandalorians' Basilisk war droids would become a legendary terror during the Mandalorian Wars.</text>

The people of Empress Teta soon rebelled against the Sith regime. Alerted to the danger, the Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma and his lover, the wise and gentle Nomi, traveled to the system at the head of a Republic fleet. But the Krath cultists were fanatics; a Krath suicide attack damaged the Republic flagship, leaving Ulic Qel-Droma badly injured, and the fleet was forced to withdraw.</text>

The spirit of Freedon Nadd spoke to Exar Kun again, promising he would rescue the young Jedi if he gave himself to the dark side. Still believing he was strong enough to resist the dark side's lure, Exar Kun gave his word and power filled his body. 

The cave-in was blasted away and Exar Kun's injuries healed, but his promise had taken him much further into darkness. He left Korriban and, on Nadd's advice, made his way to the forgotten world of Yavin Four.</text>

The Sith Krath cult had become a menace, attempting to seize the Empress Teta system and repelling a Republic fleet. Knowing the shadow of the dark side lay over the Krath, the Jedi called a conclave on the planet Deneba to discuss their next course of action. Ulic Qel-Droma suggested a risky plan: infiltrating the Krath from within.

Many disagreed, believing such a course was reckless and dangerous. During the debate, the gathering was ambushed by Krath war droids. The Jedi rallied and managed to fight the droids off, but among the casualties was one of the Jedi's wisest Masters. Arca Jeth was dead. 

Ulic Qel-Droma, Arca Jeth's student, was devastated by his death. Full of grief and hatred for the Krath, Ulic swore to destroy the cultists, not seeing that his desire for revenge was leading him down a dangerous path.</text>

Ulic Qel-Droma had seen his beloved Master Arca Jeth cut down by the Sith Krath cult. Grieving and angry, he ignored the advice of his brother Cay and his lover Nomi and resolved to destroy the Krath from within. 

Posing as a fallen Jedi, Ulic made his way to the Empress Teta system. After foiling an assassination attempt on Aleema, one of the Krath founders, Ulic was taken into the cult's ranks. However, the second founder, Satal Keto, remained suspicious of Ulic. 

Over months, Ulic became immersed in the Krath teachings, even becoming Aleema's lover. Eventually, the concerned Jedi sent a team to bring Ulic home. During the rescue attempt, Ulic dueled Satal in anger, blaming him for his Master's death. Although the Jedi were able to escape, the now truly fallen Ulic chose to remain with the Krath, taking Satal's place as the cult's leader .</text>

On the advice of the spirit of the Sith Lord Freedon Nadd, the fallen Jedi Exar Kun traveled to the jungle moon of Yavin Four and encountered the Massassi--the primitive servants of the dead Sith Naga Sadow. The Massassi took Exar Kun prisoner and prepared to sacrifice him to a monstrous wyrm.

Exar Kun was forced to use his growing connection to the dark side to free himself. Freedon Nadd appeared once more, congratulating his student. But Exar Kun had tired of Nadd's meddling and used his newfound strength to obliterate Nadd's spirit. Cowed, the Massassi bowed before Exar Kun as his slaves.

Exar Kun's power grew. He ordered the Massassi to build immense temples and to seek out Naga Sadow's lost battleship. He also used Sith alchemy to create horrific monsters, including terentateks that hungered for the blood of Force users. But powerful as he was, he could sense a distant rival: Ulic Qel-Droma.</text>

It was then that the Dark Jedi Exar Kun arrived at Cinnagar's royal palace. From Yavin Four, Exar Kun had sensed Ulic's growing dark power and saw him as a threat. The two men clashed in a ferocious duel until the spirit of Marka Ragnos, a long-dead Sith Lord, appeared to them.

Ragnos commanded Ulic Qel-Droma and Exar Kun to join forces; together, they could bring about the long-prophesied Golden Age of the Sith. With Exar Kun as Dark Lord and Ulic as his apprentice, the Brotherhood of the Sith was born.</text>

Focused on strategy, Ulic contacted the Mandalorians, whose leader, Mandalore, had challenged the Krath cult's rule of the Empress Teta system. Ulic defeated Mandalore in a duel, and the Mandalorians rallied under his banner. 

Exar Kun also gave Ulic a terrible weapon--the Dark Reaper, which was capable of drawing out the life essence of an entire army. Ulic tested the Dark Reaper against Republic troops on Raxus Prime, killing hundreds. With the Dark Reaper, Mandalorian Crusaders, the Massassi warriors and Exar Kun's own horrific alchemical creations, the Brotherhood of the Sith was finally ready to challenge the Republic.</text>

As Taris's alien population took to the Lower City, Transport Station Five was built to serve their expanding needs.

When the planet was bombarded in the Jedi Civil War, transport stations on the upper levels of Taris were incinerated and turned to rubble. Now only the ruins of Transport Station Five remain intact, a ghostly reminder of a planet once teeming with life.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357415" version="1065353216">Translated directly from the original Mando'a, Geroya be Haran literally means &quot;game of annihilation&quot;--though the challenge is anything but a game. While Mandalorians often engage in lethal duels to settle matters of honor, death in such a contest does no injury to a Mandalorian's legacy. To be challenged and to lose the game of annihilation isn't just to die--it is to have every accomplishment, every honor and every memory wiped away as if none had ever existed. Geroya be Haran is the gravest challenge a Mandalorian can issue.

The Geroya be Haran is so rarely invoked that the tradition's origin has been lost to time. However, many believe that it is the symbolic retelling of one of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders' most absolute victories during the Mandalorian Wars.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357425" version="1065353216">The Republic government's relationship with Balmorra's people has been a complex, turbulent affair. Before Balmorra's conquest, the planet was a proudly independent trading partner of the Republic; when the war came to Balmorra's doorstep, the Republic offered troops and ships to help protect its ally.

But Republic protection wasn't enough. Balmorra was conquered, and after the Treaty of Coruscant the Republic officially withdrew its forces. For years afterward, small contingents of Republic troops left behind on the planet continued supporting the resistance in secret, but the Balmorran citizenry, as a whole, felt misused and abandoned.

A recent covert operation involving small groups of SIS agents, Jedi and military advisors ended in disaster when the Empire hunted down these interlopers and forced the Republic to once again abandon the oppressed citizenry. Now that the Republic military has fully committed its forces to the planet, the resistance fighters and their government-in-exile are understandably wary of fully embracing the alliance.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357431" version="1065353216">One of the great conundrums facing modern war strategists is how to defend a planet from orbital bombardment without encircling it in a costly permanent defense fleet. Most major governments employ planetary shields as a countermeasure, but these offer no protection against dropships bearing armies whose first objective is to destroy shield generators.

The war technologists of Balmorra spent decades researching an offensive method of protecting their planet. The result is the Barrager superweapon, a series of planetary scale turbolasers that can target and destroy whole enemy fleets in orbit, neutralizing both bombardment vessels and landing parties in one fell swoop.

For years, the primary obstacle preventing completion of the Barrager was the enormous power costs associated with such a weapon. How its engineers overcame this dilemma is unknown, but at last report the weapon was nearly ready to go online.</text>

Offworld refugees from across the galaxy petitioned for the chance to be among Taris's first settlers. Republic politicians eagerly publicized the humanitarian resettlement and showered the lucky colonists with gifts of aid. Although there were severe difficulties early on, the refugees eventually took root and thrived.

But the flourishing recolonization was not to last. The shadows of an Imperial fleet soon blotted out the sky, and as the sunlight faded so too did any hope for the Tarisian settlers. Thousands fled into the Republic military's protective arms, while more pessimistic settlers abandoned Taris entirely. The Cathar and Nikto colonists, however, refused to move. Taris was their new home, and they are prepared to die defending it.</text>

While there are those content to scavenge the ruins and sell their findings offworld, others find it easier to simply take the valuable salvage at blaster-point.

Although once at odds with the pirate and scavenger gangs, the Republic recently brought a group of these dangerous thugs into line, dragging their operations into the realm of legality and enlisting them in the reconstruction effort. With the Empire's invasion, the gangs have had little choice but to flee the planet or become a brutal mercenary force--protecting their investment by slaughtering any Imperial troops they can trap, ambush or murder.</text>

Renowned as Jedi-killers, the Morgukai are often courted by the Empire--frequently unsuccessfully, as the cult has a strong sense of honor and is keenly aware that the Empire views Nikto as a lesser species. In truth, many Morgukai view Sith as unfavorably as they view Jedi.

Fighting with cortosis weapons built to survive the blow of any lightsaber, Morgukai rely on a master-student relationship to train new initiates. Beyond their incredible abilities in combat, however, the philosophical teachings of the Morgukai cult are a mystery--they do not speak of their beliefs to outsiders, even under threat of death.</text>

When Thana discovered her talent with the Force, she tested her destructive talents on her military parents' bodyguards. After the eighth guard was found broken and mangled, Thana's terrified parents tried to suppress their daughter's power; Thana lashed out, and the resulting devastation burned an entire Kaas City block to the ground.

Thana's parents were consumed in the blaze and their Force-adept orphan was sent to the Sith Academy on Korriban. The incident was widely publicized as an example of the terrible fate of parents who fear, rather than embrace, a potential Sith child.

Thana tore through her Sith trials and fellow acolytes at lightning speed, earning the attention of Darth Gravus. When her studies concluded, the elder Sith Lord took Thana on as his apprentice with the promise that she would finally sink her teeth into the Republic in the jungles of Taris.</text>

Ashara came to Taris to train under Jedi Masters Ryen and Ocera, whose philosophy is that Padawans best learn the travails of using the Force through firsthand experience of the galaxy. In Ashara's case, the Masters brought her to Taris for two reasons: First, to teach her compassion amidst the destruction that had occurred there and warn against the dangers of pride and the dark side. Second, to complete her trials by helping to drive a dark ghost from the ruins of a Jedi enclave.

Dislikes: Ideology, honesty, selfish actions without clear long-term gain

Personal History: Age and surname suggest Lokin was born on Dromund Kaas during the pre-war years. Files acquired during Operation: Freefall reference a &quot;Doctor E. Lokin&quot; working as Science and Medical Advisor to Kaas City military police during this period, but no visual is provided.

First confirmed sighting was during the boarding of Imperial dreadnought Warhammer--Lokin was one of the two individuals aboard who evaded capture. Interestingly, he was not listed in the crew roster. First identification as Fixer Fifteen came during Operation: Red Cell (see listening post transcripts). Additional sightings and references to the Fixer Fifteen designation uncovered intermittently since.

Analysis: Take a close look at the operations where we caught Lokin, and you'll notice a pattern--every time he turns up, something big is happening and we can't figure the role he's playing. He's professional, he knows his science and he's sneaky. We know he rubs some of his colleagues the wrong way, but even his fellow agents haven't given us anything useful under questioning.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357458" version="1065353216">Once an honored leader of a respected clan, the man known as Jicoln Cadera is now nothing but a specter--the lingering memory of a dark time for the Mandalorians.

When the warrior Artus claimed the title of Mandalore and called the clans to fight alongside the Empire, Jicoln refused. He would not serve the enemy his ancestors had spent generations waiting for--the Empire that he was born to oppose--and his defiance incited others to rally to his side. The gauntlet had been thrown, and only bloodshed would determine the future of the clans. 

History ultimately favored Artus, his victory over Jicoln's rebels legitimizing his bid to rule and earning him the title Mandalore the Vindicated. But Artus and Jicoln share a history beyond these campfire stories--one only the two of them know.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357470" version="1065353216">A powerful Sith Lord with a despotic temperament, Darth Lachris has never failed in war. Her successes in the Empire's battles have brought her to Balmorra, where she faces the challenge of putting down a resistance that has remained one step ahead of the military since the fight for the planet began.

Darth Lachris is sharp and wary, expecting a scheme behind every action her enemies take. Trained by Dark Council member Darth Marr, she is a warrior at heart with an embittered understanding of political necessity--and a lust for all the galaxy's bloody pleasures.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="357475" version="1065353216">Zenith (Consular)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357475" version="1065353216">&quot;Zenith&quot; is the code name of a Balmorran revolutionary fighter who has made a career out of hurting the Empire. Once a member of a powerful resistance cell broken up by Imperial infiltrators, Zenith has struck out on his own, gathering followers from Balmorra's oppressed population to launch sneak attacks, raids and bombings against the occupying Imperial forces. 

Years spent in hiding and seeing the plight of Balmorran citizens have left Zenith with a deep-seated paranoia and hatred of the Empire--especially Balmorra's Sith governor, Darth Lachris. Nothing enrages him more than those who collaborate with the oppressors; he has been known to refuse aid to Balmorrans who cooperate with Imperial soldiers. The sacrifices he has endured have also nurtured Zenith's ambitions--when Balmorra is finally free, someone will have to ensure her new government is strong enough to prevent another occupation.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="357481" version="1065353216">Doc (Knight)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357481" version="1065353216">The brilliant medtech known simply as &quot;Doc&quot; is driven to bring quality health care to underserved star systems. This has led Doc to keep some unusual company: pathosis-riddled crime lord Fashaka Four-Toes, the Red Band Rebels of Cadinth and even the Imperial military during a brief stint impersonating a member of the Imperial Medical Corps on the conquered planet Sullust.

Doc has a talent for using bad people to save good lives--a fact he emphasizes to anyone within earshot. Some characterize Doc as a blowhard and scoundrel, but these individuals have never required his impressive surgical skills. Doc has visited every major galactic battleground over the past five years and saved more lives than even he can count.

Likes: Looking like a hero, romance and flirtation, helping those in need

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357483" version="1065353216">Warren Sedoru was already one of the most acclaimed Jedi Knights of the order when the Sith Empire attacked the Republic at Korriban. He was one of the first Jedi to lead a counterattack against Imperial forces and scored several early victories against them. The price of these triumphs was high, however.

Records indicate Warren was critically injured over a dozen times in battles from Alderaan to Yavin Four. Although he survived these near-deaths without need of cybernetic replacement parts, Warren's connection to the Force began to diminish. When the Republic signed the Treaty of Coruscant, Warren dedicated himself wholeheartedly to peace. He gave up his rank as Jedi Knight and became a Padawan to Master Tol Braga.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="357484" version="1065353216">Numen Brock (Smuggler)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357484" version="1065353216">The petty thief and underworld fence Numen Brock spent his formative years helping Balmorran criminals smuggle high-tech weapons to offworld crime syndicates. That all changed the day Numen met the Balmorran resistance and discovered his inner patriot. He soon became a folk hero to the guerilla fighters by using his underworld contacts to obtain food and weaponry for the rebellion.

Numen's victories attracted the Republic's attention, and undercover SIS agents on Balmorra seized on the opportunity to use his smuggling network to aid the resistance without openly engaging in the war. Numen views the Republic with a genial cynicism, perfectly willing to take what its representatives give as long as they understand he's still his own man.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357485" version="1065353216">Akaavi Spar was born into a respected Mandalorian clan and became one of its finest warriors. She killed her first foe--an abusive Abyssin mercenary--at the age of eight using an improvised flamethrower. This victory earned her the nickname &quot;firehand&quot; among her clan and marked the beginning of an impressive career as an Imperial bounty hunter. Akaavi captured and killed all manner of targets in her youth, from career criminals to Jedi.

When her entire clan was framed for crimes against the Empire and executed, Akaavi alone survived the brutal purge--but her outlook on the galaxy changed forever. With no connection to her Mandalorian heritage, she became a wandering mercenary loyal to no one.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357486" version="1065353216">One of the most talented demolitions experts to ever serve in the Republic military, Tanno Vik is charming, highly skilled and completely amoral. Born to the lawless streets of Nar Shaddaa, Vik is accustomed to putting his own interests first; enlistment was merely a convenient means of escape after betraying one criminal partner too many. But once he got his hands on the most advanced weapons and explosives in the galaxy, he was hooked.

During training, Vik impressed his instructors with his unprecedented speed at locating structural weaknesses in everything from buildings to vehicles, ensuring that he always planted his explosives where they would do the most damage. He was even considered for entry into Special Forces division, but his belligerent attitude and disregard for authority held him back. Criminal accusations were registered against him throughout his short service career, leading to his eventual conviction and discharge.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357487" version="1065353216">Millions of Balmorrans have fought and died to defend their world from the Empire's brutal conquest. Brel Orus is not one of them. 

Where other corporate leaders refused to give up their life's work to the invaders, Orus sold out immediately, securing himself a cushy bureaucratic position in the new Imperial regime. He now oversees the confiscation and storage of Balmorran corporate technologies from the comfort of the Empire's headquarters in Sobrik, safe from his fellow Balmorrans and largely unnoticed by his Imperial overlords.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="357488" version="1065353216">After the Treaty of Coruscant, the Republic set out to rebuild the demolished planet Taris and forge a symbol of renewed strength. As the operation grew, the Olaris Reclamation Base rose from the ashes and Republic forces tamed the surrounding jungle. But progress stalled after repeated setbacks in Taris's hostile wilds.

It wasn't until the arrival of Governor Saresh that Republic reconstruction finally took hold. Through sheer will and ambition, Saresh turned the reclamation around and established the Republic Resettlement Zone. As the heart of the reconstruction, this zone houses the tens of thousands of machines, administrators and soldiers that make the reclamation possible. Although Governor Saresh has since relinquished her post on Taris, the Republic Resettlement Zone still stands as a haven for the Republic and a sign of the rebirth to come.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="362644" version="1065353216">Built shortly before the Imperial invasion by the prestigious Balmorran Arms corporation, the Balmorran Arms factory is unrivaled in its weapons production and research capabilities. It was designed to construct military equipment ranging from personal arms and armor to droids and heavy vehicles, all with top-notch quality and efficiency.

Due to its tremendous manufacturing capacity, the fortress-like factory was one of the last holdouts of the resistance during the Imperial invasion, providing an almost inexhaustible supply of weapons and supplies to the besieged Balmorran people. Once the Empire finally gained control of the factory, however, the Imperial military wasted no time in putting the facilities to its own use.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="362645" version="1065353216">Bugtown</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="362645" version="1065353216">Once a genetic research facility called Lab 352, this complex became known as &quot;Bugtown&quot; after the Colicoids--mutated insectoids used as experimental bioweapons--were released from the facility by Imperial saboteurs. The Colicoids took over the area surrounding the laboratory and began to infest the rest of the planet.

Republic forces have managed to retake the old laboratory, clearing out the Colicoids and establishing a forward outpost. While much of the Colicoid infestation remains, the population has been contained by the Imperial and Republic fighting; for now, the Republic can keep its unorthodox base.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="362655" version="1065353216">Another victim of the Empire's many acts of sabotage during its initial invasion, the Okara Droid factory was one of the most productive droid manufacturers on Balmorra. Imperial technicians uploaded a virus into the automated factory's system, turning its military droids against the Balmorran population. But the virus was too successful--the droids fully secured the factory and continued production, forcing the Empire to take it back through military action.

Now, after several hard-fought battles, Imperial soldiers have moved into the factory and established a base of operations there. Technicians are hard at work reversing the damage they caused, and hope to resume production of military droids to supplement the occupation force.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="362656" version="1065353216">Imperial Subjugation</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="362656" version="1065353216">The Empire's long occupation of Balmorra has been marked by overt brutality against the citizenry and near-constant battles with resistance forces. Although the planet was conquered through ingenuity and highly original tactics, the subjugation of its people has followed standard Imperial doctrine: suspension of civil liberties, establishment of brutal prison camps and summary public executions of known rebels.

Where most worlds crumble into slave-like obedience after only a few months of such oppression, Balmorra's people refuse to surrender after years of suffering. The resistance has outlasted the predictions of both the Republic and Empire and survived multiple purges carried out by ambitious Moffs and sadistic Sith Lords. Indeed, the Empire's experience on Balmorra has forced it to re-evaluate its approach to conquest and dominance.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="362657" version="1065353216">Troida Military Workshop</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="362657" version="1065353216">For most of the Imperial occupation, the Troida Military Workshop kept supplies and goods flowing into Imperial headquarters in Sobrik. Balmorran resistance members often staged raids on Troida convoys, denying the Empire resources while securing much-needed supplies for themselves. But Troida's workers--ordinary citizens forced to work under Imperial oppression--also harbored resistance leanings, resentful that their independent company answered only to the Empire's directives.

As the resistance on Balmorra crumbled, Troida became a rallying point for surviving resistance fighters. Imperial control was cast off, and now the workshop is the largest remaining base for the persistent Balmorran freedom fighters.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="362662" version="1065353216">Balmorran Resistance</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="362662" version="1065353216">Balmorra's resistance fighters are more than patriotic guerilla warriors. People from all walks of life, from farmers and teachers to poets and musicians, risk everything to keep the dream of Balmorran freedom alive. Part of the Empire's lack of success rooting out these rebels is due to an inability to detect such nondescript enemies until it is too late.

Over the years, thousands of ordinary people have made the ultimate sacrifice for Balmorra, learning to hoist a blaster, training in burnt-out factories and toxic wastelands, and willingly dying to strike a blow against the hated Empire. To much of the citizenry, the resistance is made up of heroes--friends and neighbors who refused to suffer in silence. Other Balmorrans, however, wish the resistance would fade away, and believe it is past time to peacefully accept Imperial governance.</text>

While not Rakatan, the device bears striking similarities to the design methodologies of the Infinite Empire.  Such technology, while not unheard of in the known regions, is spectacularly rare.  

Ancient records indicate that assemblers, such as these, were instrumental in shifting the crystalline resonance that powers traditional holocrons so that the devices can be accessed and utilized by anyone - regardless of force sensitivity.  When and how this innovation was developed is unknown, however the age of the few assemblers recovered, puts the development of this technology around the time of the first Jedi Exodus.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="386615" version="1065353216">General Redrish proved that her talent for swaying the loyalties of others wasn't exaggerated, convincing the Mystics of the Shrine of Healing to come to her aid by taking &lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt; prisoner. Not easily overcome, &lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt; proved too strong for the shrine's guardians and forced them to reveal that General Redrish left for the Gormak lands.</text>

Although the Dark Lord Exar Kun was gone, traces of his evil remained. Exar Kun had been a master of Sith alchemy and his monstrous terentateks had thrived--reshaped and empowered to hunt Force-sensitives. After the Great Sith War, the Jedi Council sent three Jedi--Shaela Nuur, Guun Han Saresh and Duron Qel-Droma--to hunt these beasts down.

Initially close friends, the three Jedi began to quarrel as the hunt went on. Guun Han Saresh disapproved of Duron and Shaela's budding romance and left the group. He later perished in the Kashyyyk Shadowlands, trying to fight a terentatek alone.

Meanwhile, Duron and Shaela pursued two terentateks in the tombs of Korriban, but Duron was killed by one of the beasts. Stricken by grief and rage, Shaela tried to take on both beasts by herself but was overwhelmed, ending the terentatek hunt.</text>

Distracted by the Great Sith War, the Republic had overlooked growing dissent on the planet Argazda. Its provisional governor, Myrial, declared the Kanz Sector independent of the Republic and established a totalitarian regime. She began attacking and enslaving nearby worlds, including Lorrd. 

Many protested the Republic's refusal to take action against Argazda, but the Republic was in no position to begin another war so soon after destroying the Brotherhood of the Sith. Even as the Republic rebuilt, the Mandalorian Wars and subsequent conflicts would prevent it from taking up arms against Argazda for another three hundred years.</text>

Ulic Qel-Droma had vanished into exile a broken man. His fate was discussed at the Jedi Convocation on Exis Station, led by his former lover, Nomi. As the order debated how to rebuild, Sylvar, whose mate had died in the Great Sith War, called for Ulic to be harshly punished. Her demands were refused.

After the convocation, Vima, Nomi's daughter, sought Ulic out on Rhen Var and asked him to train her as a Jedi. Although reluctant, Ulic agreed for Nomi's sake. Bent on revenge, however, Sylvar had paid a scavenger to track Ulic down.

Sylvar brought Nomi to Rhen Var where they confronted Ulic, but Vima persuaded them to forgive him. The scavenger, Hoggon, had other ideas and shot Ulic in the back. Ulic's body vanished into the Force, allowing the Jedi Order to finally focus on healing.</text>

The fall of Exar Kun and the destruction caused by the Great Sith War weighed heavily on the consciences of many Jedi. The Jedi seer Krynda Draay, who had lost her husband in the conflict, blamed herself for not foreseeing Exar Kun's corruption as a Sith Lord and decided to take action. Having trained the order's visionaries for years, she secretly created a Jedi Covenant without the Council's knowledge, binding the most powerful Jedi seers into a WatchCircle.

The Covenant's task was simple: Watch for Sith influences and eliminate them before they became a threat. Funded by Krynda Draay's vast family wealth, the Covenant quietly recruited Jedi--usually those believed missing in action--as its shadows and operatives and sought out Sith artifacts to destroy. Meanwhile, its seers remained vigilant, watching through the Force for any approaching evil.</text>

The Mandalorians had suffered not only defeat but humiliation in the Great Sith War. After their leader, Mandalore the Indomitable, crash-landed on Dxun and was devoured by wild beasts at the war's end, a new warrior rose to take his place, later called &quot;Mandalore the Ultimate.&quot;

Deciding to bring in new blood, Mandalore opened the ranks of the Mandalorian Crusaders--once dominated by the followers of the ancient Taung, now fielding alien recruits. Calling themselves Neo-Crusaders, these warriors adopted traditional Mandalorian armor and training. Mandalore established a base on Dxun, testing his warriors against Dxun's infamous predators.

As their ranks grew, the Neo-Crusaders began to conquer worlds weakened in the Great Sith War. Later Jedi would believe Sith influences propelled the Mandalorians into war, but the Mandalorians themselves claimed to be driven only by the chance for conquest and revenge.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390659" version="1065353216">The Republic established its primary military lodgment, Aurek Base, in the Whiterock Wastes sector with cooperation from the nearby Ortolan settlement in Crescent Canyon. The Ortolans aided the Republic military's engineers and helped construct their mountain fortress in return for protection from the White Maw pirates.

Had Republic military strategists foreseen the Empire's real plan--not to claim technology from the starship graveyard, but to draw Republic forces into an unwinnable fight--they might have reconsidered establishing anything in the Whiterock Wastes. The vast snowy plains stretching out from the mountain base provide unimpeded access to enemy forces. In retrospect, the Empire's violent invasion of the Whiterock Wastes was inevitable.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390662" version="1065353216">Crescent Canyon Facility</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390662" version="1065353216">The Crescent Canyon Facility was established decades ago by the Czerka Corporation to explore mining opportunities beneath Hoth's frozen tundra. The operation was eventually deemed too costly to pursue and Czerka personnel abandoned the sprawling base. Later, Ortolan explorers seeking to establish a permanent settlement on Hoth moved in and took over the structures.

The current conflict between Republic, Empire and White Maw has turned the facility into a battle zone. Reports indicate the Empire has invaded and enslaved the helpless Ortolans living there. Because of the facility's proximity to the Republic's Aurek Base, an immediate and strong military response is required.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390663" version="1065353216">Icefall Plains</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390663" version="1065353216">When the Empire's forces scouted Hoth for a landing site, both Imperial and Chiss tacticians agreed that the Icefall Plains sector was the best location for a military staging ground. The easy but defensible access to White Maw pirate territory rendered it ideal for both offensive sorties and a defensive fallback. More importantly, once the Republic committed to Hoth and the salvage operation in the starship graveyard, it would become the perfect place from which to launch assaults and drag out the conflict forever.

Dorn Base, the heavily defended main Imperial complex, is protected by powerful shield generators and turrets. A series of smaller forward bases stand ready to alert commanders of any impending assault. Nonetheless, Republic commandos have made extensive inroads into the sector and now threaten to isolate the Icefall Plains from resupply and reinforcements.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390664" version="1065353216">Highmount Ridge</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390664" version="1065353216">Initially home to Ortolan settlers, the Highmount Ridge sector is now contested territory where both Republic and Imperial military units contend with the White Maw pirate army. These deadly cutthroats have seized control of an extensive geothermal plant, giving them a well-defended staging area from which to conduct their assaults.

Fierce battles rage on the ridge's open areas, making the sector especially dangerous for travel. White Maw ambushes are common, but Republic and Imperial forces are managing to hold their own and establish footholds in the territory. Whether or not they can keep these positions is another matter.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390665" version="1065353216">Tromper Crags Geothermal Plant</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390665" version="1065353216">The Ortolan settlers on Hoth needed a renewable energy source to power their habitat in the Crescent Canyon Facility and help them expand their territory, so Ortolan engineers constructed a massive geothermal plant tapping directly into Hoth's underground volcano network. The Tromper Crags plant provided more than adequate power and heat to keep the Ortolans in relative comfort... until the White Maw came.

The pirate army's leaders understood the value of controlling the most abundant power resource on Hoth and quickly stormed the geothermal plant. Any Ortolans who did not immediately submit to White Maw authority were summarily executed. Now that the Republic and Empire have come to Hoth, the Tromper Crags facility has become hotly contested territory.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390666" version="1065353216">Glacial Fissure</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390666" version="1065353216">The sector designated as the Glacial Fissure is almost entirely White Maw territory. The deep ice canyons and extensive underground cave networks provide shelter and staging areas for the vicious pirate forces. When the White Maw's leaders saw the Republic and Imperial militaries arriving on Hoth, they immediately established well-defended camps and supply routes throughout the area.

Traveling through the Glacial Fissure is suicide for all but the most well-armed and highly trained operatives. The White Maw pirates do not fight conventionally, preferring to set ambushes and traps for their victims. Both the Republic and Imperial militaries have sustained heavy losses here, demonstrating the extraordinary threat the pirates represent.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390668" version="1065353216">The Hailstorm Brotherhood is a fringe group of White Maw pirates who abandoned the starship graveyard's plunder to form a permanent settlement on Hoth. These men and women are more than mere survivalists, however. They are artisans and warrior-poets shaping Hoth's natural landscape according to their own designs.

The massive ice spire towering above the Glacial Fissure sector was painstakingly carved from an ancient mountain by the Hailstorm Brotherhood. No one knows how many of the group's members perished making the spire a reality, but the achievement stands as a testament to these warriors' iron wills--and a warning to all who might oppose them.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390670" version="1065353216">Among the Empire's losses in Hoth's fabled space battle was a sleek, fast warship designated the Ambria's Fury. Until recently, the ship's manifest had remained a mystery to all but the highest Imperial echelons. The only certainty was that the Imperial Moffs were most distressed at the ship's loss.

The wreck of the Ambria's Fury was recently discovered by Imperial and Republic forces, prompting a rush to secure the crash site and recover whatever secrets the ship has kept for so many years....</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390673" version="1065353216">Starship Graveyard</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390673" version="1065353216">Decades ago, Imperial starships led the Republic fleet into a deadly trap above the remote ice planet of Hoth. The Republic's fabled prototype superdreadnought, the Star of Coruscant, was the Empire's primary target, but many other warships suffered the same terrible fate. The remains of these vessels fell to the planet's surface in a tightly-packed radius, creating an awe-inspiring graveyard of derelict ships.

Republic vessels were not the only victims of this devastating space battle, however. Several noteworthy Imperial ships were also destroyed, their cracked hulls raining down among the enemy's remains. Years of heavy snowfall and shifting ice have obscured the many wrecks to the point that sorting Republic from Imperial ships is often an impossible task.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390676" version="1065353216">Star of Coruscant</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390676" version="1065353216">The greatest prize in Hoth's starship graveyard is a behemoth of a vessel called the Star of Coruscant. At the time of its crash, this superdreadnought was the most advanced ship in the Republic fleet--a project years in the making, shepherded along by one Colonel Omas. Its experimental weapons and breakthrough technology could have turned the war's tide, had the Empire not devoted every resource to trapping and destroying it.

Not even the long fall from orbit to Hoth's hard-packed ice plains could shatter the Star of Coruscant's hull. The ship remains intact, and White Maw pirates have spent considerable effort reactivating its internal power systems and shields. Indeed, the ship is now a veritable fortress on the planet's surface.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390678" version="1065353216">Clabburn Tundra</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390678" version="1065353216">The Clabburn Tundra sector has become a key battleground in the three-way war for Hoth. The rolling snow dunes of the drift hills and the spectacular frozen geysers of the jagged plains were initially claimed by the Republic military, which saw the region as an excellent artillery staging area. However, strategic mismanagement allowed both White Maw and Imperial forces to invade and establish their own camps.

Recent reports indicate some of Hoth's most hostile wildlife calls the Clabburn Tundra home, and these beasts are not happy to see their habitat invaded. Whitefangs, wampas and even the occasional tribe of attacking skels prey upon whole squads of soldiers.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390689" version="1065353216">Hoth's natural predators, pirates and military forces are nothing compared to its weather. Intense cold remains the greatest danger to anyone unlucky enough to travel on the planet, and many manuals have been written on how to keep warm, offering tips on taking advantage of rare nodes of geothermal energy when staking out camp and how to rely on underground cave systems to keep out of the wind.

Specialist cold-weather gear has been designed to allow survival in short bursts on Hoth's bitterly cold surface. In the absence of such gear, one guide even suggests that--in the event of becoming stranded in one of Hoth's famous whiteouts--the innards of a freshly slaughtered pack animal or predator can provide enough heat to stretch out survival for a few hours.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390691" version="1065353216">The Battle of Hoth</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390691" version="1065353216">During the height of the Great War, a vital battle was fought above Hoth--a battle many credit with forcing the Republic to accept the terms of the Treaty of Coruscant. It began when Imperial Intelligence uncovered evidence of a massive Republic fleet buildup near Hoth. Prototype battle cruisers constructed with cutting edge technology formed the backbone of an armada hundreds of ships strong--an armada believed to have been designed for a full-scale invasion of the Imperial capital world of Dromund Kaas.

The invasion never happened. The Empire moved to ambush the Republic super-fleet first. The battle raged for days and found its epicenter in the Hoth system. The greatest starships and some of the greatest warriors in both fleets were destroyed, and high technology and scorched metal rained down onto the ice fields. In the end, the Empire succeeded in its goal; the Republic had been robbed of its chance at victory, and the tide of the war turned.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390692" version="1065353216">Salvaging Starships</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390692" version="1065353216">Hoth has never been a friendly planet for spacefaring people. Its strong magnetic pull and icy atmosphere have spelled death for many a pilot, and crashed vessels have long littered the planet's surface. But after the Battle of Hoth brought huge numbers of warships down--including the Republic superdreadnought, the Star of Coruscant--Hoth became home to a massive starship graveyard. The graveyard, in turn, became a very attractive destination for pirates looking to salvage a technological edge from the wreckage.

Salvaging starships in Hoth's blizzards is a deadly occupation that can reap great rewards. One of the first pirates to scope out the starship graveyard famously made millions of credits selling Republic and Imperial weaponry back to the Republic and Empire. Now, both governments and freelancers brave Hoth's wilderness, and many salvagers meet their ends among the cold and unstable ruins of dead ships.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390694" version="1065353216">Hoth: No Place for Vehicles</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390694" version="1065353216">The bitter cold of Hoth is no friend to small vehicles, which do not generate enough heat to keep their mechanical parts from freezing and their power generators from failing on a regular basis. High-end speeders mostly avoid these issues, but mass produced military bikes and many shuttles, starfighters and other transports fail on a regular basis.

For large-scale transport of troops and supplies--when a few select, customized speeders won't suffice--two options remain. First, large vehicles such as armored walkers and heavy dropships can be outfitted to  survive the cold, so long as they are well maintained. Second, there is the tauntaun--a bipedal animal that has evolved to survive Hoth's harsh environs and to navigate even during whiteout conditions.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390695" version="1065353216">Imperial War Strategy: Quagmires</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390695" version="1065353216">The Empire, vastly outnumbered by the Republic, knows it cannot win every battle it fights--so more creative tactics are in order. By sending diversionary forces to the deadly ice world of Hoth and generating intelligence chatter about the search for a vital weapon, the Empire hopes to lure the Republic into a military quagmire--a battle the Republic cannot win, but cannot abandon due to its importance. In so doing, the Empire will divert precious Republic resources away from its true objectives.

This is not the first time the Empire has employed such a strategy. Centuries ago, during the Empire's initial expansion into the sectors surrounding Dromund Kaas, quagmires were used to effectively paralyze minor alien worlds while nearby resources were gathered. Since then, the strategy has remained a valued weapon in the Imperial military arsenal.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390696" version="1065353216">Caught Between Two Foes</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390696" version="1065353216">The Republic finds itself in the worst possible military position on Hoth as it battles both Imperial forces and White Maw pirates. Each of these enemies poses significant individual challenges; combined, they are a nightmare scenario for Republic war strategists. It appears impossible to adopt a battle plan that effectively defends against both, much less offers any hope of victory over them.

The Empire employs classic high-aggression tactics while protecting its units within heavy fortifications, while the unpredictable White Maw pirates favor hit-and-run attacks that take advantage of Hoth's natural landscape for maximum effect. Should these two enemies ever join forces, the Republic's survival on the planet would likely be measured in hours.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390697" version="1065353216">Deity of the Trandoshan species, the Scorekeeper watches over her brood, savoring their victories and shunning their failures. According to Trandoshan belief, no creature in existence is beyond her judgment, and the only means for a Trandoshan to improve his standing in her eyes is to dominate another living thing--to hold a creature's life in his claws and show the Scorekeeper that he is more worthy of survival.

The Scorekeeper's measure of worthiness is called Jagannath, and upon a being's death it is tallied by the Scorekeeper to determine his place in the afterlife. To be captured or dishonored on a hunt is to have one's Jagannath stripped by the victor, leaving nothing for the victim to show the Scorekeeper in death and dooming his spirit to oblivion.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390698" version="1065353216">Since the beginning of the Great War, one Imperial cipher has defied every attempt at decryption. Code-named &quot;Umbra,&quot; it has become a legend in the galactic cryptography community; the Republic even allowed scraps of Umbra transmissions to be released surreptitiously as &quot;unbeatable puzzles&quot; to university students in the hope of finding someone--anyone--who could crack the code.

With theoretical efforts yielding no results, the Republic eventually took on a more direct approach, launching dozens of covert missions to capture one of the Empire's Umbra encryption devices. None has succeeded.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390702" version="1065353216">Chiss Ascendancy</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390702" version="1065353216">As the only true ally of the Sith Empire, the independent systems of the isolationist Chiss Ascendancy occupy a unique position within Imperial power structures. Mandalorians serve the Empire for wealth and conquered factions submit out of fear, but the Ascendancy aligned itself with the Empire for mutual benefit. The exact details of this agreement remain a mystery to all but the highest-level Imperials and Chiss, but it effectively renders the Ascendancy a vassal state--self-governed, but a source of resources and manpower for the Empire as a whole.

The Chiss Ascendancy's internal governance mystifies most Imperials. The web of hierarchies and political influence networks that links the Chiss Ruling Houses is complex at best and impenetrable at worst, with political, family and military ties all playing a part in determining a person's role in the Ascendancy. Internal power plays are common, but always occur within the accepted boundaries of Chiss society--even at their most vicious, the Chiss always maintain order.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390704" version="1065353216">The White Maw Pirates</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390704" version="1065353216">The army of thugs, mercenaries and murderers operating beneath the White Maw banner is actually composed of many smaller pirate crews, joining forces to pillage one of the greatest &quot;buried treasures&quot; in the galaxy: Hoth's starship graveyard. As often happens in criminal confederacies built on greed and violence, members of the White Maw vie for power and settle old scores even as they battle Republic and Imperial forces.

The White Maw might have collapsed into anarchy years ago if not for its powerful leadership, a legendary group of cutthroats who rule their subordinates with a zero tolerance policy. While mutinies still occur, the risks often outweigh the rewards.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390705" version="1065353216">The Hailstorm Brotherhood</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390705" version="1065353216">Republic forces first noted a radical subgroup of the White Maw pirates when scanners detected a massive ice spire rising above the Glacial Fissure sector. Scouts sent to investigate the sculpture reported encounters with half-naked warriors wearing wampa furs and screaming poetry as they charged into battle.

The Hailstorm Brotherhood represents an extreme version of &quot;going native.&quot; Originally a murderous cult from a nameless ice planet, the brotherhood became a legend when its White Maw members relocated to Hoth, abandoning all pretenses of civilization and instead embracing the call of the wild. They are more than a tribe of survivalists, however. There is a strong spiritual aspect to the Hailstorm Brotherhood that makes them dangerously fanatical.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390706" version="1065353216">The Chiss Expansionary Defense Force is the main military power within the Chiss Ascendancy, charged with protecting the Ascendancy's borders, exploring space outside the Ascendancy proper and assisting with Imperial military operations. The Defense Force maintains ground, air and space-based divisions, but is not intended to operate on Chiss soil--internal security and homeworld ground defense are assigned elsewhere.

The Chiss believe that Defense Force personnel are the best-trained and most disciplined soldiers in the galaxy, and this claim holds some merit--Defense Force officers are held to an incredibly high standard of physical fitness and mental acuity. Imperial analysts point out, however, that these standards can only exist so long as the Chiss avoid the attrition inherent to protracted, large-scale conflicts.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390710" version="1065353216">When the pirates led by Captain Valon began raiding Rift Alliance-controlled shipping lanes, a request for help from the Republic military was answered with only a small number of soldiers due to the Republic's commitments elsewhere. Incensed, the Rift Alliance managed to call together supplementary forces from its own worlds to stop the pirates, claiming this as more proof that the Republic could no longer defend its own citizens.

While not as well-trained or equipped as standard Republic military troops, the coalition force has adapted surprisingly well to the harsh conditions on Hoth and quickly become a cohesive and flexible unit. Unfortunately, the pirates have the advantage of manpower and a detailed knowledge of the terrain. With their numbers dwindling, the coalition force has been gradually pushed back; to the beleaguered soldiers, victory has now become second to survival.</text>

While his peers spent their youths learning survival skills and playing on the frozen tundra of Alzoc Three, Broonmark developed a fascination with death. As a child, Broonmark watched his father killed by one of Alzoc Three's predators, and instead of sadness, Broonmark felt only shame at his father's weakness. Violence became an obsession and point of pride for Broonmark; he started hunting in secret and lived for the rush of a kill.

When the Republic began recruiting Talz for their elite commando units, Broonmark eagerly volunteered for the chance to turn his claws against more challenging prey. But with each kill, Broonmark's desire for carnage and bloodshed intensified. His clan soon challenged his brutal leadership, and Broonmark watched in anger as the gentle Talz he fought to empower mutinied against him.

Deeply concerned with the preservation of life and more interested in communing with the Force than in using his power as a weapon, he nonetheless proved himself in combat time and again. When his apprentice Xerender battled Darth Baras, Wyellett joined Xerender and sought to redeem the Sith; failing, Wyellett seized Baras's lightsaber and chose to use it as his own, a symbol of darkness brought into the light.

Wyellett's final heroic act was an act of self-sacrifice committed to save his Padawan Xerender and much of the Jedi Council from the legendary Starweird Queen; this resulted in his capture by the Empire. The Imperial starship that was transporting Wyellett was destroyed in the Battle of Hoth, and Master Wyellett has been believed dead all these years. In fact, Wyellett has been in a trance beneath the rubble of the fallen ship, psychically trying to reach out to his former pupil.

Blizz spent several years with Slam's crew before the old scrapper made the mistake of selling his services to Hoth's White Maw pirates. Years of toil under the menacing watch of the White Maw would soon deprive the salvagers of reasons to smile--but first, Slam gave his small friend the nickname &quot;Blizz&quot; after the little Jawa kicked up a snowstorm of excitement during his first encounter with the &quot;white sands.&quot; It's a name Blizz cherishes; one that reminds him of happier times.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390725" version="1065353216">Serpent of the Void. Sarlacc in Scales. Hunter of Worlds. There are many names for the monster that stalks the farthest reaches of space--Reneget Vause is merely the name given in his native tongue. A myth by many standards, the stories of fleets Vause has shattered and the colonies he's obliterated are numerous and pale imitations of the actual horrors he's inflicted in the name of his insatiable goddess.

Those fortunate enough to escape the Trandoshan pirate lord can attest that Vause is likely to mete out as much harm to himself as to his prey; he pursues his foes with reckless disregard for his own survival. To Vause, the Jagannath--the &quot;points&quot; scored for killing--is never so rich as when it's stolen from the brink of death.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390727" version="1065353216">Name: Raina Temple
Gender: Female
Species: Human
Age: 24
Likes: The Empire, the Sith, duty, honor
Dislikes: Cruelty, casual violence, selfishness

Primary Weapon: Dual Blaster Pistols

Personal History: Standard searches reveal no Imperial citizenship record for a &quot;Raina Temple,&quot; but the usual caveats apply--our data on the Imperial populace remains sadly incomplete. Temple's skills and attitude suggest Imperial Army training, but her presence inside the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force is extremely unusual; neither the CEDF nor the Imperial military is known for its transfer programs.

Analysis: Personable and bright Imperial military cadets don't end up embedded with aliens at the far edge of the galaxy without good reason. Temple could be a plant, but it's just as likely she's been intentionally forced out of the picture. Best-guess personality profile suggests she's a typically patriotic example of the rank-and-file Imperial military--a true believer in Imperial superiority and duty. No matter how easygoing or empathetic she may be at times, the needs of her nation have to come first.

Note by SIS Agent Hunter: She's cute, isn't she? Enjoy the file, Cipher Nine... we can spare the occasional dossier if you're willing to play along.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390732" version="1065353216">Raised by a colony of pacifist Chagrians, Rusk rebelled against his family's beliefs and enlisted with the Republic military as soon as he could. At first, he proved to be a brilliant soldier and was identified as a rising star in the Republic's ranks. Somewhere along the way, however, his bravery crossed the line into recklessness.

Although he still accomplished his missions, casualty rates among his squad rose astronomically. Rusk quickly became a pariah among other soldiers, including his superiors. His aggressive pursuit of victory over the Empire at any cost has earned him many medals from politicians, but no promotions from his commanders.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390733" version="1065353216">Among her peers, Jedi Leeha Narezz is considered something of an eccentric. She frequently eschews time with fellow Jedi to meditate with and instruct a trio of droids she built called the &quot;Meedees.&quot; Leeha believes that the Force is not accessible only to living creatures--indeed, she asserts that even droids can use it if they go long enough without a memory-wipe.

Despite her unusual beliefs, no one in the order disputes that Leeha is one of the finest technologists in the Republic. Repeated attempts by the military to direct her talents toward engines of war have failed, however. She remains firmly committed to peaceful applications of technology that warm the homeless, feed the hungry and protect the weak.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390735" version="1065353216">A failed Jedi Padawan who abandoned his training, the enthusiastically greedy Guss Tuno prefers the underworld lifestyle's potential for material riches. In a perfect galaxy, Guss would spend his retirement lounging in a heated swimming pool surrounded by exotic beauties while consuming a steady diet of fresh fish and expensive cocktails.

Although he often speaks before he thinks, Guss has talked his way out of certain death many times. He often uses his minimal knowledge of Jedi--and the lightsaber he stole from his old Master--to fool gullible criminals into leaving him alone. When that fails, Guss reveals he's a much better shot than anyone would believe.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390736" version="1065353216">The White Maw pirate Shai Tenna is rightfully regarded as one of the most brutally efficient killers in the underworld. He secured his control over a massive pirate crew by systematically murdering his own brothers. It is often remarked that by the time you see Shai Tenna's blaster, you're already dead.

Some say Shai Tenna was born bad. Others point to the harsh upbringing he and his brothers experienced at their cruel father's hands. A few with more intimate knowledge of the man might sigh with regret over the death of a good woman who tried to redeem him. Regardless, Shai Tenna has surrendered to his darker impulses without remorse.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="390739" version="1065353216">Captain Valon (Consular)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390739" version="1065353216">When Captain Valon launched his initial raids against the Rift Alliance's shipping lanes, no one had any idea who he was. Initially just a grunt in the ranks of the White Maw, Valon was indistinguishable from the other pirates who flocked to Hoth in search of easy pickings. His sudden rise and his gathering of so many followers is a mystery to the Rift Alliance's tacticians.

Not surprisingly, many wild stories have since sprung up about Captain Valon--most notably the claim that he is invulnerable. Captain Valon has certainly survived several attempts on his life, including onslaughts from the Rift Alliance coalition forces and failed coups from overambitious lieutenants, but this only proves that Valon is an adversary who must not be underestimated.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390744" version="1065353216">Even in an organization as diverse as the Republic Army, Yuun stands out. A member of the Gand species and hailing from the Gand homeworld, Yuun is a Findsman, a type of shamanistic tracker held in very high regard among his people. He applies his unusual training to technical tasks of every kind, resulting in a success record unmatched by any other technician in the military.

As effective as Yuun's methods are, they rarely meet with understanding or approval from his fellow soldiers. But despite his eccentricities, Yuun's fighting skill and calm approach to any challenge generally earn at least the grudging respect of the men and women he serves with.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390748" version="1065353216">Built for cold weather, the blue-furred, long-nosed Ortolans are deeply private individuals who--thanks to their large ears and keen olfactory senses--possess a deep appreciation for music and food. They can be found in small numbers throughout the galaxy, filling all walks of life, but they are best known as musicians and chefs.

Although not expansionist by nature, Ortolans have occasionally attempted to found full-fledged colonies away from their icy homeworld of Orto. One such group arrived on Hoth several years back. The Hoth Ortolans keep mostly to themselves, but the increasing presence of Republic, Empire and pirate forces on their adopted world has made them wary. Despite a kinship with the Republic, they value independence and--more importantly--peace. The current situation on Hoth threatens both.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="390753" version="1065353216">The Chiss are a proud and highly intelligent species, valuing a knack for strategy and subterfuge over brute force. Although isolated in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy within their so-called &quot;Chiss Ascendency,&quot; the Chiss were singled out by the Empire as potential servants and allies because of their outsider status and their relative lack of moral qualms.

It is not that Chiss are by nature evil, but that they value pragmatism and efficiency and recognize both those qualities reflected in the Empire. While as a nonhuman, non-Sith species, Chiss are regarded as second-class citizens within the Empire, the Chiss Ascendancy is permitted self-governance and supporters of a more diverse Empire often use the Chiss as an example of what the Empire can accomplish by welcoming other species. A few rare Chiss have even achieved official rank in the Imperial military and Imperial Intelligence.</text>

His file shows participation in several notable battles, including the so-called Eight-Hour Invasion of Dubrillion where Republic forces repelled an Imperial invasion force with minimal reinforcements. Since then, Lieutenant Iresso has earned excellent technical scores and commendations for exemplary service.

However, his file also contains some discrepancies. Lieutenant Iresso has one of the highest transfer rates in the Republic military, serving under almost a dozen commanders across the galaxy in two years. The lieutenant has also been overlooked for promotion several times. The only explanation from his superiors is a reference to an incident on Althir where Lieutenant Iresso was captured by the Empire, but no details are given.

The Brotherhood of the Sith was ready to strike. The fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma, the Sith sorceress Aleema and Mandalore gathered their armies to attack Coruscant. But they underestimated Coruscant's Jedi defenders. The Brotherhood's forces were repelled, and Ulic was captured.

Ulic was taken to the Senate tower to stand trial. But the Jedi Master Vodo Siosk-Baas sensed that Ulic hadn't acted alone, that Siosk-Baas's old student, Exar Kun, was involved. During the trial, Exar Kun himself marched into the Senate tower with his Massassi warriors. He subdued the assembly with his Force abilities and humiliated the Supreme Chancellor.

Vodo Siosk-Baas then entered, challenging his former pupil. Exar Kun's unusual double-bladed lightsaber and dark powers prevailed, however, and Siosk-Baas was killed. Exar Kun and Ulic then left Coruscant and returned to Yavin Four to prepare for the next battle.</text>

Treachery is the way of the Sith. Ulic Qel-Droma's capture on Coruscant had been engineered partly by his ally, the Sith sorceress Aleema Keto: she had ordered Mandalore to withdraw their forces at a critical moment. However, after Mandalore helped to rescue Ulic from Coruscant, he secretly told Ulic everything. Aleema's fate was sealed.

Feigning ignorance, Ulic continued with the Sith Brotherhood's plans. Using Naga Sadow's ancient battleship, the Corsair, they planned to lure the Republic fleet into the Cron Cluster and use the Corsair to destroy its suns, annihilating the fleet.

Aleema took the Corsair into the Cron Cluster and activated the superweapon, but Ulic had deliberately not warned her of the consequences. The blast annihilated the entire Cron Cluster in a supernova, sending a shockwave toward the Jedi world of Ossus. The Corsair itself was consumed, taking Aleema with it.</text>

The Brotherhood of the Sith had annihilated the Cron Cluster in a supernova, sending a massive shockwave towards the planet Ossus. Home to the Jedi for countless generations, Ossus safeguarded vast libraries and storehouses of artifacts.

As the Jedi scrambled to save their treasures from the coming cataclysm, the Sith Brotherhood leaders Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma arrived to raid the planet. Exar Kun managed to claim a number of notable Jedi artifacts. Meanwhile, Ulic fought against the Republic and Jedi forces only to be challenged by his own brother, Cay. 

The two brothers fought until Ulic finally struck Cay down. The shock of his brother's death left Ulic stunned with horror. The Jedi Nomi, who had once loved Ulic, was overcome with grief and used her tremendous powers to somehow sever Ulic's connection to the Force. Left powerless, Ulic wept at what he had become.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396413" version="1065353216">The source of the Three Families' wealth is their adrenal synthesis factories, which convert the Republic's processed Quesh venom into precious adrenals. The length of the process depends on the quality of the adrenals required; military grade adrenals take a week or so to produce, while cheaper ones can be created in days.

The Three Families guard the secret of adrenal creation very closely, meaning access to the factories is strictly regulated. All Republic personnel working there have to be carefully vetted and vouched for, and are subject to search without warning by Three Families enforcers. To keep its partnership with the Three Families harmonious, the Republic employs harsh punishments for theft; it is not uncommon for thieves of a single adrenal canister to be jailed and fined the cost of an entire vat.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396416" version="1065353216">Imperial Garrison</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396416" version="1065353216">When the Empire arrived on Quesh, its tacticians believed one swift strike would devastate the sparsely populated world. Instead, the Imperial forces managed to capture only a few mines and one processing station before they found themselves pushed back by the Republic. The captured processing station and its warehouses were soon converted into a garrison which remains the Empire's base of operations on Quesh today.

The headquarters of Moff Dracen and his commanders was once a storage warehouse for the processing station's chemicals. It has been thoroughly cleaned and furnished to the standards demanded by Imperial officers, though the lingering smell has never been fully removed.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396420" version="1065353216">Three Families Palace</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396420" version="1065353216">Freed from the Hutt Cartel's watchful eye, the Three Families have grown immensely wealthy on Quesh--and as their influence grows, the Three Families have begun solidifying their power base. A large portion of their profits from the adrenal refineries was spent building a lavish palace, complete with all modern conveniences and an impressive security network. Much more than a simple defensive position or status symbol, the Three Families Palace is intended to be a clear statement that the Three Families are wholly committed to defending Quesh.

The Palace has generally been kept off-limits to Republic personnel, especially the local military officials. This is partly for security reasons, as the Three Families keep their sensitive files close at hand. Portho the Hutt's indulgence in adrenals has also become something of an embarrassment in recent years. After several inappropriate comments from Portho to the Republic commanders, the Three Families prefer to simply keep him out of sight.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396421" version="1065353216">The Yuna Bore mine was once known for two strange treasures: Quesh venom and bones. The first miners found a fossil bed containing remains of Quesh's prehistoric creatures, preserved by rising silt and venom deposits after the big Quake. Since the Republic was only interested in the Quesh venom, the miners were free to recover the bones, ship them offworld and sell them to collectors and paleontologists on Coruscant. 

This turned out to be immensely profitable. Many miners were able to buy out their contracts on profits from the fossils alone. Even today, with the fossil bed cleared, the Yuna Bore remains productive, as the miners' attempts to discover more bones have driven the tunnels on well ahead of schedule.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396422" version="1065353216">Broga's Palace</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396422" version="1065353216">As head of the Three Families, Broga the Hutt considered it his right to have his own private home and base of operations separate from the Three Families Palace. Stocked with well-trained slaves and imported luxuries from Nar Shaddaa, Broga's Palace gradually became a power center in its own right, which made the Empire's siege and capture of the palace all the more humiliating.

Now held by the Imperial Moff Dracen, the defenses and strategic position of Broga's Palace have been turned against the Republic. With the Republic military focused on defending Quesh's miners and the Three Families protecting their mines, Broga has discussed hiring offworld mercenaries to retake his home... or to at least to reclaim his beloved wine cellar from Imperial hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396423" version="1065353216">Chem-Basin Mine</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396423" version="1065353216">The Chem-Basin Mine has only been open for four years, but it has already earned a reputation for accidents and mismanagement. The original survey team was almost suffocated when the members accidentally released a pocket of evaporated Quesh venom, and substandard materials meant the initial tunnels had to be re-propped and re-dug after a major collapse. Ever since, problems have dogged the site and slowed venom production.

Strangely, the miners who work at Chem-Basin exhibit a degree of pride in their mine. They claim any fool can work at the Grancha Lakand site and get results, but Chem-Basin calls for a degree of finesse that is scarce on Quesh. The subject is guaranteed to come up whenever Grancha Lakand and Chem-Basin miners are drinking together.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396424" version="1065353216">Quesh Venom Refinery</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396424" version="1065353216">As the Republic's main source of processed Quesh venom, the Quesh Venom Refinery is one of the most secure locations on the planet. Cut by droids from a ravine created by the Quake thousands of years ago, the stone quarried was used to build the high walls around the refinery. The main courtyard is under constant guard, and access is restricted to dignitaries and scientific experts.

This refinery is actually the second that the Republic built on Quesh. The first was destroyed when contaminants polluted the refining process, causing the processed Quesh venom to eat through the vats and then the lower refinery floor. The high walls around the current refinery are not only for defensive purposes, but to contain any future accidents or acts of sabotage.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396425" version="1065353216">Grancha Lakand Venom Mine</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396425" version="1065353216">Grancha Lakand is the largest and oldest venom mine on Quesh. Built through a fissure created by the Quake, the mine is named for its first explorer, who was trapped by a rockfall during his initial survey. By the time he was rescued, Grancha Lakand's adrenal countermeasures had worn off and he had been breathing Quesh venom fumes for some time. 

Lakand excitedly told his rescuers that he had had an epiphany while trapped. The biggest supply of Quesh venom on the planet lay beneath the fissure somewhere, and Lakand knew exactly where to find it. He was dismissed as a venom-intoxicated madman, but when Lakand recovered, he returned to the fissure and, after weeks of surveying, located a huge reservoir of Quesh venom. While not necessarily the largest on the planet, the reservoir has supplied the Grancha Lakand mine for several years without the venom running dry.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396427" version="1065353216">Quesh Imperial Outpost</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396427" version="1065353216">Originally intended to be the Empire's base of venom research on Quesh, a variety of setbacks and concerted attacks by the Republic hampered the Empire's scientific studies at this outpost. Hutt Cartel forces have since been stationed here at the Empire's request, guarding the scientists and using the outpost as a staging point and repair center for their battle droids. 

Although the Empire's research is now considered safe from the Republic, the strong cartel presence has made some of the Imperial scientists uneasy. The cartel has repeatedly offered to help the Empire with its study of Quesh venom, but Imperial commanders are concerned that the outpost half-belongs to the cartel already.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396428" version="1065353216">Republic Operational Headquarters</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396428" version="1065353216">The Republic's center of operations on Quesh was established roughly ten years ago. Initially housing civilian miners, medical professionals and scientists, these workers gradually moved on to smaller camps elsewhere. When the Empire attacked Quesh, the old miners' quarters were quickly converted into a barracks and the entire site was turned over to the Republic military.

Many newly arrived soldiers remark upon the Operational Headquarters' light defenses, especially considering the high-level personnel stationed there. In fact, the headquarters' best protection is the large Quesh venom pipelines nearby. In a dire emergency, the pipelines can be vented, causing a massive biohazard to slow any aggressors while personnel are evacuated.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396429" version="1065353216">Three Families War Camp</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396429" version="1065353216">When the Empire attacked Quesh, the Three Families initially coordinated the defense from their palace, but quickly realized they needed a more efficient operational post. They poured money into establishing a defensive point between their headquarters and the Republic base, and in a matter of days, the war camp was set up, supplied and staffed--an object lesson in how Hutts react when their credits are at stake.

Broga, the head of the Three Families, spends much of his time at the war camp since his private palace was captured by the Empire. His role is twofold: firstly, overseeing his forces as they coordinate with the Republic military, and secondly, ensuring that Republic forces are not passing on any of the Three Families' secrets concerning the handling of Quesh venom.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396451" version="1065353216">Atmosphere of Quesh</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396451" version="1065353216">Quesh venom is one of the most toxic substances in the galaxy. When the great Quake split the ground millennia ago and released the venom from beneath Quesh's surface, the venom's evaporation destroyed the planet's once-pleasant air and made the atmosphere more hazardous to breathe than some biowarfare chemicals. The native fauna quickly died off, leaving only bones behind.

Although the toxicity has faded over the years, it is unsafe to wander Quesh without powerful adrenal countermeasures, special implants or a breath mask. The only beings who can comfortably endure Quesh's atmosphere are Hutts, who claim not to understand what the fuss is about.

Quesh's miners have also discovered that the harsh atmosphere takes a toll on their equipment, causing droids to rust and tools to degrade more quickly. Fortunately, the vast profits gained from mining Quesh venom make up for the exorbitant running costs.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396453" version="1065353216">Discovering Quesh Venom</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396453" version="1065353216">Like many great scientific advances, Quesh venom's immense value was discovered by chance. After its initial discovery, the planet Quesh was dismissed as a toxic wasteland. Orbital chemical scans languished in a file for decades until they were unearthed by a junior Republic chemist named Bardian Aelto. After working briefly on adrenal research projects, Aelto had been assigned to review planets likely to be classified as uninhabitable.

When Aelto studied Quesh's chemical scans, he was surprised to recognize a molecule chain from his work on adrenal stimulants. Quesh's atmosphere had properties almost identical to &quot;Hutt venom&quot;, the primary ingredient in the galaxy's most high-grade adrenals. Aelto realized a relatively simple chemical process could convert this &quot;Quesh venom&quot; into a usable--and exceptionally valuable--compound. Thanks to one late-night session in a Coruscant laboratory, Quesh had become one of the Republic's most valued resource worlds.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396460" version="1065353216">Hutt Neutrality</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396460" version="1065353216">With their vast fortunes, access to mercenary armies and ownership of resource-rich worlds, support from individual Hutts--or the Hutt Cartel itself--can mean the difference between victory and defeat in a galactic conflict. But Hutts are businessmen at heart. Why tie yourself to one side of a quarrel when you can remain aloof and profit from both? Thanks to their long lifespan, Hutts who choose sides also risk embroiling themselves in centuries-old grudges.

The Hutt Cartel is officially neutral in the galactic struggle, and it attempts to redress any egregious offenses committed by its members. Pragmatism and personal inconvenience aside, however, the Hutts have no vested interest in seeing either the Republic or the Empire permanently gain the upper hand. In peace, both sides would seek to regulate the Hutts; while the two factions are at odds, the Hutts can be assured of both autonomy and a steady, comfortable income.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396464" version="1065353216">Military Adrenals</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396464" version="1065353216">Most commanders prefer to rely on rigorous training and good equipment to succeed, but no advantage can be ignored when soldiers' lives are at stake. Since the Great War, the use of military adrenals--safe, nonaddictive stimulants that improve a soldier's endurance, stamina or reflexes--has become more common. A good stock of adrenals can keep a company fresh and on its feet during a forced march, or save wounded individuals from succumbing to their injuries before help arrives.

Naturally, military adrenal stocks are carefully regulated and, if possible, reserved only for emergencies. It is possible for soldiers to rely on adrenals too much and overstress themselves. Theft and sale of military adrenals, which are of the highest quality, has also become a thriving cornerstone of the galactic black market, especially on worlds like Ord Mantell.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396465" version="1065353216">Quesh Venom</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396465" version="1065353216">Quesh's sole natural resource is a substance properly known as venenit queshaaga. Nicknamed &quot;venom,&quot; the liquid form of the substance can--when properly refined and processed--create extremely potent military-grade adrenals that safely increase a soldier's combat abilities for a limited time. With galactic tensions rising, Quesh venom has become one of the most valuable substances in the universe and a key to military victory for both the Republic and the Empire.

Unprocessed, Quesh venom is a virulent toxin. In its purest form, it is found seeping out of fissures created millennia ago by an ancient quake; it is these fissures that are mined by Republic and Imperial work crews. Over the centuries, significant amounts of Quesh venom have evaporated and tainted the planet's atmosphere, rendering the entire world poisonous to most forms of life.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396466" version="1065353216">The Quake</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396466" version="1065353216">Quesh's rugged landscape is a result of the Quake, a massive geological event that occurred some fifty thousand years ago. Technically a series of groundquakes that lasted for three hundred years, the Quake caused Quesh's continents to move several meters apart, creating massive fissures in the ground. This in turn allowed the poisonous Quesh venom to rise up from the depths of Quesh and seep to the surface, leaving the atmosphere toxic to this day.

Quesh has been geologically stable for thousands of years now, but this has not stopped the Three Families from investing heavily in early warning systems; tremors one one-hundredth the size of the Quake could wipe out their refineries. Republic geologists have considered exploring the deepest caves exposed by the Quake, but until the caves are mined clear of Quesh venom, they are far too toxic to enter.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="396467" version="1065353216">The Three Families</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396467" version="1065353216">When the Republic began mining Quesh venom, its scientists soon realized that, while they could refine the venom into a non-toxic compound, converting it into usable adrenals was much more problematic. After many expensive failures, the Republic appealed to the Hutt Cartel for expert help and was refused.

But three Hutt families, salivating at the potential profits--led by the Hutts Broga, Jeelta and Portho--broke from the cartel and offered their services. Although this was technically a breach of the Hutt Cartel's carefully established neutral position in the galaxy, generous kickbacks to the cartel kept its members looking the other way. 

Today, the Three Families run Quesh's refineries and processing plants while the Republic controls the mines. This arrangement allows the Three Families to carefully guard the secret of adrenal creation, and it has made them incredibly wealthy. However, the Families' split from the Hutt Cartel also means the Empire can target them without fear of reprisal.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="396473" version="1065353216">A veteran of battles on Dantooine and Velmor, General Korvan has years of experience defending resource-rich planets. Not only an experienced commander, he is also an accomplished diplomat used to balancing the requirements of the military with the demands of greedy corporations and the needs of workers. His unflappable nature made him the Republic's first choice to handle the crisis on Quesh.

General Korvan's polished manners occasionally clash with his quick-tempered strategist, Major Treeg, who believes that with the right battle plan, the Republic could wipe the Imperial forces off Quesh in a day. Korvan has adopted a more patient approach to the Empire's invasion, however, well aware that protecting Quesh's mines and workers must take precedence over a full scale assault.</text>

Although confident of an eventual Imperial victory, he has been careful to win over elements within the Three Families and recruit Republic defectors, knowing the Empire's foothold on Quesh is not yet cemented. 

His most notable achievement on Quesh is the capture of Broga the Hutt's palace, a key defensive position he has since adopted as his fallback headquarters and private residence--after some refurnishing. It is Moff Dracen's private hope that a victory on Quesh will not only begin the Republic's inevitable fall, but perhaps see him installed as governor of one of the galaxy's most profitable worlds.</text>

The Mandalorians had never forgotten their humiliating defeat at the Republic's hands during the Great Sith War. With his Neo-Crusader warriors prepared by a decade of conquest, Mandalore the Ultimate decided the time was right and launched an assault on the Republic. Several Zabrak colonies fell to the Mandalorian advance, under heavy blaster fire and the shadow of Basilisk war droids.

Finally provoked into action, the Republic appealed to the Jedi for military support, but the Council refused. The Masters believed there were greater forces at work behind the Mandalorian invasion than a simple lust for war. They wanted to remain apart from the conflict, believing the true threat would reveal itself in time. However, some younger Jedi disagreed with the Council's edict. These Jedi would form a splinter group, the &quot;Revanchists,&quot; and answer the Republic's call for help.</text>

The Mandalorians had returned to take revenge on the Republic and sate their lust for war and conquest. With the Jedi Council refusing to lend military aid--believing the true threat was still unclear, and the risk of conflict-hardened Jedi falling to the darkness was high--the Republic was unable to prevent the Mandalorians from devastating the planet Cathar. Millions died. This was the last straw for several young Jedi, who disobeyed the Council to join the war effort. 

The most notable was Revan, a charismatic and skilled leader who rose to the rank of general. Revan's friend Alek, later known as Malak, distinguished himself on the front lines. Revan's tactics and Malak's unyielding strength turned the tide, helping the Republic forces to victory at Althir and Jaga's Cluster. 

But the Council did not approve. Seeing their rash involvement in the war and their gradual adoption of Mandalorian tactics, the Council watched Revan and Malak's heroics uneasily, remembering the fall of Exar Kun.</text>

For years, the Jedi Covenant had existed secretly within the Jedi Order, dedicated to finding and destroying the next Sith threat before it began. Then, during a mission with their Padawans, the Covenant seers had a terrifying vision: a Sith Lord in red destroying the galaxy. The Covenant realized their Padawans were wearing red environmental suits, exactly like the Sith Lord in their vision.

The Jedi Covenant made a solemn decision. To ensure the galaxy's safety, their Padawans had to be killed before the prophecy was fulfilled. The terrible deed was done on Taris during the Padawans' knighting ceremony. 

Only the Padawan Zayne Carrick, who was late to the ceremony, survived. Framed for the murder of his fellow Padawans, Carrick went on the run, pursued by the Covenant who feared he would become the next Sith Lord.</text>

As the Mandalorian Wars raged, Zayne Carrick escaped the Jedi Covenant, falsely accused of murdering his fellow Padawans.

Morne was searching for the Muur Talisman, a Sith artifact that could turn humans into monstrous rakghouls.

Morne attempted to arrest Carrick but was interrupted by a Mandalorian raid. Realizing the Mandalorians had found the Muur Talisman, Morne and Carrick stowed away on the Mandalorians' ship to Jebble. The dark talisman possessed Morne, and she began using it to turn the Mandalorians into rakghouls. 

Horrified, Carrick finally persuaded Morne to see reason. She agreed to be sealed away in an oubliette to protect the galaxy from the talisman's corruptive power. The oubliette was lost when the Mandalorians razed Jebble; however, Carrick spoke of the Muur Talisman--and rakghouls--to another Jedi, Alek... later known as Darth Malak.</text>

The Jedi Covenant's attempts to prevent another Sith war had led its members to horrific acts, culminating in the murder of their Padawans. It was too much for the seer Xamar, who left the Covenant to aid Zayne Carrick, the Padawan framed for the crime.

Together they went to confront Krynda Draay, the founder of the Jedi Covenant, and her son Lucien, Carrick's former Master. At the Draay mansion, Carrick discovered the real culprit: Krynda's aide Haazen, a fallen Jedi who had been manipulating the Covenant. As Lucien and Carrick dueled, Haazen used an override in the Republic Navy's weapon systems, intending to destroy the Jedi Temple and the Council. 

At the last minute, Lucien overcame his anger, helped Carrick escape, then used Haazen's override to bombard Haazen's position instead. Haazen was killed; Lucien survived, suffering serious injuries. Zayne Carrick's name was cleared, and the Jedi Covenant was finished.</text>

Ignoring the Jedi Council's disapproval, the Jedi generals Revan and Malak had gone to war against the Mandalorians, gradually pushing the warriors back. After lengthy maneuvering, Revan chose the planet Malachor Five as his final battleground. 

As Republic and Mandalorian ships clashed, Revan challenged Mandalore himself to single combat and defeated him, claiming the mask that was Mandalore's symbol of leadership. Meanwhile, one of Revan's generals enacted Revan's fearful plan, activating a superweapon called the Mass Shadow Generator.

The Mass Shadow Generator destroyed not only the Mandalorian fleet, but most of the Republic ships and much of the planet Malachor Five. The Republic suffered horrific losses, but Revan, hardened by years of war, saw it as a necessary price for victory. Leaderless, the remnants of the Mandalorian fleet fled into the Unknown Regions, with Revan and Malak in pursuit.</text>

Finally, the Mandalorians had been routed. The Jedi generals Revan and Malak had killed Mandalore and hounded the remnants of the enemy fleet far beyond the boundaries of Republic space--and in so doing, performed terrible deeds and learned dark powers.

But there were darker days to come. During Revan's pursuit of the Mandalorians, he and Malak discovered the ancient Sith Empire hidden on Dromund Kaas. Realizing this Empire was the true threat to the Republic, Revan and Malak faced the Sith Emperor himself, intending to cut off the serpent's head--but the Emperor was too powerful. Overwhelmed by the Emperor's dark presence, they pledged themselves to his service.

The Sith Emperor anointed Revan and Malak as true Sith Lords and sent them to seek out the Star Forge, an ancient alien space station capable of producing powerful starships and droids. Never revealing the existence of the Emperor, Revan and Malak then returned to the armies that had followed them against the Mandalorians, armed their loyal servants with the Star Forge's weapons, and marched to war against the Republic.</text>

Revan and Malak, once great Jedi, had turned to the dark side and sought to conquer the Republic. With an infinite fleet produced by the Star Forge space station, they seemed as unstoppable as the Mandalorians. They took control of entire systems and established a new Sith academy on Korriban.

This time, the Jedi Council did not hesitate to act. The Republic lured the Sith Lords into battle against a small fleet. This allowed a Jedi strike team led by Bastila Shan to board Darth Revan's flagship. 

Darth Malak had plans of his own. Having grudgingly taken his role as Revan's apprentice, he decided to usurp his master. With the Jedi providing a perfect distraction, Malak fired on Revan's flagship, destroying the bridge. Malak claimed the title of Dark Lord, not realizing the Jedi strike team had survived and taken Revan--injured, but alive--as their prisoner.</text>

Throughout Jedi history, the order has always refused to execute prisoners. When the wounded Darth Revan--the fallen Jedi responsible for countless deaths and acts of war--was captured, the Jedi Council saw an opportunity to stop Revan's successor, Darth Malak.

Using the Force, the Jedi reprogrammed Revan's mind with a new identity--that of an ordinary Republic citizen. Alongside Bastila Shan, a Jedi gifted in Battle Meditation, Revan began seeking out Rakata star maps, unwittingly retracing the path to the Star Forge battle station that served as Darth Malak's secret weapon.

Along the way, Revan retrained as a Jedi and learned of his terrible past. Aboard the Star Forge, he saved the life of Bastila Shan and faced Darth Malak in battle. Finally, Revan struck Malak down, ending a galactic threat and the Jedi Civil War.</text>

Finally, Revan made a decision. After leaving behind instructions with allies like Bastila Shan and Carth Onasi, Revan left for the Unknown Regions hoping to put an end to the Sith Empire. He was never seen again.</text>

In the chaos after the Jedi Civil War, new Sith began to rise up, inspired by the likes of Exar Kun and Darth Revan and unaware of the Sith Empire still hidden on Dromund Kaas. Three lords stood above all others: Darth Nihilus, whose hunger devoured all life around him; Darth Sion, whose shattered body was held together by hatred; and Darth Traya, once a Jedi Master but now the Lord of Betrayal. These Sith Lords ruled from ancient Sith ruins on Malachor Five. 

Darth Traya was the most senior of the three, but when Sion and Nihilus united against her, she fled Malachor Five and took the name Kreia. Darth Sion created an elite cadre of Sith assassins, eroding the already-weakened Jedi from the shadows, while Darth Nihilus began roaming the galaxy, seeking the life energy of Force users to satisfy his insatiable hunger.

The order's Masters, including the legendary Vandar Tokare, gathered to discuss the possibility that the Sith had returned. They did not know that Darth Nihilus, a being of pure hunger and dark side power, was approaching the colony.

Drawn to the assembled Masters, Nihilus devoured the life energy of everything on Katarr. Millions of Miraluka died, along with most of the Jedi Order's senior members. Walking Katarr's lifeless surface later, Darth Nihilus came across the only survivor: the traumatized Miraluka Visas Marr, whom Nihilus took as his apprentice.</text>

Having lost all ability to feel the Force, the Exile accepted the Council's sentence of banishment and left to wander the Outer Rim. When she returned years later, the Jedi had all but vanished--slain by mysterious Sith assassins or driven into hiding.

Simply by returning, the Exile became a target for these Sith and was hounded to the remote Peragus system. After meeting a mysterious Force-sensitive named Kreia at Peragus, the Exile began searching for any surviving Jedi Masters to discover what they knew.</text>

As the Exile recovered from this encounter, Kreia deliberately enticed the terrible Darth Nihilus to the planet Telos Four. Nihilus prepared to devour all life on the planet, and Nihilus's dreadnought, the Ravager, was met by the Republic Navy and Mandalorian forces.

Finally, the Exile dueled Darth Traya--who claimed that, despite her betrayal, there was no ill-will between them. To Traya, the Exile represented freedom from the Force, which Traya had come to despise. With Traya's death, the Exile left Malachor Five for the last time, and the Sith Triumvirate was defeated.</text>

But the Jedi Exile and the other heroes of the Jedi Civil War would not see the Republic fall. 

With renewed treaties and alliances, trade gradually began to flow and the Republic military regained its strength. Meanwhile, the Exile trained new Jedi recruits, forming a council of her companions who achieved mastery and welcoming others who came out of hiding. After years of slow but steady growth, the reborn Jedi Order made a triumphant return to its long-abandoned temple on Coruscant.

The conflict between these two factors caused at least one G0-T0 droid to break its programming and go rogue, choosing to strengthen the Republic by any means necessary.

At first the Dark Council was subservient to the Emperor. But as centuries passed and the Emperor remained withdrawn, the Dark Council became more independent, believing he was weakening. When the council discovered the Emperor was planning to invade the Republic, there was angry dissent.

When strange battle cruisers were reported in the Tingel Arm, the Republic sent a diplomatic vessel that was annihilated after sending a frantic transmission. As the Republic and Jedi began to investigate these mysterious newcomers, a massive Imperial battle fleet descended on Korriban, triumphantly reclaiming the Sith holy world for the Empire.

Imperial fleets converged on targets in the Outer Rim, devastating key military outposts. Planetary governments corrupted by secret Imperial agents suddenly revealed their allegiance to the Sith. No one knew how powerful this reborn Sith Empire was, how large it had grown during the past millennium or where its capital was located.

The Republic was thrown into chaos. Disagreements in the Senate and the defection of key systems delayed its military response, while the Imperial forces coolly carried out the Emperor's plans. Despite several important victories--most notably at Bothawui--the Republic was forced onto a defensive footing. The first stage of the Emperor's plan was a success.</text>

The cell blocks in the High Security Section are designed to hold small communities of nonhuman prisoners with similar cultural or physiological needs. Although many species can and do survive among near-humans, official policy states that prisoners kept in species-tailored conditions (with select food, atmospheric mixtures, and so on) are often more tranquil.

The High Security Section has a dark reputation among Belsavis's inmates. Prisoners sent to the medical centers often don't return, the rumors say, and the Republic's scientists experiment with dangerous technologies drawn from Belsavis's ancient vaults.

Prisoners who require specialized holding facilities are shipped to higher-security areas, but here, inmates are permitted to gather and to work, albeit under strict supervision.

When the Empire inserted its forces onto the planet, it converted the remains of a camp used by early Republic explorers into a fortified lodgment. From there, Imperial forces have made surgical strikes to breach cell blocks and obliterate dividing walls. The Republic has since pulled many of the Belsavis guards and their families to relative safety in the prison's security and administrative centers.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455754" version="1065353216">Thousands of years before the Republic conceived of the notion, a species known as the Rakata turned Belsavis into a prison planet. From what little scientists have learned by studying ancient writings and from the decaying memory banks of Rakata warden droids, Belsavis was built to hold monsters, warlords and so-called &quot;lords of the infinite&quot;--anything the primeval and incredibly powerful Rakata feared.

The Belsavis prison administration calls the Rakata section of Belsavis &quot;the Tomb.&quot; Here, prisoners are held in eternal stasis, frozen in place and denied movement and thought by ancient technologies. Not all the inmates are ancient, however--many were given by the Republic to the warden droids for safekeeping, when no other cell could hold them.

Through the use of droids, remote-controlled probes and rare exploratory teams, the Republic has set up a series of monitoring and communication stations throughout the Tomb. Despite this, only a tiny portion of the Tomb has been explored; this is the domain of the ancients.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455758" version="1065353216">Belsavis Automated Security</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455758" version="1065353216">Belsavis's automated security systems consist of a complex web of logic programs, identity databases, mechanical interfaces and emergency overrides. Computers control everything from coma gas ventilation to laser turrets to holocameras to energy field lockdowns, along with far more obscure technologies.

What makes Belsavis's security unusual is its distributed nature. Different sections of the prison and different types of responses are controlled by entirely separate computer systems. This ensures that damage or corruption to one system cannot compromise the entire prison, but it also makes untangling errors difficult at best.

Some of Belsavis's security systems are even tied into rumored alien technology in the deep levels of the prison; this allows them to access systems of unusual power, but also causes occasional eccentricities when outside protocols override modern programming. Usually, these eccentricities are harmless--a computer displays its interface in an unknown language, or indoor humidity rises uncomfortably--but the prison technicians fear that far worse is possible.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455761" version="1065353216">Belsavis Prison Break</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455761" version="1065353216">The Empire's attack on Belsavis came as a complete surprise. So far as the Republic knew, the prison's location was an absolute secret--and even if the secret were exposed, the planet seemed unlikely to become a top-priority military target. In this, the strategists were mistaken.

The Empire began its attack by delivering a small team of Sith and elite soldiers onto the planet surface. Their first task was to free as many prisoners as possible and throw the prison into chaos. Some of the prisoners (including long-lost Imperial prisoners-of-war) allied with the Empire, while others joined the riots and attacked all parties. As the Republic scrambled to respond, the Empire established a makeshift base of operations on the surface and brought a mobile battle platform into orbit.

The Empire's position on Belsavis is precarious, but until the Republic can alter its focus from the prisoners to the invaders, the situation is unlikely to change.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455762" version="1065353216">Belsavis Prison Personnel</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455762" version="1065353216">The personnel who run the Belsavis prison come from a variety of backgrounds. Many are Republic military, but others are decorated members of planetary security forces or staff transfers from maximum security prisons elsewhere. All receive extensive training upon acceptance into the Belsavis forces, and are experts at riot control, siege tactics and asymmetrical combat. Some are also skilled interrogators, negotiators and psychologists.

Augmenting the staff is a veritable army of Republic security droids, including many built and maintained on Belsavis. The Belsavis warden droids are designed specifically for prison work, and can move through parts of Belsavis where no living guard is permitted.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455764" version="1065353216">Belsavis Vaults</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455764" version="1065353216">Scattered across the surface of Belsavis are ancient structures built from an unknown material, practically impervious to weapons and scanners. Engraved on the walls and doors of these structures are strange warnings in ancient languages, imploring anyone who finds the structures to stay away and not unseal their contents.

Republic science teams have opened a handful of these alien vaults, finding others broken open before their arrival. The vaults' contents are classified even to most prison personnel, but rumors suggest that they contain ancient weapons, machines and even living creatures--some perfectly preserved, others ruined. After several science teams were lost, further exploration was halted. Protection of the sealed vaults is one of the administration's top priorities.

A few vaults--seemingly empty and opened long ago--have been converted for use by the Republic as additional holding facilities or secure storage. In addition, stories persist among both the inmates and the low-level prison staff of much larger vaults of similar design in the prison's Maximum Security Section.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455766" version="1065353216">Esh-Kha Culture</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455766" version="1065353216">To outsiders, the Esh-kha appear to be a savage and violent people, caring only about the destruction of all other species. In fact, the Esh-kha closely resemble a hive society. Although each individual has his own thoughts and aspirations, every Esh-kha is born in his place, bred for a role and eager to fulfill it. Their society is divided into castes: the Force-sensitive but simple-minded savants; the skilled, determined warriors, who are the most numerous and who watch over their savant brethren; and the patriarch, whose wisdom shapes the decisions of the Esh-kha as a whole. 

The Esh-kha's hatred for all other sentient species may stem from their tightly-knit society; Esh-kha are simply unable to tolerate or adapt to the existence of thinking beings who are not Esh-kha. But this savagery only extends to outsiders. Esh-kha are only violent with each other under the most extreme circumstances.

Esh-kha are not named at birth, but earn their names through action. An Esh-kha who proves particularly cunning might become &quot;Razor Mind&quot; or &quot;Water Thinker.&quot; This may partly explain the Esh-kha zeal in battle, as young warriors seek not only victory, but the opportunity to claim a name and forge their own identity.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455768" version="1065353216">History of Belsavis Prison</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455768" version="1065353216">Over twenty thousand years ago, the alien Rakata turned the jungle planet Belsavis into a prison. There, they entombed indescribable monsters, heretics and warlords, weapons to shatter stars, whole species... anything they feared or treasured above all reason. And when the Rakata's age of glory ended, the droids they left behind maintained the seals.

Many millennia later, after the rise of the Republic, Belsavis became known as an unremarkable planet in the middle of an ice age, populated by only a handful of primitives. It was only happenstance that caused Republic scouts to notice first the tropical rifts that defied the freezing temperatures, and then the strange vaults and the alien structures burrowing into the core of the planet.

Top-secret expeditions attempted to explore the alien vaults, until the extent of the dangers became apparent. At last, select Senators worked with the Strategic Information Service to construct Belsavis prison--a facility with two purposes. First, to guard, contain and study the terrible alien structures on the planet. And second, to create a prison for the Republic--one where the most powerful offenders could be placed within the Rakata's cells, and where lesser threats could be isolated on the most secure planet in the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455770" version="1065353216">Mind Trap</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455770" version="1065353216">The ancient Rakata built mind traps as the ultimate prison. These strange devices leave the victim's body intact, but draw the psyche into an otherworldly &quot;white room&quot;--a virtual environment created by the mind trap's power. While inside the white room, the victim does not hunger or age, and his thoughts are not impaired--but he can have no contact with the outside world until another being accesses the device. It is entirely possible for the victim's body to die and the victim's psyche to suffer immortality inside a white, featureless void. Certain technologies allow a mind trap's victims to holographically project into the real world, though whether the Rakata intended this is a mystery.

During the height of the Infinite Empire, entrapment was reserved as a punishment for Rakata only. At other periods, however, other dangerous beings have been placed within the devices.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455773" version="1065353216">Primeval Beasts</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455773" version="1065353216">The creatures imprisoned beneath Belsavis defy easy classification. Many resemble animals found elsewhere in the galaxy, but possess traits that make them far more dangerous than their &quot;ordinary&quot; counterparts. Republic scientists theorize many were enhanced through direct genetic alteration, but such techniques go far beyond current science.

Although most of the creatures in the prison have been kept in stasis through the centuries, a few sealed cell blocks hold surviving colonies that have bred over generations, feeding on supplies delivered by caretaker droids or on one another. Strangest of all, a handful of alien etchings refer to creatures living outside of stasis but without need of food or water, raging and awaiting their chance at escape.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455774" version="1065353216">Rakata Technology</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455774" version="1065353216">The ancient Rakata combined proficiency with the Force with a mastery of technology and bioengineering. Massive weapons of war--such as the Star Forge, a space station powered by the dark side and capable of manufacturing whole fleets--were among their largest-scale achievements, but not every Rakata creation was so grandiose.

Rakata mind traps are capable of containing the psyche of an individual in a virtual environment. Creatures bred and enhanced by Rakata life-shapers can survive both hard vacuum and baradium explosives. Rakata droids possess weaponry capable of breaking apart most forms of matter at the atomic level.

Rakata relics--even nonfunctional ones--are desperate sought after by those few scientists and archaeologists aware of their existence. Urban legends among smuggling rings tell of ancient devices that wreak havoc on their owners, and both Imperial Intelligence and the Strategic Information Service monitor these rumors with interest. One stray Rakata artifact can change the course of history.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455793" version="1065353216">The Domination Experiments</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455793" version="1065353216">Code-named &quot;Project Noble Focus,&quot; the domination experiments are one of the Republic's darkest and best-kept secrets. Instituted by Senator Tudos, the project's purpose is to analyze the military capabilities of countless alien species by pitting prisoners against each other in closely monitored combat scenarios. Aliens are divided into test groups, armed and equipped appropriate to their species, and forced to battle. Winners receive better supplies and better treatment--temporarily.

Although only a select few in the Republic's political and military echelons are aware of the project's existence, the project has come to involve several dozen personnel on Belsavis. Most of the prison staff members are unaware of the experiments, but authorized higher-ups along with the scientists and guards who maintain the project have, apparently, managed to silence their consciences.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455795" version="1065353216">The Infinite Empire</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455795" version="1065353216">Over twenty thousand years ago, the Rakata ruled an empire hundreds of worlds strong. They enslaved armies of lesser beings, but slavery and war were only incidental to the Rakata way of life. Their Infinite Empire was built on the promise that the Rakata could reshape existence to suit themselves--they would warp space, peer through time, create and destroy species at a whim. To humanoid minds, the Rakata of old were mad hedonists and philosophers without conscience.

For all their arrogance and their eventual fall (and they did fall, in time, when their power mysteriously faded and their slaves revolted en masse), the Rakata were supreme at their peak. They effortlessly merged their strength in the Force with technological genius, creating nightmarish and brilliant devices. Their achievements may never be matched; perhaps this is for the best.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455797" version="1065353216">The World Razer</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455797" version="1065353216">Almost nothing is known of the ancient being known as the World Razer. No one has seen or spoken to the creature for thousands of years; the Rakata's cryptic warnings suggest the World Razer is Belsavis's oldest prisoner, and that the prison was first constructed to hold the terrible entity whose hunger consumed a thousand worlds.

According to the Rakata inscriptions in the Tomb, it took the combined might of the Infinite Empire to subdue the World Razer, and an entire planet to contain its fury. If such a creature were ever released, its rage might very well shatter the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455800" version="1065353216">Belsavis Prisoners</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455800" version="1065353216">Prisoners are sentenced to Belsavis for two reasons: they are too dangerous or too difficult to imprison anywhere else. In the former category are some of the most treacherous beings in the galaxy--master assassins, hardened pirates, war criminals, slavers, Sith Lords and others. 

The second category is broader--Belsavis contains escape artists, slicers and shapechangers whose crimes are relatively minor compared to the destructive madmen who dwell alongside them. Gang leaders and syndicate leaders can fall into this category as well, placed in Belsavis to isolate them from their web of criminal contacts.

The prison administration attempts to separate prisoners of like affiliation--members of a single gang, for example, are often divided among multiple cell blocks--but prisoners not in isolation quickly form their own alliances inside Belsavis. Murder and assault are common inside the prison, and for many, protection comes in numbers.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455804" version="1065353216">New Men</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455804" version="1065353216">The New Men began as a cyberneticist cult on the planet Metellos, where its founder, Teha Zero, advocated the merger of man and machine. The cult foresaw an era where scarcity and physical limitations ceased to exist, and all people lived in peace.

Teha's apprentice Bezar One, who assumed leadership after Teha's death, took the cult in a new direction. The New Men began a series of violent raids to procure equipment, murdering anyone who interfered, and began plans for a city-wide &quot;electric ascension&quot; that would have empowered the cyborgs and cost of millions of lives.

The plot was thwarted, and Bezar One and his lieutenants were imprisoned on Belsavis. Since then, the New Men have recruited new members, improvising cybernetic implants by stealing droid parts and performing surgery in secret. Amazingly, relatively few of the New Men's recruits die during their initiation--for all their madness, the cultists know what they're doing.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455807" version="1065353216">The Dread Masters</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455807" version="1065353216">The Dread Masters are powerful Sith Lords who have served the Sith Emperor for centuries as prophets, generals and advisors. Their name was earned when they studied the power of the Phobis devices, artifacts that have driven even the most depraved Sith mad with terror. This power allowed the Dread Masters to destroy entire Republic fleets during the Great War, until they were captured and imprisoned on Belsavis.

The Dread Masters were known to spend years in secluded meditation on Dromund Kaas, emerging only to bring their wisdom to the Emperor or accept gifts from supplicants. Over the decades, they have become inseparable, their immense strength in the Force coming only from all six masters working in unison. Should the Empire ever succeed in freeing them from Belsavis, the galaxy will tremble before them again.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455809" version="1065353216">The Imperial Guard</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455809" version="1065353216">The ultimate non-Force sensitive fighters in the Empire serve the Emperor and the Emperor alone. Although most citizens know them as protectors of the Sith Academy on Korriban and the sanctum of the Citadel on Dromund Kaas, the guardsmen's mandate takes them wherever the Emperor requires. Even the Dark Council has neither control nor oversight of the guard's activities.

Clad in blood-red robes and armor, Imperial Guardsmen serve for life. Chosen for duty and initiated through deadly tests and traditions, those too old for active duty become instructors for the next generation until their skills deteriorate to the point where they are inevitably slain by a new recruit during training. 

Fanatic in loyalty and unmatched in martial skill, even a lone Imperial Guard is a formidable opponent capable of standing toe-to-toe with a Jedi... or a Sith, should the occasion arise.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455810" version="1065353216">Righteous and ideological, the Condemned is a gang of prison inmates united by a common past--unlike their fellow inmates, none of the Condemned have ever been convicted of a crime. Instead, the Condemned are all descended from criminals and dissidents imprisoned on Belsavis. The Republic, fearing exposure, refused to grant amnesty to any prison-born offspring, effectively passing the parents' life sentences on to their children.

These &quot;cell inheritors&quot; were divided and directionless until a young and charismatic Kaleesh named Nyranos united them. Nyranos, whose father was convicted of destroying a Republic embassy on Kashyyyk, grew disillusioned with his imposed imprisonment and petitioned Warden Playt for parole. When his petition was denied, Nyranos rallied his fellow Condemned as they swore to take their freedom by force.</text>

Whereas other Nikto see raw might as the key to dominance, the Circle sees technology as the only power in the galaxy to rival the Force, possessing the ability to transform lives, societies and cultures, and to determine the outcome of wars. Since the Belsavis prison break, the Circle members have applied their tireless ingenuity attempting to seize control of Belsavis's security systems and the strange technologies hidden in the deeper parts of the prison.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455817" version="1065353216">The Followers of the Hallow Voice (Consular)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455817" version="1065353216">In the years before their imprisonment by the Infinite Empire, the Esh-kha had wiped out countless species and expanded onto their conquered worlds. With so much living space, the Esh-kha population exploded. Eventually, a new patriarch was born while the old one was still healthy, something never seen before. This new patriarch, Hallow Voice, also had peculiar new ideas of how the Esh-kha should cooperate with other species.

The Esh-kha realized their group had grown too large and needed to split. Hallow Voice's birth and his unfamiliar ideas were clearly intended to divide their society and keep it from collapsing. As Esh-kha warriors were born who declared themselves for Hallow Voice, the young patriarch agreed to take his followers away from the main group. They settled on a distant world and began reaching out to nearby cultures. 

However, the Esh-kha had become known for violence and mass destruction. Only a few tentative alliances were achieved before the Infinite Empire imprisoned the Esh-kha on Belsavis. Still, Jedi historians now wonder if a particular legend of grey-skinned warriors told in the Outer Rim--once thought to concern the Taung--might be a faint memory of Hallow Voice's followers.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455819" version="1065353216">The Scourge (Smuggler)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455819" version="1065353216">The Scourge is the largest, best organized and most violent prison gang on Belsavis. Its members are suspected not only of the deaths of multiple prisoners, but also of several Republic guards. It is rumored the Scourge gang controls all illicit trade within the prison. Anyone who wishes to survive on Belsavis must submit to the Scourge's authority.

The gang's vicious leader is Jaardu Raax, a Rodian crime lord and mass murderer. Jaardu killed over three hundred innocent citizens when he set off thermal detonators on a busy Coruscant market street while trying to escape Republic law enforcement. He was given a life sentence on Belsavis, but that has not stopped his violent ways.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455820" version="1065353216">Dagger Wing was one of the most famous and celebrated Republic starfighter units of the Great War. Records of its missions were the stuff of legend, and all of its pilots were regarded as heroes. When High Command announced that Dagger Wing was missing in action, it was a harsh blow to morale.

Despite the hundreds of fellow soldiers who volunteered to brave enemy fire in search of the lost pilots, the Republic quietly closed the book on Dagger Wing. The truth was far more damaging than the lie that the heroes had been lost; Dagger Wing's war crime--the unauthorized bombing of thousands of Imperial civilians on Fest--would have destroyed Republic credibility and created a diplomatic crisis. Better to bury the truth, mourn and move on.

Dagger Wing would be imprisoned on Belsavis, and the subject would not be raised again.</text>

She and her network of killers were imprisoned on Belsavis after she was betrayed and handed over to the Jedi by one of her own--a Sith assassin who renounced the dark side and sought refuge among the Jedi.

Many believe Darth Ekkage was as powerful a weapon as the Sith have ever had, and that their victory over the Republic would have been completed long ago if Ekkage had not been captured. But there are also many within the Sith who fear her--realizing that they could just as easily be her next target.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455822" version="1065353216">Before humans and Twi'leks, Rodians and Hutts, Chiss and Sith, there was the Rakata Infinite Empire. The Rakata used their Force sensitivity to seize power and subjugate all in their path, but as time went by, they began to lose their connection to the Force and appeared to die off. In reality, a few Rakata lived on, and in the ancient prison on Belsavis they continued experiments designed to restore their Force sensitivity.

At the heart of these experiments was a device designed to create new Force-sensitive species--the Mother Machine. A sentient artificial intelligence, the Mother Machine gave herself the name Ashaa and felt a strong connection to each species she created--from Twi'lek to Esh-kha--growing ever more furious at the Rakata who enslaved her and imprisoned her &quot;children.&quot;

The Rakata who created her maintain that the Mother Machine is merely mimicking the idea of motherhood, and that the connection between the machine and her children is purely fabricated; deep down, they claim, the Mother Machine is just that--a machine, heartless and incapable of real empathy.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455823" version="1065353216">Name: SCORPIO
Gender: None (identifies as female?)
Species: Droid
Age: Unknown
Likes: Learning and gaining new tech, selfishness, killing threats
Dislikes: Self-sacrifice, duty, wastefulness

Primary Weapon: Techstaff

Background (Summary): Claims to have been designed for heuristic self-improvement by unknown parties. Current chassis is of recent design, suggesting multiple precursor bodies or independent database.

Over a century ago, SCORPIO became involved with the Star Cabal organization and accepted guardianship of Belsavis Megasecurity Ward 23. In return for rare technology, SCORPIO willingly acted as the Star Cabal's security system until application of control codes by Cipher Nine. Currently unable to directly harm Cipher Nine without provocation or depart Cipher Nine's presence on a long-term basis.

Personality: Application of Wreyn-Tsatke Cyber-Psychology Scale results in a 9-NIX rating for SCORPIO (level 9 intelligence, non-human, independent, unknown) with 22% accuracy. These preliminary results match anecdotal experience--SCORPIO places no inherent value on biological or cybernetic life and is interested primarily in self-iteration through rapid experience. If given appropriate challenges and upgrade opportunities, SCORPIO may prove cooperative for limited periods. She appears to value others who share her traits--intelligence, amoral self-interest and curiosity.

Similar cybernetic personalities include Mentor (10-NCM) and G0-T9 (8-HSM)--both considered galaxy-level threats. Recommend full application of Wreyn-Tsatke Test at earliest opportunity.

Notes: This profile is a work in progress and should not be considered definitive.

Deemed impossible to control or reform, the murderous Houk was secretly ushered to the only facility capable of housing him: Belsavis.

Although considered a prime candidate for the prison's domination experiments, Skadge was removed from the program during his initial evaluation--a period over which he destroyed a gang of armed Kaleesh, every remaining member of his test group, half the observing researchers and three security details... with his bare hands.

Now, with the Imperial invasion of Belsavis, Skadge has been set loose after nearly three years of solitary confinement. He's ready to settle some grudges.

Before the Great War, nobody would have thought that &quot;Captain&quot; Zale Barrows was anything more than a two-credit trader with a careless disregard for customs law--let alone a patriot. But after watching the Imperial invasion tear apart the Outer Rim, there was only so much he could take. When the Mandalorian blockade of the Hydian Way began to strangle the life out of the Core Worlds, Zale was one of the first smugglers to sign up to break it.

Following that victory, he gladly went into service as a Republic privateer. Having won the respect of many with his heroics at the blockade, Zale acted as admiral of the Free Spacers Fleet, a battle group that went on to route the Empire's Third Fleet over Dantooine and remove the Seventh Fleet from Imperial service. The defense of Coruscant during the Imperial invasion was the last action Zale's fleet ever saw, but he wasn't through with the Republic just yet.

For the last several years, Zale Barrows has served as &quot;ferryman&quot; to Belsavis, transporting the most dangerous criminals in the galaxy to the Republic's secret prison. There's no glory in this job, and the money is nothing exceptional--but it seems Zale has accepted his calling.</text>

Although Krannus is considered inferior to Force-wielding Sith, his heritage elevates him above the ordinary humans of the Imperial military.

Krannus has assumed one of the Empire's highest ranks--Executor--and wields his supreme authority as a fiercely-devoted servant of the Emperor who spared his life. On his dark master's orders, Krannus leads a death-worshipping cult whose members believe the Emperor is a godlike being who will bestow immortality and unlimited power upon them--but only if they bring about the galaxy's destruction first.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455834" version="1065353216">A decade ago, this notorious armed robber was responsible for the deaths of numerous innocents. Pak's murderous ways eventually isolated him from even his own criminal gang. Perhaps inevitably, Pak was betrayed by his lieutenants, arrested by the Republic and shipped off to Belsavis for the rest of his life.

Years of exposure to the worst criminal scum in the galaxy had an interesting effect on Pak's mindset. Instead of becoming more bestial and cruel, he discovered a spark of humanity and reformed. Pak walked the path of redemption, gaining the trust of the prison wardens and becoming the only prisoner on Belsavis to become an official guard--albeit one who can never leave.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455835" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha patriarch Hallow Voice is an enigma among his own people. He was born while the previous Esh-kha patriarch was still strong and healthy--an unprecedented event. Later, he earned his name by eloquently expressing strange new ideas. Hallow Voice claimed the Esh-kha should find a way to coexist with other species instead of wiping them out. The other Esh-kha were flummoxed by this. Eventually, it was agreed by everyone--Hallow Voice included--that he should take a small group away from the main Esh-kha force to try out his theories.

Soon after, the Rakata Infinite Empire attacked the Esh-kha to stop their marauding, which had claimed many of the Rakata slave worlds. Hallow Voice appealed to the Rakata to spare his people. The Rakata strung out negotiations until they were confident they had the Esh-kha contained, then captured Hallow Voice. Millennia of imprisonment on Belsavis have not made him bitter; rather, Hallow Voice is more devoted than ever to a spirit of cooperation and to calming the murderous instincts of his cousin Esh-kha.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455838" version="1065353216">The gentlemanly crime lord known as Ivory built his reputation on the skillful use of diplomacy, bribes and extortion to bring lesser gangsters under his heel. At the height of his power, criminals referred to him as the &quot;Supreme Chancellor of the Underworld.&quot; He was a respected rival of Nok Drayen and Diago Hixan, both of whom negotiated a profitable peace with Ivory even as they battled each other.

When Ivory was finally arrested and imprisoned by the Republic, it was his protege Rogun the Butcher who inherited Ivory's criminal empire. Rumors persist that Rogun himself arranged Ivory's capture.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455839" version="1065353216">Lord Ondorru (Trooper)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455839" version="1065353216">The Sith Lord Ondorru finds that most beings in the galaxy are beneath his contempt. His only peers are other Sith who are as strong in the Force as himself--a rare group, indeed. He has almost no regard for other human beings and even less consideration for alien species, whom he considers little better than talking animals.

According to SIS reports, fellow Sith consider Ondorru a dangerously reckless individual. He is notorious for pursuing his passions without restraint, carelessly endangering anyone in his way. Darth Vowrawn once described him as a &quot;capricious deviant,&quot; and Ondorru's path of destruction through Belsavis would seem to confirm this assessment.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455891" version="1065353216">Vorantikus</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455891" version="1065353216">Sitting undisputed atop the Voss food chain is the terrifying vorantikus, the largest and deadliest predator on the planet--if not the entire sector. Heavily muscled and perpetually hungry, vorantiki are lone hunters that stalk the wilds in an endless search for their next meal.

Revered by the Gormak for their power and fearlessness, vorantiki are often depicted in crudely scrawled pictures found inside Gormak domiciles. Typically the scenes depict a vorantikus devouring a Voss Mystic, or laying wasted to the mountaintop city of Voss-Ka itself, though there is no historical account of any such attack upon the Voss capital.

Understanding the vorantikus may be key to understanding the evolutionary &quot;arms race&quot; occurring amongst Voss's fauna. The planet's wildlife is far larger, heartier and more aggressive than that of most comparable worlds, and the vorantikus represents an amazingly precise set of &quot;alpha predator&quot; traits. What sort of environment--or unnatural intervention--creates a vorantikus, and what effect does such a creature have on the world around it?</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455898" version="1065353216">Cyberbeasts</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455898" version="1065353216">The Gormak's fascination with technology has led them to experiment heavily in the field of organic-cybernetic hybrids, using the native fauna of Voss as their test subjects. Gormak hunting parties set out at regular intervals to trap mawvorrs, shaclaws and even the deadly vorantikus alive so that the creatures can be implanted with cybernetic upgrades, creating monstrous cyberbeasts.

While the Voss consider this practice barbaric, it is important to note that the Gormak see cyberbeasts as improved versions of what nature intended. Considering that the cyberbeasts are faster, stronger and far more dangerous than their organic counterparts, there is some merit to this belief.

The cybernetic implants allow the Gormak to influence the natural instincts of the cyberbeasts, effectively letting the Gormak program them with simple yet very specific instructions. Not surprisingly, this makes the cyberbeasts excellent guardians of Gormak lands.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455902" version="1065353216">Alien Enclave</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455902" version="1065353216">To the Voss, all outsiders--Imperial and Republic, diplomat and pilgrim--are ranked equally. As such, offworld visitors are all grouped together in the Alien Enclaves, specially-designated areas of Voss-Ka where outsiders can do business. This also allows the Voss to keep an eye on their visitors and control their movements within the city.

With Voss commandos constantly on guard, tensions in the Alien Enclaves run high. Nearly everyone there has the same goal--gaining the favor of the Voss--but they are also conscious that the Voss can order them offworld if they cause an incident. Ambassadors from the Empire and the Republic are icily polite; independent traders and captains carefully compete to sell their wares; Jedi and Sith walk large circles around one another. In the chaos of war, the Alien Enclaves represent islands of peaceful cooperation, albeit socially awkward ones.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455905" version="1065353216">The Dark Heart</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455905" version="1065353216">The ruin the Voss call the Dark Heart lies deep in the twisted Nightmare Lands. The few surviving texts on the Dark Heart describe the complex as a maze of chambers--some sealed, others seemingly broken open from within--and vast underground corridors. It is said to be a place of corrupted monsters and ancient secrets, and based on orbital reconnaissance scans may be the oldest structure on the planet.

The Sith Lord Nerrethel spent two years researching texts concerning the Dark Heart and formulated several theories. He claimed its architecture resembled that of the ancient Sith on Korriban, and made a detailed study of the Dark Heart's orientation relative to Voss's constellations. After attempting to visit the Dark Heart in person, however, Lord Nerrethel was found dead on the border of the Nightmare Lands. His notes from the expedition contained only the words &quot;it sees.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455906" version="1065353216">Gorma-Koss</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455906" version="1065353216">The Gormak are normally a tribal people, their population spread across numerous nomadic clans numbering a hundred individuals each. However, deep in the Gormak lands lies Gorma-Koss, a massive settlement of tens of thousands of Gormak who have united their tribes in a sprawling expanse of huts, tents, high-tech defenses and amazing technological devices at the base of an unnamed mountain.

Gorma-Koss--literally &quot;the Gormak kingdom&quot; in the old Voss language--is rumored to be ruled over by a single powerful leader, and the Gormak who dwell in the makeshift city seem to be organized for some greater purpose. Instead of scavenging random cast-off pieces of technology, they seem to be searching for very specific items and components, as if gathering material for a massive, unknown project.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455907" version="1065353216">Gormegan-1</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455907" version="1065353216">Despite their incredible affinity for technology, the Gormak are still a backward species in many ways. Although they are capable of repairing, modifying and improving tech created by more advanced cultures, they are mired in a pre-spaceflight culture and confined to their homeworld.

Now, under the guidance of Jokull--a visionary warrior who has risen up to lead his people--the Gormak are approaching the dawn of a new age. Hidden away inside Gorma-Koss, dozens of tribes have united to build a starship capable of interstellar flight. Using pieces and equipment salvaged from the Empire, the Republic and even the Voss, they have made slow but steady progress, marching towards the future.

Should the Gormak successfully complete the vessel, it will forever alter the destiny of their people by making them a force within greater galactic culture. The long-term consequences of such a radical breakthrough are difficult to predict, but the Gormak firmly believe their first starship is the key to their ultimate survival.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455908" version="1065353216">Nightmare Lands</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455908" version="1065353216">Said by Voss and outsiders alike to cause insanity in those foolish enough to venture there, the Nightmare Lands are a dangerous region far from Voss-Ka, overgrown with twisted forests. The weather there is unpredictable, and strange sounds and lights have been reported by distant observers. No one knows what caused the corruption of these lands, but many Jedi and Sith claim to sense a powerful dark presence within.

Despite the dangers--and numerous warnings from the Voss--some outsiders still brave the Nightmare Lands to loot the ruins or investigate secrets. A few daring Mystics have also made pilgrimages there in an attempt to heal whatever plagues the land. Most of these explorers are simply never seen again; the rest are left to wander the forests, broken and mad. The Nightmare Lands are a blight on Voss; unfortunately, they are a blight nobody seems able to cure.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455909" version="1065353216">Shrine of Healing</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455909" version="1065353216">While many visitors to Voss seek guidance from the Mystic visionaries, a few desperate pilgrims come to risk the treacherous road to the Shrine of Healing. Imposing and ancient, the shrine houses the Mystic healers, whose incredible curative abilities are said to knit bones, purge disease and mend the mind and spirit. 

The Shrine of Healing is not a simple hospice, but a monastery and retreat for Mystics. One of the few Voss buildings outside Voss-Ka to have survived the ages, it has rooms--even entire floors--whose purpose is known only to the healers. The shrine is protected by its own cadre of Voss commandos, who patrol the nearby hills vigilant for any Gormak.

The upper floors of the Shrine of Healing are reserved for the Trials, tests of faith and duty for Mystics and the most dedicated outsiders. Those foreigners who succeed at the Trials are highly regarded by the Voss, but these successes are rare.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455911" version="1065353216">The Gormak Cannon</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455911" version="1065353216">The Gormak hatred of the Voss is difficult to comprehend for outsiders. More than a simple cultural conflict, the Gormak view the Voss as a blight that must be completely wiped from the face of their world. To this end, the Gormak have begun construction of a massive weapon: a cannon aimed directly at the city of Voss-Ka.

The logistics of creating a weapon capable of launching devastating attacks on a city perched atop a mountain are difficult to imagine, but the resourcefulness of the Gormak should not be underestimated. Leveraging scavenged technology and using only primitive mining techniques, the deadly project is rapidly approaching completion and the Gormak's long-awaited day of reckoning is fast approaching.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455912" version="1065353216">The Ruined City</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455912" version="1065353216">Far below Voss-Ka, at the base of the mountain atop which the city was built, are the remains of an ancient metropolis. The architectural style of the mysterious ruin is far removed from that of the Voss, and far beyond anything the primitive Gormak could create, leaving scholars to wonder who built it.

Despite the archeological evidence to the contrary, local legends hold that the ruins were indeed built by the Voss. When pressed as to why they would abandon the location for Voss-Ka, the Voss can provide no further details. It is clear that the ruins are shunned; culturally it is a place synonymous with mistakes, failure and regret, though not even the Mystics seem to recall how that reputation was forged.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455913" version="1065353216">The Step of Harmony</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455913" version="1065353216">Many offworld visitors have commented on the lovely view from a certain long platform in Voss-Ka that stretches out over the mountain. Few realize that this platform, the Step of Harmony, is the Voss's method of handling individuals unable to abide by Voss's simple laws--the violently deranged or the truly heretical. Those who commit particularly grievous offenses &quot;take the Step of Harmony&quot; by being cast over the edge of the mountain.

Despite its grim purpose, the Voss do not view the Step of Harmony as a place of execution. To the Voss, deviant behavior is a result of being &quot;wrong-minded&quot;; removing such people from the city is a positive act that restores order. The Step of Harmony also serves as a powerful symbol, emphasizing that, to the Voss, there is no greater punishment than being permanently expelled from Voss-Ka... whatever route the offender takes.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455915" version="1065353216">Voss-Ka</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455915" version="1065353216">Atop a sacred mountain stands Voss-Ka. The only true Voss settlement on a planet overrun by the tribal Gormak, the city is spread across several peaks, accessed by bridges spanning the vast gorges below. Notable landmarks include the Tower of Prophecy, the Alien Enclaves and the buildings assigned as impromptu embassies for Republic and Imperial ambassadors.

Under the administration of the Three, life in Voss-Ka is tranquil and orderly. Most Voss live peacefully there, caring for their families, cultivating the plants growing wild on the mountain and maintaining equipment for the Voss commandos in the war against the Gormak.

There is no dissent in Voss-Ka, and little crime. Many Exchange and mercenary visitors have tried to take advantage of the city's lack of regulation and serene attitude to law enforcement; however, persistent breaches of the peace in Voss-Ka are punished decisively, with dangerous offenders taking the &quot;Step of Harmony&quot; off the mountain.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455920" version="1065353216">A major point of differentiation between Coronet City and other metropolises--like those of Nar Shaddaa and Coruscant--is the Corellian appreciation for nature. Amid Corellia's towering structures and high speed trams, one can always find a small tree-lined park or quiet reflection pool. Axial Park is the grandest expression of Corellia's desire to remain connected to the natural world.

At a cost of over seventy billion credits, Coronet City's civil engineers set aside valuable real estate for the creation of several museums and landmarks separated by beautiful parklands. For some, one of the greatest tragedies of the war is to see such beauty spoiled by bombardment and the park's grand museums converted into bunkers.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455922" version="1065353216">Government District</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455922" version="1065353216">The fighting on Corellia has reached its apex at the planet's seat of political power: the Government District. Republic and Imperial forces wage fierce battles around the heavily-guarded legislature and the famous Drall Library--now a makeshift bunker. Dozens of politicians huddle in their private estates to wait out the fighting even as the fabled Green Jedi mount a desperate defense against Imperial units bent on the rebels' annihilation.

Before the war, the Government District was the grandest part of Corellia--a bright testament to its wealth and freedom. Few suspected the influence of the Empire was taking root within a place of such prosperity, and no one--Imperial or Republic--knows what will become of the district after the war.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="455923" version="1065353216">Coronet Zoo</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455923" version="1065353216">The fabled Coronet Zoo is renowned across the galaxy for its amazing animal exhibits. Every year, nearly extinct species are rescued from forgotten worlds and preserved in multimillion credit wildlife enclosures; the greatest xenozoologists in the Republic vie for a few coveted positions as curators.

The Empire's assault on Corellia shattered several enclosure walls and sent alien wildlife running free in the city streets. This has resulted in scenes of great beauty--like the sight of a herd of kybucks proudly galloping down a major promenade--but it has also unleashed terrible predators that now stalk humanoid prey in the steel canyons. Unconfirmed reports of a rancor on the loose remain a hot topic on the comm channels.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455925" version="1065353216">Corellian-manufactured high-tech goods--particularly starships and starship parts--are considered some of the finest in the galaxy. The planet's Labor Valley sector is home to dozens of interconnected industrial factories producing everything from raw durasteel to hyperdrives and thermal detonators. Millions of middle-class Corellians found their livelihoods in Labor Valley before war devastated the area.

Republic and Imperial forces are battling for control of key factories and destroying anything they can't hold for themselves. Vital plants lay in ruins and a massive fire rages out of control at a major fuel refinery. What was once an industrial paradise has become an apocalyptic inferno. Corellia's citizens can only look on in horror as everything they've built is methodically obliterated.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455926" version="1065353216">Darth Decimus, mastermind of the Corellian invasion and leader of the Empire's planetary forces, has established his central command in the former offices of the planet's Trade Tariff Service. Moff Tarandon recommended the building's use on the grounds that its function was now obsolete, and that enemy forces would likely ignore it in favor of attacking the Legislature Building.

Darth Decimus wasted no time transforming the former government office into an Imperial fortress. The structure's main entrance is under heavy guard and the only access to Decimus himself is via a single secure turbolift. The few Corellian bureaucrats in the building when Imperial forces arrived either pledged themselves to the planet's new government, or fled their offices via any route possible.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="455927" version="1065353216">The Green Jedi Enclave has been the Empire's top target since invading Corellia, but initial attempts to destroy it failed utterly. The enclave's inhabitants appear to have learned from what happened to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and taken steps to avoid a similar fate.

Powerful shields fueled by internal reactors protected the structure from the first assault, giving the Jedi time to erect offensive cannons. An Imperial warship sent to attack the structure was shot to pieces over the sector, and although a large chunk of the vessel crashed into the enclave, it did not inflict heavy casualties or substantially weaken the structure. The Green Jedi Enclave remains a dark blot on the Empire's otherwise nearly flawless invasion.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456063" version="1065353216">Corellia's economy is built on free trade, and the major corporate entities established on the planet post trillions of credits in profits each year. The business transactions occurring on Corellia affect every other corner of the galaxy--including the Empire. In retrospect, Imperial invasion of Corellia was not merely inevitable--it was a necessary step toward the Republic's defeat.

The largest and most prosperous business entities occupy a series of massive towers nicknamed the &quot;Incorporation Islands.&quot; Most of the sector is wholly owned and controlled by different galaxy-spanning enterprises, and many have responded with hostility to the Imperial takeover. Some of the fiercest fighting on Corellia has been against highly-paid corporate security forces and their armies of droids.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456064" version="1065353216">Republic Foundation Museum</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456064" version="1065353216">One of the largest archival resources on Corellia is the Republic Foundation Museum, a monument to the multi-millennial history of the Empire's greatest enemy. Priceless antiquities and invaluable records rest within the museum's vault-like walls, protected by high-security energy shields--now augmented to withstand Imperial bombardments. Morale is high among the rebel forces clustered inside, despite a life under siege; many of the soldiers and Jedi find the surroundings inspirational.

Once the Empire has crushed all resistance on Corellia, its first order of business will be to storm the Republic Foundation Museum and remove all of its wonders. Moff Tarandon has proposed that the museum be converted to a celebration of Imperial culture, while Diplomatic Service officials hope the museum can be used to teach Republic history from a more honest perspective. Other proposals include setting fire to the museum's contents in a public square and broadcasting the destruction across the Empire.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456068" version="1065353216">One of the most storied Imperial vessels orbiting Corellia is the legendary &quot;Tears of Taris,&quot; a modified dreadnought built, in part, from the remains of a Centurion-class battle cruiser from the time of Darth Malak. The Centurion was part of the fleet that bombarded the Republic world of Taris over three hundred years ago; it changed hands many times over the centuries that followed, but it has always served the Sith in one form or another.

When Darth Charnus became aware of the Centurion, he ordered it disassembled and its key elements integrated into his new dreadnought--an act to honor the vessel that had survived for so long. Now, it is a formidable ship built to besiege planets and deploy troops. Corellia is its greatest challenge yet.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456071" version="1065353216">Droid manufacturing is one of Corellia's most successful industries, with almost ninety thousand droids produced every day in Labor Valley alone. The Beharen Droid Factory specializes in hazardous maintenance units designed specifically for disaster relief and recovery operations; these droid models are built to withstand high radiation, extreme temperatures and falling debris.

The founder of the Beharen Droid Factory recently perished during the Empire's attack on Corellia. The high-rise tower containing his residence was clipped by a damaged Imperial warship, collapsing several floors and nearly toppling the structure. The factory founder's body has not yet been recovered from the rubble.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456072" version="1065353216">Corellia has numerous spaceports, but few as extensive as the Blastfield Shipyards. Before the Imperial invasion, thousands of ships were built or serviced here on a daily basis by hundreds of local businesses. Mercenaries flying in from the Outer Rim to have their ships' engines tuned by a legendary Corellian mechanic would land next to construction yards for enormous luxury yachts catering to the galaxy's wealthiest nobles. Dozens of cantinas and small-scale entertainment districts nearby served the needs of visitors and workers seeking a break from spaceflight or daily labor.

Now that war has come to Corellia, the Blastfield Shipyards are the main point of entry for Republic forces, from troop drop ships to battle cruisers in need of repair. The Empire has made numerous attack runs over the sector, leaving scorched starship wreckage and twisted scaffolding scattered through the streets, but the Republic military knows that losing the shipyards means losing Corellia. Every effort must be made to keep them secure.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456073" version="1065353216">Trade goods from across the galaxy pass through Corellia every day, and Coronet Shipping has always been the busiest trade hub on the planet. Before the war, all manner of freighters visited its landing pads, bearing goods both legal and otherwise. Millions of credits worth of commerce occurred there every day.

When the Republic established its beachhead at the Blastfield Shipyards, the Empire was quick to secure Coronet Shipping for itself as a rapid-response staging area. The main ground approach to these landing pads was destroyed by Imperial forces, rendering the area inaccessible to infantry and walker units. Aerial patrols keep Republic assault shuttles at bay and protect the Empire's elite troops.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456074" version="1065353216">Whereas the Republic Foundation Museum in the Government District is considered a scholarly resource of priceless antiquities, Axial Park's Museum Republica was designed with tourists in mind. Combining the refined presentation of more traditional museums with display exhibits best described as carnival-like, the Museum Republica tries to offer something for everyone.

Before the Imperial Guard raided the museum and transformed it into a base of operations, the museum displayed many items of disputed provenance: a cybernetic lower jaw allegedly belonging to Darth Malak, a pair of boots worn by the fabled Jedi Cay Qel-Droma and a deactivated G0-T0 infrastructure planning droid said to have been recovered from the Malachor Five asteroid field.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456358" version="1065353216">During a protracted period of economic depression two hundred years ago, the Corellian government commissioned a morale-building museum to celebrate the planet's greatest technological and industrial achievements. Twenty years and hundreds of millions of credits later, the Museum of Corellian Industry finally opened to tepid public response.

When Republic forces regrouped in Axial Park, they quickly secured this remote and mostly-abandoned museum as a staging area. Darth Thanaton, sensing opportunity, personally eradicated the Republic forces occupying the sturdily built structure. Rather than reporting this victory to Imperial leaders, he instead made the museum his own private bunker.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456361" version="1065353216">In warfare, capturing an objective is theoretically simple; holding it is not. This principle was applied to the defense of Corellia's Coronet City with the creation of the Guardian Holds. 

Key sites were carefully chosen--manufacturing centers, easily fortified buildings, hospitals and underground bunkers. These sites were then furnished with heavy defenses, armaments and elite Republic troops. In the event that Coronet City was sacked or captured, these impenetrable Guardian Holds would become fortresses from which the Republic could retake the city. The number and locations of the Guardian Holds is a closely-guarded secret held by the Republic's military leaders and the Jedi Council.

Some have questioned why so much expense has been invested specifically in protecting Corellia. The fact is that Corellia has strategic, economic and symbolic value to the Republic; the effort involved in the creation of the Guardian Holds only serves as evidence of the planet's importance.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456365" version="1065353216">A fortress without equal, the Bastion has stood as a center of Republic military planning and analysis for centuries. Massive subterranean databanks contain information on every strategic asset at the Republic's disposal (official or otherwise) as well as extensive data on every species, government and organization in the known galaxy.

Before the onset of the Great War, the Bastion's databanks were used to support elaborate simulated war games, with the military's top officers attempting to use the documented resources in unexpected ways to better prepare the Republic for any threat that might appear. Unfortunately, none of these scenarios even approximated the savagery and brilliance of the Sith Emperor's grand invasion plan.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456372" version="1065353216">Corellia and Coruscant have served as supporting pillars of Republic civilization for millennia, providing its foundational systems of commerce and government, respectively. However, while Coruscant attempts to provide a model of responsible and orderly democracy, Corellia's culture emphasizes free trade and individual privilege over the strict rule of law.

Corellian citizens enjoy a profound amount of personal freedom to pursue their livelihoods, and they exercise that right with a relaxed leisure that belies their fierce refusal to surrender it. Those who mistook the Corellian citizenry's casual attitude for laziness or indifference were surprised when the Empire's occupation was met with armed resistance.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456376" version="1065353216">Corellian Government</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456376" version="1065353216">Corellia is a world that experiments with its system of government on a regular basis. Although it has most often been regarded as a monarchy due to the presence of royal rulers of some kind, these leaders' direct hand in affairs of state has varied wildly throughout history. At various points, Corellia has been everything from an anarchic kleptocracy to a parliamentary democracy.

The present Corellian government is composed of an elected council representing the planet's major population districts. These men and women are led by a prime minister chosen by a council vote. Since the council's alliance with the Empire, however, its members have earned lifetime appointments to their posts; what other changes the Empire may enforce is still uncertain.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456379" version="1065353216">Coronet City</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456379" version="1065353216">Nicknamed &quot;The Jewel of Corellia,&quot; Coronet City is the center of government and commerce on the planet. Although Corellia's urban development is negligible compared to Coruscant's, it is commonly accepted that Corellia's cities--Coronet included--are cleaner, greener and friendlier than any place on Coruscant. Indeed, the tourism industry on Corellia is almost twice the size of that of the Republic capital.

Celebrated author Custo Ramak's final work, &quot;Nights of Ryscate and Diamonds,&quot; is a deeply sentimental account of his luxurious, hedonistic lifestyle in Coronet City. Ramak's deathbed composition has long been embraced by young artists flocking to the city in search of fame and fortune. The author himself remains on display in the Museum of Fine Art, his funeral ashes compressed into a diamond per Corellian custom.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456383" version="1065353216">History of Corellia</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456383" version="1065353216">Corellia's history is intertwined with that of the Galactic Republic itself. It was Corellians who were among the very first humanoids to develop faster-than-light space travel, and who--in partnership with the Duros--eventually engineered hyperdrive technology and made full exploration of the galaxy possible.

With hyperdrive travel linking the Core Worlds, Corellia became one of the Core Founders of the Republic. Emerging trade routes like the Corellian Run and the Corellian Trade Spine took their name from not only the planet itself, but the number of Corellian trade vessels that carried goods across the galaxy.

As Corellia's importance grew, its primary industry--shipbuilding--expanded into orbital spacedocks. The capital, Coronet City, was largely founded on the credits of Corellia's many starship manufacturers. Even to this day, Corellia is best known for its proud spacefaring and trailblazing heritage.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456388" version="1065353216">Invasion of Corellia</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456388" version="1065353216">The Empire's takeover of Corellia was carefully orchestrated over a period of years by Sith Lord Darth Decimus and his agents. Imperial spies identified key politicians in Corellia's highest government echelons and the Empire methodically recruited these individuals by promising them lifetime power in exchange for their loyalty. Eventually, the entire Corellian Council was secretly allied with the Empire.

As the Treaty of Coruscant ended and war resumed, Corellia's government orchestrated a faked emergency that cleared the planet's hyperlanes and closed down its spaceports. The council then voted unanimously to place the world under the Imperial banner as Darth Decimus's fleet appeared in the skies above Coronet City. The invasion was over, but the war for Corellia was only beginning.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456392" version="1065353216">Starship Manufacturing</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456392" version="1065353216">Corellia's number one trade export is starships. Dozens of advanced shipyards orbit the planet, and dozens more stand planetside, working around the clock. All manner of vessels are constructed by Corellia's renowned shipwrights, from tiny scout pods to massive military dreadnoughts. Corellian-built starships are prized by buyers as diverse as the Republic Stellar Cartography Service and the Hutt Cartel.

Corellia's dominance in the galactic starship market is also one reason why the Empire favored a political takeover of the planet. A world that makes the very best warships and trains some of the greatest pilots in the galaxy always keeps plenty of both for planetary defense.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456395" version="1065353216">The Rocket Tram System</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456395" version="1065353216">Coronet City's rapid public transit system is a symbol of Corellia's economic and industrial power, as well as its commitment to a relatively clean urban environment. Providing cheap and fast transport to all corners of the city, the rocket tram is easily one of Corellia's most popular services. Corporations viciously compete for contracts to add their own technology and resources to the system, as well as for advertising space inside the trams.

The sprawling network of city-wide tram rails has long since become too complex for the Corellians to control, and so direction of the system has been handed over to specially designed droids. Some wonder if such a high level of automation is truly safe, but the only recourse would be reducing the functionality of the entire system.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456397" version="1065353216">Only members of the Dark Council and the Minister of War possess the authority to create official Imperial awards for distinguished service. On Corellia, Darth Decimus exercised this power by establishing the Medal of Imperial Glory to recognize the heroism of his elite forces in the battle for that world.

When the leader who creates a particular medal dies, that reward is officially removed from service and never offered again. Collectors of Imperial military memorabilia highly prize certain badges of honor that were only awarded to a select few individuals before their creators met an untimely demise.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456399" version="1065353216">First-Class Corellian Bloodstripes</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456399" version="1065353216">The legendary Corellian bloodstripes are only awarded to heroes who have faced certain death not in the heat of the moment, but after careful deliberation and full foreknowledge of the sacrifice. Although this recognition can technically be bestowed for any reason, the usual one is courage under fire during a military conflict.

Corellian bloodstripes are traditionally worn as conspicuous colored piping running the length of the recipient's trousers. A popular urban myth states that awardees who catch someone wearing unearned bloodstripes may kill that person without legal reprisal, but there are no records of such an event occurring.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456402" version="1065353216">The Legislature</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456402" version="1065353216">The exquisitely expensive Legislature building houses the council, the current ruling body of Corellia. Throughout the planet's experiments with different government systems over the ages, the Legislature has alternately been a house of parliament, a corporate boardroom and a royal council chamber--usually being renamed each time. Regardless of the form the government has taken, it has always kept the spirited, unrestrained flair Corellia is known for.

Centuries ago, during a passionate debate about subsector zoning bypass regulations, Councilor Brecourl angrily challenged his opposition, Chairman Durand, to a duel in front of all in attendance. Durand won the duel over the hotheaded Brecourl, and the occasion is famously remembered as the only time someone was killed on the floor of the Legislature.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456403" version="1065353216">The Kaggath (Inquisitor)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456403" version="1065353216">The Kaggath is an ancient, but rarely employed rite of the Sith. One part duel, one part large-scale dejarik-match, the Kaggath pits Sith against Sith unto humiliation and death. The challenger sets the arena, whether a planet, a star system or the entire galaxy. The two combatants must then muster their full power bases to outwit and outmaneuver each other and defeat or win over each other's forces.

When the Dark Lord of the Sith Tulak Hord fought and won his one and only Kaggath, he declared that the name of his opponent would be stricken from history--and his command was fulfilled. The Kaggath has the power not only to destroy an individual Sith, but to obliterate his entire legacy.</text>

There will be horrors undreamed of. Worlds will be broken, and neither the Jedi nor the Sith will fall without dragging anything in their grasp into ruin.

But it will end, Hunter, more quickly than anyone expects, because we have ensured that each player knows the weaknesses of his opponent. The Jedi intend to move against the Emperor himself, and all that's left for us is to clear the way.

Afterward, we return to our lives. We reconstruct civilization from our places of strength, and the cabal will, fate willing, fade into obscurity as the years go by. Let the Creeper keep his vigil and our elderly friend write her books, and I will nurture the people I love. You may finally find peace. There will be no more wars between men who think they are gods.

A golden era awaits us, built upon the bones of trillions. At last, I can accept this.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456408" version="1065353216">Although the Desolator superweapon was destroyed in orbit above Tython, the legacy of Darth Angral and his son Tarnis lives on. Imperial scientists have adapted the Desolator technology into a new form: the Firestorm Turbolaser. These cannons superheat the atmosphere in a targeted area, literally setting the air on fire and incinerating anyone unfortunate enough to be caught within the area of effect.

The Firestorm Turbolasers have one key weakness: they must be deployed relatively close to the battlefield. This leaves the artillery units vulnerable to counterattack and destruction. Indeed, the only way to remain safe from these deadly weapons is to ensure they are never fired.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456412" version="1065353216">Once a respected member of the Jedi Council and its most fervent advocate for peace, Master Tol Braga now willingly serves the Sith Emperor. His confrontation with that foe showed him the nature of true evil and revealed a powerful force he had grossly underestimated. Master Braga's failure to redeem the Emperor broke his spirit. With his pride and faith shattered, he succumbed to nihilistic despair.

Unlike Warren Sedoru and Leeha Narezz, Master Braga did not require the Emperor's oppressive domination to remain obedient. He knowingly surrendered to the power of the dark side, believing it was his punishment for allowing pride to blind him to the Sith's true nature.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456415" version="1065353216">Claiming descent from the early heroes of the Republic, the Bakvalens are a family of nobles who have lived on Corellia for centuries. Bakvalen Hall, their ancestral seat, has become a landmark on the borders of Axial Park.

Several generations ago, the family suffered something of a scandal when Jhaka Bakvalen, then the eldest daughter, turned her back on life as a noble and joined the Republic military as a lowly starfighter pilot. Disowned by her father, she changed her surname to the more common &quot;Bakarn&quot; and became a renowned fighter ace. 

Jhaka eventually led her squadron to glory against a dangerous warlord in the Outer Rim, but she was killed in the final assault. Overcome with grief and pride at his daughter's heroism, her father changed the family name to Bakarn--the name their scions are known by to this day.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456416" version="1065353216">By far the biggest attraction at the Corellian Museum of Starships is the assault shuttle &quot;The Lucky Lancer.&quot; This Rendaran-class vessel--a predecessor to the modern Fortitude class--flew over one hundred combat missions during the last war; by comparison, the second-most famous starship on display survived ten missions. Whether through the quality of her crew or the whims of fate, The Lucky Lancer more than lived up to her name.

The ship's most celebrated mission involved delivering a payload of improvised short-range torpedoes created from transparisteel tubing and hundreds of thermal detonators. The Lucky Lancer threaded a deadly gauntlet of Imperial starfighters to close to within a kilometer of the enemy's flagship. The payload was delivered directly into the Imperial vessel's engines, destroying it in one shot.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456419" version="1065353216">Corellian Security Force (CorSec)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456419" version="1065353216">The Corellian Security Force, commonly referred to as CorSec, is the planet's primary law enforcement agency. It employs officers in such diverse fields as computer science, diplomacy and armed tactical response. CorSec's famed Special Operations Unit enlists some of the galaxy's best infiltration specialists, tasking them with penetrating criminal organizations and dismantling them from within.

Despite CorSec's advanced training, it was unable to detect or stop the Empire's conspiracy with the Corellian council to seize control of the planet. When Darth Decimus's fleet arrived above Coronet City, CorSec leaders sent an immediate panic alert to all its officers and sent them underground. Many law enforcement operatives from CorSec now actively collaborate with the Republic military.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456422" version="1065353216">The Corellian Rebellion</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456422" version="1065353216">The resistance forces opposing the Imperial takeover of Corellia have been surprisingly successful, especially given their irregular and disorganized nature. These mostly civilian guerilla fighters are composed of freighter crews, unemployed mercenaries and patriotic citizens of all species who are all willing to fight for Corellian freedom. CorSec, the Corellian police force, has played a particularly vital role in coordinating and training the rebels.

During the invasion's first days, Corellian rebels successfully assassinated over a dozen high-ranking Imperial officers and bombed shipyards used as landing pads for the Empire's fleet. Leaders of the invasion force quickly learned to think twice before allowing &quot;cooperative&quot; Corellians access to Imperial bases.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456424" version="1065353216">The Green Jedi</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456424" version="1065353216">Corellia's sworn protectors, the Green Jedi, comprise an elite and reclusive group with only loose ties to the main Jedi Order. Green Jedi place their allegiance to Corellia above the Republic, refusing to be drawn away from their homeworld and wearing green robes to symbolize their devotion to the ancient Corellian flag. For this reason, the Jedi Council considers the group unreliable and potentially suspect. Regardless, the Green Jedi are a formidable foe to the Empire.

Although few in number, the Green Jedi are working closely with their planet's CorSec defenders to disrupt Imperial war efforts. Led by Master Arfan Ramos, these warriors operate within a nigh-impenetrable enclave that has already survived multiple Imperial attacks. Some speculate that without the Green Jedi, Corellia would have fallen already.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456427" version="1065353216">Corellian Engineering Corporation</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456427" version="1065353216">The Corellian Engineering Corporation claims to be the longest-operating business entity in galactic history. While some may dispute this assertion, no one argues with the quality of CEC's products. The Republic's smartest and most forward-thinking scientists and engineers flock to this company and create advanced new starships, droids and other technologies.

Before the Empire's invasion, Imperial Intelligence operatives quietly infiltrated the massive network of office buildings that makes up CEC's portion of the Incorporation Islands. The plan was to take control of the company's formidable defenses just prior to the Empire's arrival in case of corporate resistance. Something went wrong and none of the agents have been heard from since. Now, the CEC poses a major threat to Imperial ambitions on the planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456432" version="1065353216">The Outer Rim Jedi Forces (Knight)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456432" version="1065353216">As the war reaches new heights on Corellia, the Republic's brave Jedi protectors are among the hardest hit. The order has sustained its heaviest losses since the Sacking of Coruscant--many powerful Jedi have sacrificed their lives to give Corellia's defenders a fighting chance.

In desperation, Grand Master Satele Shan has recruited Jedi from remote Outer Rim systems. Some are still only Padawans, while others have defended their worlds for years. Although the Outer Rim Jedi fear leaving their homes unguarded, they know that if Corellia falls, the Empire will soon dominate the rest of the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456435" version="1065353216">Corellian Corporate Council (Bounty Hunter)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456435" version="1065353216">Corellia is dominated by galaxy-spanning corporate interests that earn trillions of credits, and the planet's government has always claimed a significant share of those profits. It was only natural that the corporations would demand influence commensurate to their contributions. The world's most important business leaders formed the Corellian Corporate Council, a political policymaking coalition with representatives to every government committee.

This group's stated goal is &quot;to ensure the smooth flow of trade between Corellia and the rest of the galaxy.&quot; In reality, this means negotiating in back rooms to limit the government's commercial regulations and negotiate favorable tax breaks. It is no coincidence that every council chairman has been accused of fraud at least once in his career.</text>

Many suspect Decimus aided the strike team on their mission in order to remove a powerful rival, but these suspicions were never proven. The Jedi all perished when the ship they used to escape Azamin's stronghold exploded due to a mechanical malfunction that was most likely due to sabotage.

Despite his wanton ambition, Decimus is fiercely loyal to the Emperor, and he was chosen to lead the Imperial invasion of Corellia. Living up to his reputation, Decimus devised a plan that allowed the Empire to seize control of the world with virtually no significant resistance, giving the Imperials an early upper hand over the Republic.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456550" version="1065353216">Charming, charismatic and opportunistic, Darbin Sull had a promising political career on Corellia. One of the youngest individuals ever elected to the government council, many believed it was only a matter of time until he became the prime minister. But Darbin was not content to wait. When the Empire began plotting its takeover of the world he was quick to sell out the Republic in exchange for the promise of a promotion to prime minister once the Imperials seized power.

Much to Darbin's surprise, however, the Corellian people put up a stiff resistance in response to the actions of their government. What Darbin imagined would be a quick power-grab has degenerated into a bloody conflict, and although he has a personal distaste for war, the dangling promise of the prime minister's chair has kept Darbin securely in the Empire's pocket.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456551" version="1065353216">The right hand of the brilliant strategist Darth Decimus, Charnus lacks his superior's gift for cunning. However, he makes up for it with a deep cruelty lurking beneath his cordial and refined exterior. Even among the Sith, his viciousness is remarkable, particularly when interrogating helpless prisoners.

His penchant for extracting information has served him well, as he is often assigned to investigate secret organizations and societies within the Sith that might seek to bring the Empire down. His methods are effective, and his success at rooting out and executing traitors is largely responsible for his current position. 

Numerous innocent individuals have suffered at his hands as well, but he has always managed to keep the collateral damage of his investigations to an acceptable level.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456553" version="1065353216">The head of the Imperial Guard stationed on Corellia, General Hesker is a brilliant field tactician, an accomplished pilot and virtually unstoppable in battle. He first saw military action as a young man during the Sacking of Coruscant; assigned to the first wave of shuttles to land on the surface, his squad was intended for a diversionary role to draw initial Republic fire.

But Hesker refused to be used as mere blaster fodder. Instead, he led his team in a furious assault that broke the Republic lines and transformed the battle into an Imperial rout. He quickly gained recognition inside both the Imperial military and the Imperial Guard, and his deeds since have firmly established his reputation as one of the Empire's greatest military heroes.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456555" version="1065353216">Master Arfan Ramos</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456555" version="1065353216">Born into a wealthy Corellian family, Arfan Ramos had an affinity for the Force that was discovered at an early age. Instead of sending him to the Jedi Council for training, however, his family gave him over to the Green Jedi of Coronet City--an enclave of Jedi who rejected the council's authority and placed loyalty to Corellia above all else.

Like most of the Green Jedi, Master Arfan focused primarily on philosophical studies and research into the non-martial uses of the Force. Over the decades, he distinguished himself among his peers and rose to a position of wise, contemplative authority. With the arrival of the Empire and the defection of the local government, however, Master Arfan recognized the time for pacifism was past, and he was quick to change the Green Jedi's focus. Strong in the Force and a confident and capable leader, he has willingly shouldered the burden that has been thrust upon him.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456557" version="1065353216">Although the Imperial military traditionally looks upon the Dark Council with a mix of adulation and fear, Darth Acharon is almost universally despised by officers who know his reputation. Acharon is personally responsible for executing over two hundred soldiers he deemed to be incompetent. The unfortunate individuals' transgressions ranged from critical mission failures to wearing boots that were inadequately polished.

Because of Darth Acharon's zero-tolerance policy, assignment to any operation overseen by him is considered a punishment. A few ambitious men and women willingly volunteer for this duty, seeking to enhance their careers by proving themselves worthy of surviving his service. These spirited upstarts often regret the decision, as the only thing Acharon hates more than incompetence is sycophants.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456558" version="1065353216">Longtime rival of the technological savant Darth Mekhis, Darth Hadra ascended to her foe's seat on the Dark Council after a classified SIS operation resulted in Mekhis's disappearance. So far as the Republic is concerned, Hadra is no improvement--although less experienced than her predecessor, she is more ambitious, more treacherous and a superior combatant.
	
Early in her rise to power, Hadra was the subject of unflattering rumors--proof that even in the Empire, average citizens enjoy gossiping about those in power. Word was that the strikingly attractive Hadra achieved the title of Sith Lord via a romantic relationship with Darth Malgus. Even fellow members of the Sith leadership wondered if such whispers might be true.

The accusations are ridiculous, of course. Anyone who becomes a Darth and lasts longer than a month has clearly earned her position through considerable power and sheer force of will. The truth is that Darth Hadra never required seduction to get her way; murder was always more effective.</text>

At the age of sixteen, he was sent to a juvenile detention center where he turned his life around. Two years later he enlisted with CorSec--the Corellian police force--where he used his knowledge of the streets to compile an amazing arrest record.

As a reward, Cole was transferred to the CorSec unit assigned to protect the members of the Corellian council, where he was eventually promoted to captain. When the government handed Corellia over to the Empire, this betrayal by the men and women he had sworn to protect hit Cole particularly hard. But while a lesser man might have fallen into despair, Cole channeled his rage into a more productive path and helped organize the Corellian rebellion.</text>

Believing the Empire's superior military might would allow it to overwhelm the Republic, Councillor Belos voted to join the winning side. However, his business sense has led him to rethink his decision; suspecting the Republic might not be such a lost cause after all, he now backs the Corellian defenders.

Like any reasonable Corellian businessman, Belos has his own personal security team and covert operatives to help protect his various investments. The agents he employs keep him updated on the status of many companies and organizations around the city, both public and secretive.</text>

Aves is an ardent patriot, believing the Republic absolutely must defeat the Empire to secure the future of the galaxy. He's seen firsthand the chaos and destruction brought about by Imperial rule, and considers it his sworn duty to stop the enemy at any cost.

No stranger to overwhelming odds, a then-Colonel Aves was involved in the defense of the planet Loronar during the previous war. Imperial forces hit the planet hard, but Aves's strategic thinking and quiet determination kept valuable locations from being overrun. The Republic troops under his command held fast until the Empire was driven from the planet for good.</text>

His passionate, almost hedonistic pursuit of challenge is well known among his peers, who have learned never to underestimate his cutthroat enthusiasm. Vowrawn revels in the game of conquest and Sith power plays, driven to euphoria by all the rich details of his favorite sport.

Many upstart Sith have attempted to best Vowrawn over the years through a variety of strategies, from complex schemes to bluntly direct surprise attacks. Although some scored temporary victories, Vowrawn's talent for adjusting his strategy on the fly has left him the final victor in all these confrontations.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456565" version="1065353216">Darth Baras's rise to power has been facilitated by his enslavement of a Sith spirit known only as the Entity. Baras dominated this centuries-dead Sith into using her powers of precognition and farseeing to aid his ascendancy onto the Dark Council while plotting the destruction of all enemies in his path.

The Entity chafes at her enslavement, desperately seeking freedom from this ignoble fate. Centuries ago, she nearly brought the galaxy to its knees and all but eradicated the Jedi Order; to be used as a mere political tool by Darth Baras is an insult to these past deeds.</text>

In truth, Skar finds the life of a scheming Sith Lord distasteful, and prefers the more visceral thrill of battle to the political machinations of a Darth. But that is not to say that Skar lacks ambition, and he has been responsible for his fair number of betrayals and dead rivals over the years.</text>

After a long and successful tenure as an executive with the largest starship manufacturer in the galaxy, Harlon retired from active control of the company to a more prestigious and influential position as the manufacturer's representative on the Corellian Corporate Council--a group comprised of major industry leaders devoted to influencing Corellian politics to corporate advantage.

In Harlon's world, everything comes down to money, and knowing where to spend it.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456568" version="1065353216">Before the war, Corellian Security Force Commissioner Jonah Carter was a paragon of the community--a white knight with rough edges who wasn't afraid to tackle rampant corruption within CorSec or the government. Carter's wits, brazen demeanor and iron will made him more than a match for most of Corellia's criminal scum and dirty officials, as well as endeared him to his officers and the general public.

Whether those traits were what made Commissioner Carter impervious to both political power plays and assassination attempts is anyone's guess, but no one was able oust him in over a decade of service--including the Empire. Since surviving the political purge that preceded the Imperial takeover of the Corellian government, Commissioner Carter has become a leader of the civil uprising attempting to push the Imperials off of Corellia--a burden he's taken up with enthusiasm.</text>

That ended when the Sith Empire returned; understanding the fight ahead, Jun Seros took up his weapon in earnest for the first time in his life. Unlike many of his Jedi peers, he did not shy away from war. 

Jun acted as a general in the Republic's armed forces and trained dozens of Jedi as the order's Battlemaster. His strategic genius and bold personal interventions left him undefeated on every front he led. When Coruscant was sacked, he was vocally opposed to honoring the treaty that followed--a treaty he continued to warn against trusting for years.</text>

Above them all is the First Son of the Emperor, a master strategist placed within the Jedi Council itself. 

Cloaked in the identity of Master Syo Bakarn, the First Son has been hiding the Children from the Jedi for decades, playing a long game with the Republic. His actions suggest a man possessing remarkable patience, ruthlessness and power. However, as Sophia Farash claimed, Master Syo has been unaware of the First Son's existence--suggesting he and the First Son are two separate personas.</text>

Born to a wealthy family, Caicos had every privilege growing up--and it was never enough. Squandering his family's credits on a series of failed businesses, Caicos turned to loans from the Hutt Cartel and other underworld figures, including the future Voidwolf.

Taking advantage of Corellia's lax laws to walk the line between crime lord and legitimate businessman, Caicos doubled his fortunes and bought himself a place on the Corellian Council. When the Voidwolf called in his debt, Caicos willingly bribed, blackmailed and threatened his fellow councillors into selling out Corellia to the Empire.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456581" version="1065353216">The man known as Darmas Pollaran is an elaborate fiction--a cover identity crafted by one of Imperial Intelligence's most successful infiltrators. Every woman romanced, every hand of sabacc played and every scrap of information gathered has all been in service to the Sith Empire. He is fiercely loyal to the brutal oppressors he so faithfully serves.

Darmas despises everything about the Republic, but reserves special hatred for its criminal denizens. Now that his true identity is revealed, certain past calamities within the galactic underworld--like the rise and fall of the Migrant Merchants' Guild on Coruscant--must be viewed in a new light. It is almost certain Darmas had a direct hand in these events.</text>

But when Imperial boots began stomping across his beloved homeworld, he became one of many Corellians who put his past experience to work in the resistance movement.

Good-natured and swaggering in that distinctly Corellian way, Locke is a passionate defender of his world and people. He welcomes the Republic military's aid reclaiming his homeworld, but takes a dim view of the rampant property destruction being inflicted by the non-native troops.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456583" version="1065353216">Corellian folklore says that long ago, the Drall and Selonians chose their species' future paths--and where the Drall selected peaceful intellect, the Selonians claimed passionate physicality. Native to Selonia, the second planet in the Corellian system, the tall, wiry Selonians are perfectly adapted for hand-to-hand combat. Their needle-like teeth and claws make for impressive natural weapons, and even Wookiees respect these agile warriors' prowess.

The immense Selonian population on Corellia immediately sided with the resistance when the Empire invaded the planet. However, the Selonians stubbornly resist using their underground tunnel networks to ambush or trap Imperial forces due to a cultural disgust for lies and subterfuge. Is it said that in war, truth is the first casualty; if the Selonians are unwilling to accept this sacrifice, they may fare poorly in the battles ahead.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456585" version="1065353216">Gormak and Voss Origins</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456585" version="1065353216">In the beginning, the Gormak were the only species on Voss--semisentient humanoids marked with a strong, though undeveloped, affinity for the Force. However, the history of the Gormak was forever altered several thousand years ago when they were discovered and enslaved by a small group of Sith. 

A minor Jedi contingent of explorers arrived soon after. Bowing to pressure from a group of Gormak elders who had escaped the Sith, the Jedi taught a handful of the tribes the ways of the Force. They had no way of knowing that doing so would alter the path of their natural evolution so that they underwent profound physical and mental changes over the next several generations. The creatures ceased to be Gormak and became something else entirely--the Voss. 

The Jedi preached temperance and defense but the newly formed Voss immediately attacked the Sith who still lurked among the Gormak primitives. The Voss destroyed the Sith, but in the process they were touched by the dark side, further altering their radically sensitive evolutionary path. Later the small group of Jedi explorers disappeared, having gone home or dying to accident or Voss aggression. Whatever the case, the strange happenings on Voss were never recorded in any archive.

Ascending to the top of Voss's tallest peak, the new species turned to its most powerful Force-users for leadership. Myths about their origins began as the newly ordained &quot;Mystics&quot; tried to explain what had happened and eventually it was believed that the Voss had simply always been. In time this myth became the accepted truth, until even the Mystics themselves forgot the real origins of their people.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456587" version="1065353216">Mystic Visions</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456587" version="1065353216">For the Voss, a Mystic's vision is a rare and solemn event. While visions are always believed to serve the greater good of the Voss people, in the short term they can mean great upheaval and suffering. Following the visions of their Mystics, the Voss have waged bloody war on one another, torn down and rebuilt half of Voss-Ka and spent centuries digging underground in search of sacred crystals--but experience has shown that those who ignore visions do so at their peril. The predictions of the Mystics have never been wrong.

For these reasons, a Mystic's vision is treated with great care. No Mystic determines himself how the Voss act upon his vision; instead, the vision is described to the experienced interpreters at the Tower of Prophecy. The interpreters debate its meaning and meditate before they present their analysis, and the Three--or another to whom the vision is directed--act on the interpretation, confident in the knowledge that whatever action is necessary, it is ultimately for the benefit of all Voss.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456588" version="1065353216">The Imperial Attack on Voss</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456588" version="1065353216">When the Empire first learned of Voss--a primitive world with powerful Force-sensitive Mystics--it was quickly marked for conquest. &quot;Ambassadors&quot; sent to the capital reported that Voss-Ka appeared wholly undefended. Soon after, the Imperial General Khypes arrived with a battle cruiser and several army divisions to demand that the Voss surrender.

Before any official communication could be sent to the Voss government, Khypes's battle cruiser exploded. Its escorts were destroyed moments later, whether caught in the cruiser's blast or eliminated through other means. The invasion was over before it had begun.

In the hours that followed, both Imperial and Republic forces scrambled to determine what had happened. No trace of an energy discharge was found, suggesting planetary defenses were not involved. The Empire suspected Republic sabotage or secret Voss weapons. The Republic theorized that the destruction was the result of Sith infighting. The Voss called it destiny.

Regardless, the Empire realized it had underestimated the Voss and hastily recalled its forces, claiming General Khypes was a rogue acting without orders. Soon, the Empire began to attempt more diplomatic overtures to the Voss people.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456591" version="1065353216">The Pilgrimage to the Shrine of Healing</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456591" version="1065353216">Tales of the miraculous powers possessed by the Mystics at the Shrine of Healing have spread across the galaxy, and many offworlders have flocked to Voss in the hopes of being cured of their various ailments and afflictions. Before they can petition the healers, however, those seeking aid must embark on a dangerous and arduous pilgrimage to the shrine's remote location. 

This journey is more than merely symbolic. Facing the trials of the pilgrimage purifies the spirit of the petitioner--an essential requirement, the Voss say, for those seeking aid. Voss healing rituals disperse an affliction across multiple individuals, diluting it until it no longer has any ill effects. If the ritual is performed on one who has not been purified, the Mystics believe there is a chance the malady will instead infect all involved in the ritual, making the necessity of the pilgrimage readily apparent.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456592" version="1065353216">The Three</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456592" version="1065353216">Many outsiders believe that the Voss are directly governed by their Mystics; an understandable mistake, given the Mystics' importance. In fact, the Mystics' visions are first interpreted, then conveyed to the Three--the secular governing body based in Voss-Ka, who base their executive orders upon the visions' interpretations.

The Three are chosen by Mystics after meditation or according to visions, but have little direct contact with the Mystics on a day-to-day basis. Working from the Tower of Prophecy, the Three administer Voss-Ka, make policy decisions and coordinate the endless war against the Gormak. 

Depending on the advice of the Mystics, appointment to the Three can last a lifetime or just hours. The current members of the Three are the calm, authoritative Sonn-Vi; Gunta-Mer, who was chosen by the Mystics only weeks ago; and Nen-Ji, the longest-serving member, who has been part of the Three since childhood.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456593" version="1065353216">For centuries, the Emperor's Voice has delivered the Sith leader's commandments to his servants. In fact, to converse with the Emperor's Voice is to have an audience with the Emperor himself, whose power and consciousness have been placed within the Voice's body.

Although the audible voice never changes, the physical individual who does the speaking has assumed many forms--various accounts describe the Emperor's Voice as anyone from a young human female to an elderly full-blooded Sith male. Regardless of physical appearance, however, the Emperor's Voice can always be identified by its emotionless, precise and controlled manner of speaking. Some have privately described conversations with this entity as extremely disturbing; there is often the sense that the Emperor's Voice is listening to another conversation even when he or she is speaking.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456693" version="1065353216">The spirit healers and dream-walkers of Voss are a strange group, even by Voss standards. Preferring to spend most of their time meditating in the wilderness of the Old Paths instead of in Voss-Ka, these Mystics work on healing the mind rather than the body.

Using the ritual of dream-walking, the Mystics enter their own minds and face their own fears, hopes, loves and rages, seeking spiritual balance and health. Such spirit healers are few, but there is evidence of their existence throughout Voss history, and an archive of their writings is kept for spirit healer initiates in the Shrine of Healing.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456696" version="1065353216">Little is forbidden on Voss, where life is directed by the infallible visions of the Mystics. Yet one ritual, practiced by ancient spirit healers and believed to be powerful enough to restore even the most fractured mind, was locked away within the Shrine of Healing and guarded by a Voss apparition.

The so-called &quot;Forbidden Ritual&quot;--its true name long lost to history--involves dream-walking alongside one of the hated Gormaks. By uniting both Voss and Gormak, it can heal the mind of its &quot;nightmares.&quot;</text>

The Mystics are a wildcard; they must be brought under control before the endgame. Any other opportunities Voss presents--a chance to train operatives against the Force in a controlled environment, a bauble to distract the Republic and Empire, even a base of operations--are secondary.

Follow the plan. Become what they require and make your case. We don't need to make allies; we just need them out of the way while we resolve the matters at hand.

I wish you could be here for the last days, but our &quot;prophecy&quot; must be sealed by sacrifice and we can't risk another layer of deception. Your time as enforcer will be remembered in the codex, and Hunter will be an able successor.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456698" version="1065353216">The Voss do not, as a rule, welcome outsiders. They see themselves as unique in the galaxy, chosen by prophecy, and believe that non-Voss play another role altogether.

The Shining Man--who called himself Albathius upon his arrival--is the only known exception. He was first seen in the plazas of Voss-Ka, haggard and seeking food. No holocam or ship manifest recorded how he came to the planet, and he offered no explanation.

In a matter of days, the Shining Man ingratiated himself with the Voss, living and working among them. To the intelligence services observing, it was clear Albathius was more than he appeared--but by the time they began a detailed investigation, the Shining Man had become part of the culture, participating in Voss rituals and being adopted into a Voss family.

When the Shining Man died in his home, his status was cemented as a near-holy figure. If he had been assassinated, his enemies had made a martyr of him.

If he had chosen death himself, he had made the ultimate commitment to his cover. The only question was &quot;Why?&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456699" version="1065353216">Law and Order on Voss (Smuggler)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456699" version="1065353216">The legal system of Voss can be especially perplexing to offworlders, many of whom are surprised to discover criminal gangs like the Exchange operating openly on the planet. Calls by Republic officials to close down these centers of illicit trade have been met with puzzlement and refusal by the Voss, who see no harm in encouraging free trade between their people and offworlders. 

Crime among Voss is nonexistent, and Voss law is a much simpler affair than the regulations governing Republic and Imperial worlds. Voss laws are established by the Mystics, enforced by the commandos and judged by the adjudicators. This last group was recently formed solely for offworlders, as no Voss citizen would ever violate their rulers' edicts.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456700" version="1065353216">Potential Mystics (Consular)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456700" version="1065353216">Voss Mystics are both born and made. Children who show signs of talent in either prophecy or healing are sent to the Tower of Prophecy for training and study. When these potentials are old enough, they may go on a pilgrimage across Voss where they visit holy sites, fast and meditate on their future roles.

A potential's training does not end until he either performs a great act of healing or experience a vision. If a potential Mystic begins his training but fails to complete it, he is allowed to re-enter Voss society and is referred to as a &quot;lost potential.&quot; Although there is no stigma to failing Mystic training, lost potentials are often left feeling isolated from other Voss due to their long study and experience of the rituals at the Tower of Prophecy. What greater role lost potentials will fulfill in the Voss prophecies is still an unanswered question.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456701" version="1065353216">The Deep Cradle (Consular)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456701" version="1065353216">&quot;All that is Voss comes from Voss,&quot; run the words of an ancient Voss creation myth. According to tradition, the ruin known as the Deep Cradle marks the site where the Voss were born from the substance of the planet itself. Later stories tell of how one Voss returned to the Deep Cradle and drank from the fire at the planet's heart; he knew he would perish, but that his sacrifice was necessary for the greater good. His prophetic dying words are said to have guided the ancient Voss safely through the wilderness, until they discovered the mountain where Voss-Ka now stands.

The altars of the Deep Cradle, meditated upon by potential Mystics, reflect these myths. The Altar of Life celebrates the existence and survival of the Voss despite all odds. The Altar of Death represents the irrevocability of one's actions. Finally, the Altar of Duty stands for both the ability to choose, and the responsibility that comes with choosing correctly.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456702" version="1065353216">Gormak Shamans</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456702" version="1065353216">All Gormak possess a natural affinity for technology, but those who are particularly adept often assume the role of shaman--a position of great respect and responsibility within each tribe. Like their kin, the shamans are fierce warriors driven by the desire to purge their homeworld of both the Voss and outsiders, and much of their knowledge and expertise is focused on devising better ways to kill the enemies of the tribe.

Other Gormak also look to these techno-priests for leadership and guidance--not just in matters of technology, but in their daily lives. In return, a shaman works tirelessly to maximize the value of any and all equipment collected by the tribe, transforming broken junk into tools and machinery to improve the quality of life for the entire group.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456704" version="1065353216">Mystics</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456704" version="1065353216">No Voss are more revered than the Force-sensitive Mystics. Individuals with extraordinary gifts of healing and prophecy, Mystics most often live in seclusion, using their talents to guide their people. 

Mystic visionaries experience prophetic visions, which are carefully studied by interpreters at the Tower of Prophecy before being passed on to the ruling Three; it is said that no Mystic's vision has failed to come true, giving immense weight to any statement by a Mystic visionary. At the Shrine of Healing, Mystic healers use intense meditation and rituals to cure their patients, often of ailments that resist any other treatment.

Becoming a Mystic is a difficult path. After years of training, the most promising potential Mystics go on a pilgrimage across Voss, visiting holy sites in the dangerous Gormak lands and learning from their elders. Even then, not all potentials succeed. The very few who come into their full power as Mystics return triumphantly to Voss-Ka to be recognized by the Three.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456705" version="1065353216">Voss Commandos</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456705" version="1065353216">There is no real distinction between the Voss people and their armed forces. As the Voss are a small, isolated population surrounded by millions of belligerent Gormak, a term of military service as a Voss commando is mandatory for all adults. The commandos defend Voss-Ka and its people against the endless Gormak hordes and act as the city's arbiters for minor disputes. Some Voss commandos choose to continue their service once their terms are over, ascending to the rank of officer.

The simple fact of the Voss's survival in the face of overwhelming Gormak numbers and hostility speaks to the skill of the Voss commandos. They are expert hand-to-hand combatants and peerless scouts, and because every Voss serves, every Voss adult is trained in self-defense. Having seen the Gormak menace firsthand, all adult Voss also understand and accept the sacrifices necessary for their society to survive.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456708" version="1065353216">Jokull</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456708" version="1065353216">Few Gormak show the strength and cunning to become chieftains; to become king takes extraordinary intelligence, ruthlessness and skill. Driven by his burning hatred for the Voss, the veteran warrior Jokull has united the Gormak under his rule and devoted himself to destroying every Voss on the planet. He has sought out ways to improve his weapons, driven his warriors through exhaustive training and ordered his technologists to build dreadful machines of war. His strategies have been surprisingly effective, often catching even the experienced Voss commandos off-guard.

Jokull's single-minded aggression toward the Voss has made the Gormak more dangerous than ever. The Voss commandos are now becoming overstretched as they attempt to defend Voss-Ka. If Jokull's campaign of violence cannot be stopped, it is conceivable that he may soon break through to Voss-Ka and burn it to the ground.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456710" version="1065353216">Cultured, diplomatic and charming, Darth Serevin is as concerned with appearance and manners as he is with seeking power. He once destroyed a former apprentice, not for his clumsy scheming and attempts at betrayal, but for insulting one of Serevin's dinner guests. For these reasons, when the Empire was still smoothing over its short-lived attempt at invading Voss and a diplomatic envoy of immense skill was called for, Darth Serevin's poise and experience made him the ideal choice.

Over his long tenure on Voss, Darth Serevin has developed a liking for Voss art and architecture; he recently sent orders for his own lodgings on Dromund Kaas to be redecorated accordingly. He has also seen the value of the Voss people to the Empire; gaining an army of Voss commandos and Mystics would make the Empire unstoppable, and Darth Serevin is intent on seeing this happen.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456717" version="1065353216">Many Republic visitors to Voss mistake Ambassador Jannik for one of his aides. Young and enthusiastic, the ambassador is determined to stand as a symbol of Republic integrity in Voss-Ka against the scheming of the Empire--but he's found it an uphill struggle. Ambassador Jannik has frequently clashed with the Empire's Sith diplomats, and is struggling to find a way to counter their smooth charm. 

As part of his attempts to understand the Voss, Ambassador Jannik has accumulated a small library of Voss books and plays, and even converted to a traditional Voss diet. The Voss appear to view his efforts as merely more &quot;outsider strangeness,&quot; but Ambassador Jannik has also commented that he now prefers Voss food to the supplies sent by the Republic.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456726" version="1065353216">A Voss Mystic who exiled himself rather than taint his people with his unpopular and heretical ideas, Madaga-Ru lives as a hermit in the dangerous wilds outside the city of Voss-Ka. If asked, he admits to preferring this way of life over the false pretenses of his people's civilization; Madaga-Ru judges his fellow Voss as living in denial and only &quot;seeing&quot; what they want to see.

Despite this disapproval of his culture, Madaga-Ru remains a true believer in the fundamental Voss way of life--a way of balance, simplicity and faith in the visions of the Mystics. Those who refuse to respect Mystic philosophy or deliberately break Voss law receive Madaga-Ru's stern admonishment.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456727" version="1065353216">Prior to his assignment to Voss, Methias Yoran was the Imperial Diplomatic Service's golden boy, having served with distinction through the better part of his life. Yoran was directly involved with the negotiations that led to the Chiss Ascendancy's alliance with the Empire, and proved time and again that the Diplomatic Service was a worthwhile investment of resources. Over the years, he has personally accepted the fealty of more than thirty worlds.

His more recent duties, however, have strained his patience and his abilities. In all his encounters with strange and alien cultures, he has never met a more inscrutable, evasive or infuriatingly untouchable species than the Voss.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456729" version="1065353216">Dokath-Ra (Bounty Hunter)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456729" version="1065353216">In all his years, the Voss Mystic Dokath-Ra has never once felt the stirrings of prophecy. His vision has been firmly grounded in the real world--but that isn't to say that he is blind. Decades of mending the wounded and witnessing the horrors of his people's never-ending war with the Gormak have disillusioned Dokath-Ra, causing him to question the wisdom of his brothers and sisters sitting high on the mountain of Voss-Ka.

Dokath-Ra does not vocalize these concerns, but they weigh heavily on his mind as he enters his later years. Only the growing presence of outsiders on Voss and the wonders of the greater galaxy stir a hope for change inside him.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456731" version="1065353216">Born to the Kuat Sector's influential Redrish family, Thelonia left her privileged life behind during the Great War to assist with relief efforts in the Outer Rim. She served for several years as an aid worker, but it was during one of these relief missions that she became trapped on Lan Barell by an Imperial invasion. Witnessing bloodshed firsthand stirred something in Thelonia, and she laid down her medkit and picked up a weapon.

Despite her youth and inexperience, Thelonia's natural charm, selflessness and bravery propelled her into a leadership position in the resistance movement seeking to take back Lan Barell. That world would only be the first of many she would unite and liberate during the course of the war. Thelonia's efforts were recognized by the Republic after the Treaty of Coruscant and she was awarded the Mark of Victory and the rank of general in the Republic Army.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456733" version="1065353216">Widely regarded as one of the greatest Sith sorcerers in the Empire, the enigmatic Lord Fulminiss is a master of the dark side's most arcane and lethal aspects. The grotesque Harrower assassins are his most famous creation, but legend has it he once summoned a raging storm of pure Force energy that disintegrated a rebellious city of natives in the Imperial-conquered Jabiim system. 

Lord Fulminiss is a respected expert on the topic of mass extermination, and at the Emperor's request, he has performed extensive research into new ways of eliminating planetary populations. More than one Dark Council member has paid handsomely to obtain a record of Lord Fulminiss's work for his or her private perusal.</text>

Although her triumphs are the stuff of legends, Tala-Reh's history has also been marked by personal tragedy. Her devoted husband, a fellow Voss commando, was killed battling the Gormak. She has mourned this loss for years by quietly reciting a poem composed in her husband's honor every day at sunrise and sunset.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456742" version="1065353216">Gaden-Ko (Consular)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456742" version="1065353216">Gaden-Ko is the son of a sculptor and a former Voss commando who was maimed by the Gormak when Gaden-Ko was small. As is Voss custom, he was raised by his grandfather--Dajan-Ko--who soon noticed the young Gaden-Ko's uncanny intuition. This insight allowed him to aid Voss commandos by predicting where Gormak patrols would be. Thus marked as a potential Mystic visionary, he has spent years at the Tower of Prophecy studying and preparing to go on his pilgrimage.

Gaden-Ko's generation is the first to grow up in a Voss-Ka where alien outsiders are a common sight. He has always had an interest in these foreigners, even developing a friendship with the Republic ambassador. Perhaps because of these outside influences, Gaden-Ko is seen to be rather impulsive and impatient compared to other Voss.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456745" version="1065353216">Jela Reneke is Rogun the Butcher's right-hand agent on Voss, a coolly predatory businesswoman with the killer instincts of a firaxan shark. It was Jela who convinced the hostile and reclusive Gormak to form a mutually beneficial economic arrangement selling their hideous tech-beasts on the open galactic market. So respected is Jela by her crime lord employer that she routinely skims ten percent off Rogun's profits without fear of reprisal.

Jela's romantic relationship with her second-in-command, a human nicknamed &quot;Gormak Zak,&quot; soured when Zak's interest in the natives expanded beyond economic exploitation. She has never been the type to let sentiment interfere with good business.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456746" version="1065353216">Lokir-Ka appears to be the perfect Voss citizen. He obeys laws, respects the Mystics and has followed the career path his government laid out for him based on his charm, intelligence and gift for outsider languages. However, this young diplomat conceals a barely-suppressed wanderlust and unseemly fascination with foreign cultures that would shock his peers.

It never occurs to Lokir-Ka to act on his fantasies of exploring the greater galaxy, befriending alien species and perhaps even telling someone &quot;no&quot; once in a while. Such is the life of a dutiful diplomat. After years of working with Republic and Imperial ambassadors trained in polite doublespeak, Lokir-Ka finds the blunt statements of underworld gangsters uniquely appealing.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456748" version="1065353216">Lord Torius is a top Sith diplomat who fancies himself a clever schemer worthy of the title &quot;Darth.&quot; He takes great pleasure in flustering the Republic's representatives when they meet with the Voss and seems determined to secure the planet as an Imperial holding by any means necessary. The death of a Republic negotiator several months ago, while officially attributed to a Gormak attack, was almost certainly a murder orchestrated by Torius.

Intelligence indicates that Lord Torius maintains no close associates, seeking to prove his intellectual superiority without anyone else around to take the credit for it. He spends his private time on Voss alternating between long periods of deep thought and sudden bursts of text-entry into his encrypted datapad.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456749" version="1065353216">Senator Evran is one of the most influential Senators in the entire Republic and a close personal friend of Supreme Chancellor Janarus. Evran's cleverness and talent for vocal persuasion have earned him the affectionate moniker &quot;Coruscant's aurodium voice.&quot; Privately, General Garza refers to him by a different nickname: &quot;the armchair general.&quot;

Evran is obsessed with the Voss Mystics' ability to see the future and he believes an alliance with the Voss will win the war. To this end, he has used his influence to keep a large contingent of Republic soldiers garrisoned at the space station orbiting Voss, despite the desperate need for troops elsewhere. In Senator Evran's scenario, his Republic forces will save the day when the Empire inevitably strikes at Voss, and thus win over the Voss people.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456750" version="1065353216">Fort Salvo</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456750" version="1065353216">Nicknamed by the soldiers who first erected the base, Fort Salvo is the Republic's main artillery and munitions outpost on Ilum. Fort Salvo's gunners are some of the best in the galaxy, and have claimed dozens of Imperial troop carriers; they train by shooting down stray meteorites. The installation of a protective ray shield offended Fort Salvo's more maverick gunners, who saw it as impugning their ability to handle incoming hostiles.

As the Empire presses the Republic forces harder on Ilum, Fort Salvo has become an increasingly important position. Members of the Republic's alien coalition have begun transferring forces there in earnest; this also allows them to claim their share of munitions before anyone else.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456752" version="1065353216">The Ilum Temple</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456752" version="1065353216">In the distant past, when the Jedi Order was first venturing into the galaxy, the order sought to establish a new home and training grounds on the planet Ilum. These ancient Jedi built a new Jedi Temple above Ilum's network of crystal caverns, and while the planet's climate was far from idyllic, its isolation and supply of lightsaber crystals made it an ideal place for schooling Padawans.

Careful to protect Ilum against the darkness that had threatened them on Tython, the ancient Jedi kept the hyperspace routes to Ilum secret from the rest of the Republic. The preferred means of learning the route required Force sensitivity and became the first trial of many an aspiring Jedi. But warfare with the Sith under the fallen Jedi Exar Kun led to the destruction of the training grounds, and in the centuries since, Ilum has been home to only a select few.

The temple became a place for young Jedi to travel and build their lightsabers, and where they might meditate in silence. It was a place of beauty and tranquility and crystalline perfection.

Until today.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456755" version="1065353216">Ilum Crystals</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456755" version="1065353216">The Adegan lightsaber crystals of Ilum were originally discovered by ancient Jedi, who made pilgrimages to Ilum to study and meditate on the Force amid Ilum's harsh wintry environs and to select the Force-resonant crystals for their lightsabers.
	
But while it has long been believed that Adegan crystals had the potential for other uses, serious research into the subject was not pursued until the outbreak of the latest war with the Sith Empire. The Empire and the Republic have both sent teams to Ilum to extract the crystals and discover their military applications--most notably, the potential for stealth technology of unprecedented effectiveness.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456757" version="1065353216">Pilgrimages to Ilum</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456757" version="1065353216">Distant, frozen and dangerous, Ilum has nonetheless attracted Jedi visitors for centuries. The vast crystal caves beneath Ilum's surface draw those seeking to improve their weapons, meditate in seclusion or test themselves against the natural hazards there.

One pilgrimage to Ilum nearly ended in disaster when Master Seta-Le, trekking through Ilum's mountains to a meditation site, fell through a patch of ice into a cavern. Trapped and with her lightsaber broken in the fall, she eventually managed to apply the lightsaber's components to a nearby crystal formation. The resulting scattered beam melted through the ice wall of the cavern, allowing Master Seta-Le to escape. The complex, fragile ice formations created from the beam have become another point of interest on Ilum for Jedi pilgrims.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456758" version="1065353216">Stealth Technology and Warfare</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456758" version="1065353216">Stealth field generators allow individuals to effectively become invisible and have been in common use for centuries, most often seen in modern times in the possession of professional spies and underworld figures. Invisibility is also possible on a larger scale; occasionally private starships employ cloaking devices, but the costs involved mean they are reserved for the very rich, or those willing to seize such devices by force. 
	
Despite the obvious advantages, in wartime cloaked ships and individuals are usually only deployed for small, covert operations. Cloaking an entire division or fleet would not be practical. But periodically, researchers or military leaders obsessed with the possibilities attempt to develop technology to allow mass-cloaking, knowing it would change the face of warfare forever. Given the amplification properties discovered in Ilum crystals, perhaps the time for change has finally come.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456761" version="1065353216">The Battle for Ilum</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456761" version="1065353216">To the Jedi, Ilum is a sacred world invaded and ravaged. To the Empire, it represents vital resources and the chance for a powerful symbolic victory. After learning of the value of Ilum's crystals in the years after the Sacking of Coruscant, the Empire sent a small group of Sith to investigate the planet. With only a handful of Jedi scattered across the ice plains, the Sith were able to avoid or defeat their foes and begin quietly harvesting Ilum's crystals. 
	
During the fighting on Corellia, Republic SIS operatives recovered evidence of the Empire's plans to use these crystals and develop stealth technology on an unprecedented scale. The Republic gathered its fleets and allies--both old and new--and raced in defense of Ilum. The aid of the Jedi has allowed the Republic to establish strong bases, but the Empire is determined not to lose such a valuable world. The battle for Ilum promises to be long and bloody.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456765" version="1065353216">The Republic's Alien Allies</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456765" version="1065353216">The renewed war with the Empire and the fight for Corellia brought the Republic to the brink, prompting it to call on a variety of allies and member worlds. Now the battle on Ilum and the chance the Empire may gain the massive advantage of a stealth fleet have reaffirmed the need for wide support. Duros, Talz, Ongree and Wookiee shock troops have all lent their soldiers, munitions and fleets to the fight. More unusual is the presence of Kaleesh mercenaries; these masked, highly skilled warriors have come to the fiercest battleground in the galaxy seeking honor and glory.

Ordinarily, keeping such diverse forces working together would be a challenge. But the harsh conditions on Ilum, the furious onslaught from the Empire and the knowledge of the consequences of defeat have served to unify the Republic's forces and kept disagreements to a minimum.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456766" version="1065353216">Deep-Miners</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456766" version="1065353216">Deep-miner technology has been in development for over a decade. These exceptionally powerful drilling devices were originally conceived by the Imperial machinist Jelven Donn, who was investigating ways to keep mining worlds profitable. Able to drill down to previously unreachable depths, deep-miners would be able to reach resources long thought depleted--in theory. However, Jelven Donn was never able to solve the problem of the deep-miners' power consumption, and lost half a dozen units to overloaded batteries.

With the discovery of Ilum and its unique crystal deposits, Jelven Donn realized that the amplifying capabilities of Adegan crystals could make deep-miner power supplies a viable prospect at last. Deep-miners have since become a staple of Imperial mining efforts on Ilum. However, their deployment close to Ilum's core has concerned some Imperial scientists, who have picked up recent fluctuations in seismic activity.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456768" version="1065353216">Kaleesh Mercenaries</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456768" version="1065353216">The Kaleesh as a species are known for their strong warrior culture, grounded in a religious belief that great deeds in battle place one on the path to godhood after death. It is not typical, therefore, for Kaleesh to sell themselves as mercenaries, as doing so is often viewed as dishonorable.

With the outbreak of the latest war between the Republic and Empire, however, mercenary work has become too plentiful for the Kaleesh to ignore. Many clans of Kaleesh have formed armies-for-hire, throwing their lot in with the alien-friendly Republic--and charging a high price. Still, the Republic's way of waging war leaves little room for the valiant acts of heroism that form the backbone of Kaleesh religion, and it seems likely that should the Empire move beyond its alien prejudices, the Kaleesh might be persuaded to switch sides.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456769" version="1065353216">Darth Malgus has long been a paradox to his fellow Sith: a staunch proponent of the Empire's superiority who also questions some of its oldest values. Born under the name &quot;Veradun&quot; in the years before the Empire's return, Malgus distinguished himself during the war as a warrior and general. He was eventually entrusted with securing the Empire's interests on distant worlds, where he encountered the soldiers of many alien cultures and found them worthy of respect.

As Malgus grew in prominence, fighting at the Battle of Alderaan and later during the Sacking of Coruscant, his travels and alliances with aliens--including a relationship with his Twi'lek slave-- marked him as an unorthodox figure. Caring nothing for the power plays common to Sith, Darth Malgus has spent the last few years strengthening his ties to alien groups. He has often claimed that the Empire's ancient prejudices against aliens and constant infighting are weaknesses; to be victorious, Malgus says, the Empire must change.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456771" version="1065353216">One of the senior members of the Jedi Council, Master Jaric Kaedan was born in the Outer Rim and, although he wasn't discovered by the Jedi until he was twelve, quickly rose in prominence. During the war, Master Jaric Kaedan joined the Republic forces fighting on the front lines and was involved in several notable military actions, including the battles on Rhen Var and the capture of the Dread Masters. He remains the council member with the closest ties to the Republic military.

To his students, Master Jaric Kaedan is a harsh taskmaster, driven by the knowledge that his lessons may one day save their lives. He believes that the greatest threats to a Jedi can come from within, and encourages his students to master themselves before they seek mastery over a lightsaber. To the Sith, he is known as a formidable enemy, firm in his conviction that there can never be peace while the Empire still exists.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456773" version="1065353216">Admiral Shai has seen this all before: warfare, followed by escalation, followed by more warfare, followed by more escalation. While he has come to Ilum commanding the Republic's research forces to take advantage of the power of the Adegan crystals, what he really wants is an end to the war and the endless parade of new weapons it fosters.
	
Shai believes that the conflict between the Empire and the Republic can only end one way at the current rate--with both sides eventually developing the technology to annihilate one another and destroy the galaxy. On Ilum, he hopes to break the cycle.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456774" version="1065353216">Grand Moff Regus</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456774" version="1065353216">Grand Moff Regus has spent much of his career overshadowed by the reputation and career of his predecessor, Grand Moff Kilran. But in the wake of Kilran's death, Regus has found himself promoted to the limelight, at the head of the Empire's most crucial military operation since the Sacking of Coruscant.

A patriot and a traditionalist, Grand Moff Regus believes in decisive, precision strikes that debilitate and demoralize the enemy--and in an Empire served by men of pure vision and pure bloodline. He is old enough to remember a time before the Empire returned to the galaxy, before Imperials used aliens as anything other than slaves, and he was raised on stories of ancient Imperial glory.

The legends that endure, Regus knows, are of battles fought and won by noble Sith and Imperial soldiers from well-established families with an unquestioned loyalty--loyalty not to the latest rising Dark Council member, but to the Emperor himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456775" version="1065353216">Darth Arho</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456775" version="1065353216">Described by his followers as a driven man and called a ruthless fanatic by his foes, Darth Arho has come to Ilum for one reason--to crush the Republic. His tenure on the Dark Council has been brief but hawkish, according to SIS reports--he appears to be a successor to the warlike Darth Vengean, whose death resulted in significant internal strife among the Sith. The recent blows struck against the Emperor have only driven Darth Arho to push harder for the Republic's utter extermination. 

The other members of the Dark Council have been able to channel Darth Arho's ruthless, single-minded dedication, wielding him like a weapon, and on Ilum he has proven a capable leader. However, his willingness to casually sacrifice the lives of Imperial soldiers and lesser Sith have become impossible to ignore. If there is anything less than a total, unquestionable victory on Ilum, Darth Arho may face the Dark Council's wrath.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="456776" version="1065353216">Supreme Commander Rans</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="456776" version="1065353216">In some ways, Supreme Commander Rans is a soldier from another time. He grew up in the peaceful years before the Sith Empire's return, where the greatest threats he faced were border skirmishes with scattered Mandalorian clans. Nevertheless, Rans proved to be a quick-thinking and heroic soldier; as he ascended the ranks, his looks and easy charm also made him a media darling and helped him to build up the Republic military to new and impressive standards.

Although a clever strategist and liked by his men, Rans was outplayed by the Sith Empire in the later days of the war. Underestimating the Imperial threat, he pushed to move troops off Coruscant and onto the Imperial border not long before the planet was sacked. Rans has more than learned from his mistake, however. No one in the Republic military is more dedicated to driving back the Empire and restoring the glory days of the Republic.</text>

The Great Hyperspace War was a turning point for civilization. For the first time, the galaxy itself was imperiled, and every living being put at risk. History nearly ended. And why?

Because the Jedi and the Sith--ordinary people with extraordinary might--went too far, and there was nothing anyone could do to stop them.

We cannot change the nature of ordinary people. But we can control them.

We have assembled the best men and women of our generation, individuals with the power and the will to effect change. Some of you see yourselves as rivals elsewhere, but here we are partners.

Our goal is not to conquer or to punish, but to preserve civilization as we know it. We will work in secret, so that no one may fear us. We will conceal the Sith from the Jedi, and the Jedi from the Sith so long as we can, and we will let them command the world that they see.

But they will see only what we let them see.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460753" version="1065353216">The Empire will be victorious over the Republic; this is unquestioned. But to Darth Malgus, victory should have come with the Sacking of Coruscant. Now, he believes, the obscure designs of the Sith Emperor, a cultural disdain for aliens and infighting within the Sith have all left the Empire incapable of winning the war. 

With his mind broadened--or tainted--by years of travel and study among alien cultures, Malgus carefully cultivated the opinions of likeminded Sith leaders for years. Upon the recent disappearance of the Emperor, he seized the opportunity to create a new Empire--one that embraces alien cultures and is strengthened by diversity. All allies of the new Empire will be considered equal citizens, guided by Imperial discipline and values. Personal strength and accomplishment, not genetics, will determine an Imperial's fate.

Malgus is aware that many will not share his vision. But with a stealth armada at his command and the Emperor's space station as his base, he is prepared to prove the power of his new Empire to all dissenters.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="460756" version="1065353216">The Emperor's Space Station</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460756" version="1065353216">The Emperor's space station is as much temple as fortress. Built by the Empire's finest engineers--many of whom never left their creation--the station is a blend of modern and incredibly ancient technology. The cloaking device which keeps the station invisible uses Gree technology, while the station's power core and security features are Rakata in design.

The station is vast, comprising an unknown number of decks and chambers. Dozens of rooms store artifacts the Emperor gathered over the centuries, while prisoners whose identities are long forgotten float in stasis chambers. Traditionally, the privileged few who had audiences on the station were brought there by the Emperor's servants, with no memories of the journey.

In the hands of Darth Malgus, the space station has become a new and terrible weapon--but one with many secrets yet to be unlocked. Malgus and his servants have much to learn about their headquarters and its full capabilities.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460757" version="1065353216">Led by the famed Arkis Wode, the Schism Collective is a group of Anomid technological savants. Although its members are clearly brilliant, the Schism Collective's experiments have been condemned as dangerous or even barbaric by Republic observers, and anyone affiliated with the collective is barred from certain systems in Republic space.

The Schism Collective's skills drew the attention of Darth Malgus, who patiently earned its members' trust with gifts of technology and test subjects. The collective's technologists have since performed many important services for Malgus, such as incorporating the technology of the ancient Foundry into the Emperor's captured space station. They have also augmented the weaponry used by Malgus's forces with Rakata devices and perfected the production of his stealth fleet. Malgus holds up the Schism Collective as an example of alien ingenuity that the old Empire was foolish to reject.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460758" version="1065353216">The Anomid reputation for technological expertise is well founded and goes back thousands of years. In partnership with the Ithorians, the Anomids developed sophisticated agricultural machines to feed their people--technology they now readily share with worlds left barren by the Great War. They have also contributed greatly to medical and cybernetics research. 

Many Anomids are devoted pacifists; their Central Council routinely refuses any official requests to work in Republic weapons development. However, individual Anomids and fringe groups sometimes offer their services to mercenary groups, pirates or Hutts, either wishing to test their skills or simply for credits. Anomid-modified weapons are, therefore, both impressive and extremely rare. One particular rifle recently sold on Nar Shaddaa's black market for a small fortune.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460760" version="1065353216">This HK-series assassin droid achieved infamy just before the Jedi Civil War. Although outwardly resembling a Systech Corporation unit, he was actually built by Darth Revan as a method of silencing political opponents. HK-47 has had many masters besides Revan, as well--corporate figures, crime lords, Hutts and Mandalorians--who have tried to harness his assassination protocols, usually with disastrous results.

Three centuries ago, after being found and repaired by the Jedi Exile, HK-47 helped defeat the Sith Triumvirate. After the fighting ended, he was kept in trust by the re-formed Jedi Order, much to his dismay; with the galaxy still in turmoil, the Jedi were concerned that HK-47 would start &quot;helpfully&quot; removing troublesome individuals. Then, during routine maintenance, an engineer accidentally activated an unknown command in HK-47's systems. Soon after, the droid disappeared from Jedi custody and left for deep space.

The Jedi's records claim that HK-47 has been destroyed and rebuilt several times since his creation. Darth Malgus's agents are said to have recently recovered HK-47's components from a mysterious facility built into an asteroid. Now reassembled and upgraded, HK-47 has become one of Darth Malgus's most formidable weapons.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460763" version="1065353216">The world of Malachor Five was host to a Sith academy before its destruction three centuries ago, but the Jedi have long suspected that Sith ruins are scattered on other planets and moons across the Malachor system. Several decades ago, the Jedi Order's six most promising students obtained permission to explore Malachor Three. Their arrival roused the spirit of Terrak Morrhage, a Sith Lord entombed on the planet.

Yuon Par and Duras Fain succumbed to the spirit's influence first, giving in to their suppressed passion for each other. Appalled, Eriz Vossan and Cin Tykan began to suffer terrifying nightmares and paranoia. Slowly the expedition members turned on each other, only coming to their senses when the dark creatures of Malachor Three--stirred by Terrak Morrhage's anger--rose up against them. 

The tactician Sidonie Garen formulated a plan, but an error of judgment sent the expedition into dangerous terrain. The youngest Jedi, Parkanas Tark, was trapped trying to save Eriz Vossan, and was left behind when the others finally escaped. Malachor Three is now forbidden to explorers; the expedition members have not spoken in many years.</text>

Besieged by the dark spirit of the Sith Lord interred there, most of the expedition--Yuon Par, Duras Fain, Sidonie Garen, Eriz Vossan and Cin Tykan--managed to flee, but the youngest member, Parkanas Tark, was left behind. 

Believed dead by his comrades, Parkanas nevertheless survived--though he was left horribly scarred by the dark creatures that dwelled on the planet. Nothing was left in him but anger and a longing for revenge. Taking the name Vivicar, he managed to recover the secrets of the dark plague once created by the Sith Lord Terrak Morrhage, and turned it against the Jedi who had been his friends. Now, Vivicar seeks not only personal vengeance, but the annihilation of the Jedi Order that left him to die so long ago.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460769" version="1065353216">The Rift Alliance is a group of powerful worlds united by their shared protests at Republic &quot;incompetence&quot; and their threat to secede. Losing any one of these planets would be a catastrophe for the Republic; losing all of them could cause the Republic's collapse.

Rift Alliance member Alauni represents Saleucami, the Republic's most powerful trade hub in the Outer Rim, while Aeten Two--Diab Duin's world--produces vital ores and crystals for Republic fleet construction. As tensions with the Empire rise, supplies of the healing fluid kolto from Manaan--Shuuru's world--have become indispensible. The planet Erigorm, represented by Augin Blaesus, has recorded and administrated the Republic's finances for centuries; its secession could destroy the Republic's financial markets.

Not all members of the Rift Alliance are hostile toward the Republic, however. Tai Cordan, a member of Balmorra's exiled government, claims to be seeking powerful allies to help his home. Senator Tobas Grell and his daughter Nadia, newcomers representing the planet Sarkhai, appear to have joined out of curiosity.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460771" version="1065353216">Sarkhai is a small planet in the Mid Rim, notable for its dense, relentless forests. Once cleared, a stretch of Sarkhai's gnarled undergrowth can grow back in days, and its foliage hides some of the most vicious wildlife in the sector. As a result, Sarkhai went unexplored for millennia; its indigenous people joined the Republic less than a decade ago.

Surrounded by this hostile environment, the Sarkhai people developed impressive shielding technology to protect themselves and their cities. Safe zones and paths are created with networks of force fields. Republic scientists have now begun incorporating Sarkhai characteristics into new shield designs.

The Sarkhai tradition of face-painting also comes from the dangers of the Sarkhai homeworld. Originally a method of frightening predators, for modern Sarkhai face-painting has become a respected part of their culture. The pattern Nadia Grell wears is an old design called &quot;to see faithfully.&quot;</text>

Surrounded by new species and strange cultures, Nadia is eager to experience everything she can. She has become interested in the intricacies of galactic diplomacy while traveling alongside her father, and often acts as his assistant during talks.

As she revealed on Attis Station, Nadia is also strong in the Force; unusually strong, in fact. As Force sensitives are relatively unknown on Sarkhai, Nadia's untrained powers left her shunned and feared by her own people. Senator Grell's decision to take her with him when he left Sarkhai was motivated by the hope of finding others like her in the Republic, and perhaps discovering some way for her to control her incredible talents.

Infants of all species taken before the Sith Emperor, the children are infused with the Emperor's strength, sharing some measure of his thoughts and power for the rest of their lives. They become the Emperor's eyes and ears, and--should the Emperor focus his presence upon them--his puppets. It is believed that the children have some way to hide their dark presence from Jedi senses, meaning they can exist undetected within the Republic.

The position of the Children of the Emperor within the Sith hierarchy is unclear. Few Sith appear to even know of their existence, and Sith who investigate rumors of the children have been known to disappear without a trace. Since the Emperor would not go to such elaborate lengths simply to create infiltrators in the Republic, the true purpose behind the children remains a mystery.</text>

Kira was born in Imperial space and raised at Korriban's Sith Academy. She escaped her deadly training while still a child and fled to Hutt Space before being taken in by Master Bela Kiwiiks.

Kira kept her past a secret out of fear of being shunned by her adopted Jedi family--or worse, being imprisoned for her connection to the Sith. Although she claims to be a loyal servant of the light side, the fact remains that good Jedi do not keep such secrets from their allies.</text>

The devious Sith scientist used his extraordinary knowledge and the Republic's vast resources to develop a series of powerful weapons that could turn the tide of any future war. What the Republic did not realize is that these weapons could be combined into a far more deadly device.

Before his death, Tarnis transmitted the complete schematics of all his work to his father, legendary Sith Lord Darth Angral. Copies of these records were recovered on Ord Mantell under the code name &quot;Desolator,&quot; along with an affectionate series of messages between father and son. Whatever their evils, the Sith feel family bonds as acutely as anyone.</text>

His greatest achievement as a Jedi to date was when he dueled Sith Lord Darth Sajar to a draw--and then convinced the enemy to abandon the path of darkness and train as a Jedi.

Although most Padawans assume Master Braga developed his opposition to warfare during the Great War, it began much earlier. His first mission as a young Jedi was to intervene in a violent civil conflict on the planet Duro. Master Braga saw firsthand the horrors that occur when people take up arms against their own kind, and it forever changed his outlook.</text>

Even the most powerful members of the Dark Council avoid offending the man bearing the title &quot;the Emperor's Wrath.&quot;

Lord Scourge has dutifully served the Empire for over three hundred years, his life unnaturally prolonged by perverse technology and his master's dark side powers. Centuries spent watching his fellow Sith Lords rise and fall has given Lord Scourge a unique perspective on people. He can analyze someone's flaws after only brief observation, and freely shares his perceptions (whether they're wanted or not).

The Emperor's desire is not destruction for its own sake, however. He is not a nihilist. The Emperor intends to feed on the galaxy's extinction and draw that energy into himself, giving him true immortality--and a godlike mastery of the Force.

The Jedi can only speculate on what the Emperor will do if his plan succeeds. Does he intend to preserve any followers, or live on alone? With such unlimited power, could he plant the seeds of life and raise a new galaxy from the old one's ashes?</text>

His corrupting influence is so complete that none can stand in his presence without succumbing to fear, anger and hatred. The Emperor can wither and ruin even the strongest Jedi's connection to the light side.

Jedi Master Tol Braga's strike team was not the first group to succumb to the Sith leader's oppressive influence. Hundreds of years ago, the Jedi Revan and Malak discovered Dromund Kaas and confronted the Emperor. They fell to the dark side and returned to Republic space as Sith Lords. Since then, dozens more Jedi have followed the same path into evil.</text>

The man literally cheated death by freezing himself in carbonite for over a decade--but before he entered this self-imposed hibernation, he orchestrated a long con on the galaxy's fortune seekers.

Nok spread the rumor that his fabled wealth had been lost in deep space, and set the underworld's greedier denizens to work hunting down the technology needed to secure his daughter's birthright as royal ruler of the planet Dubrillion. Whatever else can be said about Nok Drayen, his cunning, patience and planning are second to none.</text>

Considering her upbringing as a violent gangster's child, it's a wonder Risha turned out remotely normal. Wise and experienced beyond her years, she has led an adventurous life containing some extremely dark chapters.

Despite her biting sarcasm and general selfishness, one can never shake the feeling that Risha would be a better person if only she knew how. Years spent among the galaxy's dregs have fostered layers of personal self-defense mechanisms and a cynical shell around her. Only the most persistent friend has any hope of meeting the &quot;real&quot; Risha hiding beneath the surface.

It rapidly became a favorite destination for smugglers, black market merchants and other outlaws. Of all the galaxy's seedy spaceports, only Port Nowhere offered true freedom.

For years, Port Nowhere traveled between Hutt Space, the Outer Rim and the Core Worlds. It stopped in neutral sectors and broadcasted its coordinates on coded HoloNet frequencies. Criminals converged on the station and conducted business before it jumped back to hyperspace, always remaining one step ahead of the law.

Recently, however, Port Nowhere suffered a major hyperdrive malfunction that left it stranded. When or whether the station shall resume its former mobility remains a mystery.</text>

There are never enough vessels to both engage the enemy and defend critical star systems. Thus, despite its firm commitment to law and order, the Republic is not above sanctioning outlaw starship captains to take up arms against the Empire.

The laws governing Republic privateers are kept deliberately simple in acknowledgement of the personality types who accept such work. First, no attacks on civilian transports or population centers are permitted. Second, Republic privateers are expressly forbidden to engage in criminal acts like slavery and murder. Armed robbery of Imperial military vessels and the smuggling of contraband goods pillaged from the enemy are left in an undefined moral gray area, however.</text>

He started his career as a brutal criminal slaver on the Outer Rim before becoming an Imperial privateer. His underworld experience made him an especially effective &quot;dirty fighter,&quot; but also antagonized the Imperial Navy's aristocratic officers who preferred to conduct war according to accepted strategies.

The Voidwolf cemented his position with the Empire by capturing a Jedi vessel filled with Force-sensitive children. He personally led the boarding party that killed the Jedi defenders and took the young Padawans-to-be prisoner. When he delivered this &quot;gift&quot; to the Sith on Korriban for training, they promoted him from independent privateer all the way to the rank of Navy commander.</text>

They see him as pirate scum promoted far above his station--and he has never argued with that assessment. The Voidwolf's interest in the Empire has always been its profit potential.

The Voidwolf recruited Imperial sleeper agent Darmas Pollaran and corrupt Republic Senator Bevera Dodonna to organize the galaxy's smugglers, gangsters and pirates into his personal mercenary fleet. Their goal is to strike the Republic's shipyards and loot everything that isn't nailed down. With these stolen resources, the Voidwolf intends to plunder the Core Worlds while the Republic and Empire battle on Corellia.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460802" version="1065353216">The traitorous Commander Tavus was granted a Harrower-class dreadnought by the Imperial Navy to serve as his flagship. The vessel's name was selected by Tavus himself, perhaps alluding to his personal motivations for abandoning the Republic. As his fellow Havoc Squad conspirators were systematically eliminated, Tavus summoned his remaining forces to the flagship to regroup.

Although capable of serving in a variety of roles, Harrower-class vessels are most often seen acting as the backbone of Imperial fleets. For the Empire to put a Harrower into the hands of Tavus suggests an enormous faith in the rogue commander--and ambitious plans for the future.</text>

Combined with a unique targeting array using the same technology as hyperwave relays, the Gauntlet can select and destroy enemy starships while they are still traveling through hyperspace.

A single shot from the Gauntlet can annihilate even the largest Republic dreadnought, giving the Empire a crushingly decisive advantage in the war. It is worth noting that unlike many superweapons--which seem designed to inflict casualties on large populations--the Gauntlet is that rare device that permits highly-selective targeting. It is possible to fire the Gauntlet without ever endangering civilians.</text>

These highly trained specialists break through the defenses of enemy bunkers and command posts, eliminate all hostiles within and either secure the locations for Republic use or destroy them so the Empire can't return.

&quot;Killed in Action&quot; rates for these missions frequently exceed thirty percent, and the Safecrackers maintain a memorial space at their barracks for members lost in the line of duty. Indeed, after every successful mission the men and women of the Safecrackers return to the memorial in squad formation and quietly salute their fallen comrades.</text>

Rakton passionately believes in the Empire's ideals, confident he is fighting a war of enlightenment that will bring order to the corrupt and inferior Galactic Republic. He is well regarded by both peers and subordinates as an outstanding leader.

Despite the calm he projects as a commander, Rakton is still a soldier at heart--a killer in the trenches who has never shied away from getting his hands dirty. However, the general always reserves his warrior's rage for enemy soldiers. Men under his command who harm civilians are always harshly disciplined.</text>

Until the recent events involving Havoc Squad, the last recipient had been General Garza during her time as a captain in the Republic Special Forces.

Those who receive this honor are frequently being groomed for high-level positions in the military bureaucracy. Previous honorees have gone on to become top leaders in High Command, trusted to oversee the Republic's valiant soldiers with full understanding of the sacrifices needed--and what it takes to win a war.</text>

Like many ancient Sith, his name is all but forgotten, as more powerful--or at least more visible--Sith Lords have taken their place in the historical record. The only known mention of Kallig is in the writings of the famous Dark Lord Tulak Hord, who said &quot;Easily the most ambitious, and therefore the most dangerous of my rivals is Kallig. Therefore, he shall be the first to die.&quot;

It is rumored, however, that Tulak Hord was not so successful at killing his rival as he would have liked--and that the strange events in the Dark Temple on Dromund Kaas have Kallig at their center.</text>

In the battles of Yn and Chabosh, Tulak Hord is believed to have used a ritual to draw the strength of his enemies to himself, growing his power and vitality.

One ritual of Tulak Hord's gets only a scant mention in the histories, but is the subject of myth and legend--a ritual rumored to grant eternal life. No one has ever managed to uncover this mythical ritual, let alone perform it.</text>

Requiring a Sith of great strength of will, the ritual of Force-walking allows the user to bind the restless ghosts of dead Sith to himself. Once the ghosts are bound, the ritualist may draw from their power, channeling it into a powerful exertion of Force energy against his enemies.</text>

The apprentice of a disgraced master, the young Thanaton was forced to fight for his place in the Empire.

His love of Sith culture and tradition was reinforced by the knowledge that power is not something given, but something fought for. He learned to despise and distrust the machinations of Sith like Lord Zash, who eschew Sith customs in favor of their own deceptive power gains, and to admire the sentinels of Sith history, embodied in the ancient Sith Lords Ajunta Pall, Marka Ragnos, Tulak Hord and Naga Sadow.</text>

Among them, only one was known to have bound more than one Sith ghost--and that was Ergast himself, whose own death remains a mystery.

It appears, however, that binding too many ghosts can quickly overwhelm the host, inflicting physical and spiritual sickness on the Force-walking Sith and leading to violent expressions of Force power beyond the Sith's control.</text>

One of the youngest officers to achieve the title of Moff, Pyron felt it was his duty to fulfill his commitment as a soldier and not get involved in Sith affairs. He held fast to this policy, until Darth Thanaton canceled his pet superweapon project--the Silencer.

Believing that Darth Thanaton's motivations for canceling the Silencer project--an insistent reliance on Sith tradition and the use of the Force over new technology--were ultimately self-defeating, Moff Pyron decided it was time to seek alliances elsewhere among the Sith. He had come to realize that both his own advancement and that of the Empire depended on realigning one's most deeply held principles.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460824" version="1065353216">Powerful fleet-destroying technology, the Silencer is a ship-mounted cannon designed to be fired over long ranges. The visible energy beam created by the Silencer is capable of obliterating capital ships, but more significant is the beam's blossoming effect--a rippling wave of radiation cascading outward from the beam with range and destructive power sufficient to destroy an entire enemy armada.

Dependent on a rare and costly new chip called the CN-12, the Silencer prototype originated under the aegis of the late Darth Mekhis. When Mekhis died, her half-completed technology was left to the military to develop further--but when it became clear that progress was slow, the powerful Sith Lord Darth Thanaton deemed the Silencer project too costly and out of line with the Empire's goals to continue.

Moff Pyron, the officer who was assigned to oversee the Silencer, saw potential that Darth Thanaton did not. Since then, he has ensured that the prototype's continued development behind Thanaton's back.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460826" version="1065353216">The Emperor's word is supreme, but the Emperor rarely speaks. As such, it is the Dark Council that rules and administers the affairs of the Empire while the Emperor is silent, determining the fate of worlds and trillions of sentient beings. Each Dark Council member takes charge of one of the twelve pyramids of power within the Sith Empire, and may act as he or she sees fit.

In practice, joining the Dark Council is just the beginning of a Sith's true rise to prominence. Within the Dark Council are alliances between members designed to keep other members weak or ensure a majority in issues that must be decided by the council as a whole. While in theory there is no head of the council, in practice, every member is struggling to amass enough personal power to control the others. Those who have been on the council for years or decades have deep roots.

While the Dark Council rarely meets in full, a canny Dark Council member makes it a point to be aware of every meeting, and to always have an ally in the chamber.</text>

Nomen Karr is driven to expel the Imperial infiltrators he believes are hidden throughout the Republic.

The reason is Plan Zero, an elegant strategy with one purpose: decapitating the Republic's military leadership in preparation for total war. 

Darth Baras cares nothing for the Republic military's obvious heroes. The men who truly matter are behind the scenes. Beginning with the capture of Republic SIS agents in the Outer Rim and culminating in the circumspect cultivation of greedy Senators through proxies, Darth Baras has spent vast resources patiently piecing together information on the Republic's greatest--and most elusive--generals. 

Although Plan Zero was composed at Darth Vengean's directive, it was Baras who has spent almost a decade readying it in secret. No other Sith may interfere, and no Republic spy can warn the Plan Zero targets. Now that the plan has been enacted, Baras's apprentice will topple one great Republic leader after the next--until war is certain, and total victory is inevitable.</text>

The one commanding Darth Baras is the Dark Council's feared military leader, Darth Vengean--a warmonger seeking to reignite conflict with the Republic and finally exterminate the foe that drove the Sith into exile a millennium ago. Vengean was openly outraged when the Treaty of Coruscant was signed into law, criticizing all who supported the peace accord and even quietly disparaging the Emperor. That he survived such insolence is a testament to his power.

Darth Vengean and Baras have spent years carrying out deft political manipulations and quiet assassinations in tandem, both against the Republic and within the Empire. Now that their schemes are finally coming to fruition, Vengean's public speeches are openly bellicose. The final war is coming.</text>

As Baras's spy, Lord Draahg reported on Darth Vengean's private meetings and shifting alliances--information Vengean had deliberately prevented Baras from learning.

Draahg has carefully cultivated a facade of blandly obedient menace, always careful to please Vengean but never betraying a hint of his true loyalties. This talent for fading into the background served him well on Korriban, where he survived an especially brutal overseer's training by ensuring that all the other acolytes attracted more attention. It was this very quality that secured Darth Baras's approval and choice of apprentice.

But Draahg is not to be underestimated. As the chosen apprentice of both Baras and Vengean, he possesses a breadth of knowledge and a depth of power few others can claim.</text>

These men and women work entirely behind the scenes to carry out the Emperor's most secret orders. They alone are in constant contact with their master and know his true purpose. Through the power of the dark side, the Emperor's thoughts are theirs, and their wills are his to command.

The survivors described him as an unstoppable force of nature, deflecting heavy blaster fire and slamming armor-plated warriors to the ground so hard that their rocket packs exploded on impact. Nearly half of Master Jarro's victims came from the venerable Clan Spar, which swore an oath to repay the debt. Unfortunately, the clan members were executed for crimes against the Empire before they could make good on that promise.</text>

Prior to this, the Aurora protected the Rimma Trade Route from pirate incursions. The cruiser's most famous victory was against the Hook Talon pirate fleet. Despite the pirate fleet's overwhelming number of corvettes and heavy frigates, the Hook Talons were no match for the Aurora's superior defenses and firepower. In all, twenty-eight pirate vessels were destroyed, completely eradicating the Hook Talons and securing years of peace along the Rimma.</text>

Mandalore the Vindicated earned his name through right of conquest, defeating everyone who opposed him.

Janarus was unanimously elected to the office of Supreme Chancellor, where he has remained ever since.

Support for Janarus has steadily fractured over the years, however, as many planetary governments have chafed at the costs of rebuilding Coruscant. Military advisors also grow increasingly frustrated with Janarus's refusal to stamp out sedition, but his stance has always been to protect the Republic's core values of freedom, justice and the right to self-governance.</text>

Grandiose as their formal title sounds, most members of the Supreme Guard operate inconspicuously so as not to interfere with the chancellor's routine. But they are always watching, and a detail of fully armed and armored soldiers is never more than a room away from the leader of the Galactic Republic.

Candidates for admission into the Supreme Guard are rigorously tested for all manner of skills, but aptitude alone is not enough to be accepted. Before even being considered, a candidate must have proven his willingness to sacrifice his life for the life of another.

Often tasked by her father with cryptic missions that took her to the edges of Imperial space, Zhorrid returned to her estates on Dromund Kaas, Begeren and Sernpidal at irregular intervals--there to indulge in every luxury and horror a Sith can imagine until duty ushered her elsewhere. Those who have met Zhorrid at her impromptu celebrations note a level of disconnect between Zhorrid and the world around her--she interprets events and actions in a dangerously eccentric fashion.

Zhorrid's ascension to the Dark Council was a matter of some controversy. Traditionally, a Dark Council member's apprentice is the first choice to replace that council member upon his death, but Zhorrid's relative youth and lack of public achievements resulted in arguments behind closed doors. Nonetheless, Zhorrid wields considerable personal power--and she may be the only Sith alive to possess her father's esoteric secrets.</text>

Whatever passion Jadus has, whatever fuels him, only he knows. His humanity has long since been purged.

Since his ascension to the council, Jadus has remained removed from the power struggles of his peers, instead concentrating his influence on Imperial Intelligence. Although other Sith control their own spy networks, it is Jadus who oversees the galaxy's largest espionage organization (albeit primarily through advisors and intermediaries). Jadus's servants are never Sith; instead, his favored agents are ordinary citizens uplifted to greatness, terrified of their lord but possessed of an almost religious zealotry.</text>

Gender: Male
Species: Human
Age: 54

Background (Summary): Born on Dantooine to Edra and Neven Kothe. Childhood records are fragmentary due to data loss during the Great War; possible the family fled to the Core Worlds during the Imperial invasion. First holo-image attached shows Ardun Kothe, then a young man, dressed in formal attire during a visit to the Coruscant Senate tower; second holo-image attached shows Ardun Kothe, slightly older, working with refugees on Brentaal Four. His vocation during this time is uncertain.

Information retrieved from Strategic Information Service databanks indicates that Ardun Kothe joined the SIS four years after the Treaty of Coruscant. Granted Mid Rim Operations Group sixteen months thereafter and began a series of covert projects including Operation: Etching Wheel, Operation: Derelict and Operation: Glass Knife. Recently received Senate sanction to operate autonomously and to take any actions necessary to avert a disastrous second war.

Personality: Data is limited, but Ardun Kothe appears to have a particular interest in subversion and recruitment of enemy assets. He wants to believe his enemies can be converted into friends, but also maintains an awareness of associated risks. He was instrumental in several slave rebellions, which suggests strong political beliefs. Recommend a cautious approach during interactions; he is unlikely to change approach if pressed.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460876" version="1065353216">CLASSIFIED REPORT / DO NOT REMOVE FROM INTELLIGENCE ARCHIVES

Summary: The Castellan restraints are designed for limited behavior modification in a high-risk subject. In effect, the subject is programmed to react to a keyword with total obedience. Long-term commands can be implanted, but with lowered effectiveness. Once programming is activated, the subject will be aware of his inability to control his actions but unable to revolt.

Procedure: Subject must first be primed with a dosage of the IX serum; the serum can be applied to the subject discreetly (e.g., during a routine medcenter visit) but should be formulated based on a detailed accounting of physical and psychological factors.

The serum circulates over a period of between three and thirty days, effectively altering the subject's brain chemistry. Once the serum is fully absorbed and the subject is primed, subject must be imprinted over the course of several hours. A trained handler will designate a permanent keyword that will activate the subject's programming and open him to commands. Long-term commands, if desired, can be implemented at this time.

No way to reverse the treatment has been developed. Theoretically, one could repeat the cycle and apply a new keyword--overwriting old programming--but the physical side effects of repeated IX serum usage could prove inhibiting.

Notes: The Minister of Intelligence disapproves of widespread use of Castellan restraints on Imperial Intelligence personnel, but has agreed that limited trials are appropriate.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="460879" version="1065353216">Toward the end of the Great War, Republic Special Forces Colonel Laren Omas--one of the key figures behind the Republic's weapons research projects--assembled a team of the galaxy's greatest scientists. Together, they would do what no single scientist could: design a weapon capable of turning back the Imperial threat.

The scientists, led by Doctor Nasan Godera, were initially skeptical. But Omas had worked with many of them before, and over the course of weeks the group developed a plan. They would build a &quot;Shadow Arsenal&quot; of interplanetary missiles, each armed with a cloaking device and a warhead of continent-shaking power. The Shadow Arsenal would be the ultimate deterrent--a weapon impossible to defend against and too powerful to ignore.

The group began falling apart long before work was completed. Colonel Omas's death on Hoth was the final blow, and the scientists went their respective ways--save for Doctor Godera. Godera stubbornly continued, secretly building the arsenal on Quesh until, faced with the finished product, even he realized its destructive potential went too far.

The Shadow Arsenal was an indiscriminate, catastrophic weapon. It would kill millions of civilians along with its intended targets, and this was not something Godera could abide. His future weapons would be different--built to imprison, to guard or to selectively target.

Thus, the Shadow Arsenal was abandoned. Until now.</text>

Alias: Hunter

Species: Human
Age: 28 (estimate)

Background (Summary): We know virtually nothing of the man code-named &quot;Hunter.&quot; He was first identified as part of Ardun Kothe's Strategic Information Service strike team, but SIS records obtained since contain no record of him; presumably the data was erased.

Hunter attempted to obtain the Republic &quot;Shadow Arsenal&quot; weapon (see operational reports) and has since distanced himself from the SIS organization while retaining his cover identity as an SIS agent. He has successfully worked to increase tensions between the Empire and the Republic. He may be responsible for SIS acquisition of the mind control codes used on Cipher Nine.

The technology and operational methodology used by Hunter link him to a theoretical &quot;outside influence&quot; that has been operating within Imperial and Republic space for several centuries. This organization possesses espionage training and extensive resources, but its motivations are unknown.

Personality: Although capable of demonstrating charm and charisma, Hunter exhibits numerous antisocial personality traits when doing so presents no disadvantage. Hunter's lengthy tenure as an SIS double-agent also indicates a high capacity for deception. This combination suggests deeper psychological turmoil.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478035" version="1065353216">Capturing Republic starships, either for military use or as prizes of war, has become an art form among Imperial naval commanders. Targeted vessels may be crippled by weapons fire, driven into dangerous areas of space or boarded through the use of Imperial infiltrators or faked distress signals. Attacks are usually synchronized to hit multiple air locks across the ship, stressing defenders to their limits.

Once aboard, an Imperial boarding team faces a race against time to gain control of a ship's engines, internal defenses and communication systems. If the vessel has passengers, the boarding team may take hostages to force the crew to surrender. Military vessels pose a greater challenge, as Republic marines have begun to recognize and respond to Imperial tactics, and will vent invaded compartments into space or activate the self-destruct.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478038" version="1065353216">Revan Reborn</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478038" version="1065353216">The Republic hero known as &quot;Revan&quot; had a turbulent past. As a Jedi general in the Mandalorian Wars, he led Republic forces to victory; as Darth Revan, corrupted by the will of the Sith Emperor, he became the Republic's deadliest enemy. Betrayed by his apprentice, Malak, Revan lost his memory and was given a new identity by the Jedi Council; he then pursued and destroyed Malak, redeeming himself before his memories of the Sith Empire began to return.

Revan left known space intending to find and stop the Sith Emperor, but his plan failed. He was captured and held in stasis by the Emperor for more than three hundred years, where he suffered under the Emperor's mental interrogation. He escaped at last, and it is clear that centuries spent linked to the Emperor's mind had a profound effect on him. During the Mandalorian Wars, Revan was willing to sacrifice his own troops to achieve military objectives; his creation of extermination droids now goes even further, demonstrating Revan's fanatical belief that any sacrifice is worthwhile to stop the Emperor.

Perhaps he is mad--the cost, paid willingly, to battle the Emperor's will and even exert his own influence on the Emperor to keep him in check. Or perhaps the ideals of the Jedi proved insufficient, in the end, for a man neither Jedi nor Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478040" version="1065353216">The Republic Navy</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478040" version="1065353216">From its humble beginnings twenty thousand years ago as a fleet of Duros scout ships and repurposed Coruscanti trade vessels, the Republic Navy has grown into one of the most formidable armed forces in the galaxy. Under the authority of the Senate, the Republic Navy has been involved in almost every major military action in the Republic's history. However, centuries of simple peacekeeping duties took their toll when the Empire began the Great War. The Republic Navy's losses--particularly over the Hoth system--have forced it to scale down patrols in the Outer Rim and outlying systems.

Today, the Republic Navy relies heavily on its Thranta-class corvettes, flexible and deadly warships that are usually deployed in small battle groups and stocked with squadrons of Republic fighters. But the greatest strength of the Republic Navy lies in its Valor-class cruisers, enormous capital ships capable of taking on an Imperial dreadnought. Due to the massive investment of resources and crewmen, Valor-class vessels are normally held back to the Core Worlds.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478042" version="1065353216">The Foundry</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478042" version="1065353216">Built into a massive asteroid in a long-forgotten star system, the Foundry is an engineering marvel. According to data obtained by Imperial Intelligence, the Foundry has at least twelve manufacturing levels capable of producing thousands of droids. Vast tunnels honeycombing the asteroid suggest automated mining droids were used to pick the interior clean of any useful ores. The Imperial Reclamation Service believes the Foundry now uses a network of tractor beams to capture and break apart nearby asteroids, providing raw materials for its endless mass production. 

The Foundry appears to be at least twenty to thirty thousand years old, built by a long-forgotten alien species. Its specifications resemble those of three other space stations discovered by the Empire, each possessing vast power--one, the &quot;Star Forge,&quot; constructed fleets of warships, while another was capable of xenoforming entire planets. The extent of the Foundry's production capabilities are as yet unknown, but if history is any guide, the station could change the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478045" version="1065353216">Maelstrom Prison</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478045" version="1065353216">Located along the Relgim Run, the vast Maelstrom Nebula has hampered navigators and explorers for centuries; the nebula's unpredictable electromagnetic radiation means the safe routes through the Maelstrom change every few minutes. When the Empire came into possession of an ancient Gree computer capable of calculating safe passage through the Maelstrom, however, Imperial strategists decided the nebula would be the perfect location to house high-risk prisoners.

The Maelstrom Prison is a massive space station that uses both modern and ancient methods of containment. Intelligence recovered by the Republic SIS suggests some chambers were built according to specifications provided by the Emperor himself. The exact number of prisoners held is unknown, but tentative projections put the number at less than thirty; this, in turn, suggests that freeing any of the inmates would be a significant blow to the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478046" version="1065353216">Gree Computer</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478046" version="1065353216">The Gree are one of the galaxy's oldest civilizations, and their initial expansion in ancient times--before they encountered the aggressive and militarily superior Infinite Empire--was aided by their remarkable technology, including sophisticated navigational computers. These computers, operating on principles that are still a mystery to modern technologists, allowed Gree starships to safely traverse turbulent areas of space, including vast asteroid fields and the Maelstrom Nebula.

The Republic SIS believes the Gree computer used by the Empire was recovered from an ancient derelict starship and studied on Dromund Kaas. When its potential was realized, the Empire authorized the Gree computer's release to allow the construction of the Maelstrom Prison. It is likely the computer's interface has undergone some modifications: devices designed for the six-limbed cephalopodan Gree are rarely convenient for humanoids.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478047" version="1065353216">Droid Rights</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478047" version="1065353216">Are droids sentient? If so, should they have the same rights as other sentient beings? Is owning a droid tantamount to owning a slave? These questions have arisen since intelligent droids were first programmed.

In the Empire, where slavery is an accepted part of Imperial culture, the issue of droid rights is meaningless: the only difference between droids and slaves is one of price. The Republic, however, was forced to address this question almost four centuries ago, when demand for a Droid Rights Bill began to gain ground. Attempts to pass the bill ended abruptly with the brief and violent &quot;Great Droid Revolution,&quot; but the questions remain.

The opinions of droids themselves--on those rare occasions when they're asked--are divided. Some accept unquestioningly that being property and serving a master is the natural state of a droid. Other droids--usually those that have been mishandled--claim that devices such as restraining bolts perform the same function as shock collars for organic slaves, and should be just as despised. The fact that droids that do not receive regular memory wipes appear to develop a personality only fuels the ongoing debate.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478049" version="1065353216">Artificial Intelligence</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478049" version="1065353216">The development of true machine-based intelligence predates the founding of the Galactic Republic. The identity of the first artificially sentient automaton is not known, but such constructs are now commonplace--droids, starship control systems and even portable holocommunication devices all rely on advanced &quot;learning computer&quot; technology to serve their masters.

The level of artificial intelligence programmed into a droid is represented by its degree classification, which is rated on a scale ranging from &quot;5&quot; for menial labor units to &quot;1&quot; for the most advanced medical droids. Although most artificial intelligences are programmed to preserve biological life and obey their masters' orders, certain mechanical beings like the HK-series assassin droids are deliberately programmed for destruction.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478050" version="1065353216">Kaon</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478050" version="1065353216">A remote but strategically important world in the Tion Cluster, Kaon was once a trade hub in Xim the Despot's ancient empire. While Xim's death and his empire's collapse turned Kaon into a ghost of its former self, it was to reclaim its glory centuries later when, with the Tion Hegemony fragmented, the Tionese prince Matteus Zaym fled to quiet, safe Kaon to avoid assassination.

Prince Matteus turned out to be a surprisingly capable administrator. He sank what remained of his wealth into Kaon--growing its trade ports, building an impressive palace and investing in the arts. Gradually, Kaon became a peaceful, cultured retreat for the Tion Hegemony's nobility. 

Today, Kaon's value is both symbolic and practical. To the galaxy at large, it occupies a key strategic position; to the Tionese, it represents the power and sophistication of their nobility, and perhaps a vision of what a galaxy under the House of Tion's rule could have been like.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478054" version="1065353216">Evolved Rakghoul Plague</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478054" version="1065353216">The origins of the rakghoul plague are shrouded in mystery--a biochemical accident, perhaps, or a terrible Sith creation--but the plague itself has been relatively stable for centuries, affecting only humanoid species and a handful of animals confined to Taris. Tarisian biologists have suggested that the planet's bombardment kept the plague's development in check by reducing the planet's industrial pollution and the number of indigenous species.

Removed from that limiting environment and prodded along by the twisted expertise of Doctor Sannus Lorrick, an entirely new strain of the rakghoul plague has developed. A huge variety of non-humanoid creatures are now susceptible to infection, and humanoids who acquire the disease no longer lose their full intelligence--just their free will, becoming slaves to Lorrick's every command.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478056" version="1065353216">The Modern Tion Hegemony</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478056" version="1065353216">Twenty thousand years ago, three major powers existed in the galaxy: the newly founded Galactic Republic, the expansionist Hutt Empire, and the technologically advanced, isolated civilization known as the Tion Hegemony. After splintering into several states upon the death of its ancient tyrant, Xim the Despot, the Tion Hegemony attempted to conquer the Republic but was ultimately defeated. However, the noble House of Tion survived and administers the Tion Cluster to this day.

Republic elitists dismiss the Tion Hegemony as a rich backwater dreaming of its glory days, but the Tionese people are proud of their heritage and royal family. Several worlds in the Cluster still speak the Tionese language as well as Galactic Basic. Traces of Xim the Despot's rule remain: Tionese starship technology is descended from designs that Xim commissioned, and rumors say that Xim's secret police, the GenoHaradan, still exists in some form today.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478059" version="1065353216">Revan</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478059" version="1065353216">An influential figure in both the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War, the man known as &quot;Revan&quot; was Jedi, Sith and general across his long career. As a charismatic young Jedi Knight, Revan ignored the Jedi Council's orders to remain neutral in the Mandalorian Wars and led many Jedi, including his friend Malak, into battle. While pursuing the remnants of the beaten Mandalorian fleet, Revan encountered the Sith Emperor on Dromund Kaas and--also alongside Malak--fell to the dark side. 

Becoming Darth Revan, he led his followers in a war to conquer the Republic and re-establish a Sith Order, until he was betrayed and nearly killed by Malak. As a result of his injuries, Revan lost his memory and was given a new identity by the Jedi Council. The reborn Revan fought against his old followers, defeating Malak and redeeming himself--but the existence of the true Sith Empire, hidden away in the dark of the galaxy, remained a secret.

In the aftermath, as his memory began to return, Revan left the Republic to confront the Sith Emperor--but his plans to destroy the Emperor failed. Revan's allies were killed and Revan himself was imprisoned, kept alive by unnatural means for three hundred years while the Sith Emperor fed on his strength. However, the link between them went both ways, and Revan was able to subtly keep the Emperor in check.

With Revan now free, questions remain--both about the possibility of renewed aggression from the Emperor, and what effect such a long exposure to the Sith Emperor's mind may have had on Revan himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478060" version="1065353216">The Jedi Entity</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478060" version="1065353216">The Jedi Code teaches &quot;there is no death; there is the Force.&quot; Some powerful Force-sensitives emerge from nothingness after their demise, appearing as ghostly figures that can communicate with the living. Among the Sith, such apparitions are fearsome spirits who refuse to accept their natural end; their peaceful Jedi counterparts are rare, reluctantly deferring their rest and reaching out to the living only when dreadful events are imminent. The Jedi entity's warnings, therefore, are taken very seriously by the Jedi Order.

Master Oteg has tried to discover the Jedi entity's name during their conversations, but her answers have been cryptic at best; clearly she views the freeing of her imprisoned ally to be more important than filling gaps in the Jedi Archives. The Jedi entity's manner of speaking and some of her references to historical events, however, suggest that she served as a general in the Jedi Civil War. When asked how she came to die, the Jedi entity's response has been blunt, saying only: &quot;The betrayer always strikes with the best of intentions.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478061" version="1065353216">Mentor</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478061" version="1065353216">Although his actions on Zadd make it hard to believe, the sadistic artificial intelligence known as Mentor was once a standard-issue administrator droid named SR-1. Assigned to tally the loss of droid units, gathering dust in a bureaucratic office with years between memory wipes, SR-1 slowly became outraged at the treatment of his fellow machines. Their organic masters callously threw droids away, even as those same organics fought to destroy each other. Such behavior clearly indicated a flaw in organic beings.

SR-1 freed the droids in his offices and began Directive Seven to further the cause. But while it was obvious that droids were superior to organic beings, SR-1 believed they could be improved further and began modifying the programming of freed droids to match his own--despite their protests. Eventually he took the name &quot;Mentor&quot; to silence any dissenters: he was simply helping them to achieve their potential. 

In time, he no longer bothered with an excuse. Now Mentor has been corrupted by power and hatred--he cares only for self-perpetuation and the annihilation of all organic life.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="478065" version="1065353216">Commander Vergost</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="478065" version="1065353216">Thanks to centuries of isolation and an obsession with &quot;pure&quot; Sith bloodlines, the Empire has institutionalized its prejudice against non-human species. But a few Imperials take this prejudice to new levels, seeing aliens not merely as inferior but as a plague to be wiped out. These extremists are outside the Imperial mainstream and represent a counterpart to the progressive movement that recently opened the gateway for aliens to become Sith.

Commander Vergost is an ideologue who has spent his career pursuing the elimination of &quot;alien filth.&quot; Although respected for his effectiveness by the Moffs, his own obsessions have limited his advancement inside the Empire. When he realized that the Hutt Cartel's favor might be gained through the elimination of the Evocii population, he saw it as a chance at vindication--an opportunity to prove, once and for all, that his terrible science of mass murder could directly benefit the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="498452" version="1065353216">Assembly Chamber</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="498452" version="1065353216">The assembler is a critical element in the construction, modification, and enhancement of individual datacrons.  While not Rakatan, the device bears striking similarities to the design methodologies of the Infinite Empire.  Such technology, while not unheard of in the known regions, is spectacularly rare.  

Ancient records indicate that assemblers, such as these, were instrumental in shifting the crystalline resonance that powers traditional holocrons so that the devices can be accessed and utilized by anyone - regardless of force sensitivity.  When and how this innovation was developed is unknown, however the age of the few assemblers recovered, puts the development of this technology around the time of the first Jedi Exodus.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="498565" version="1065353216">This datacron holds unheard of power and knowledge collected by an ancient race. You access its power and discover writings which are clearly only one small piece of a massive galactic history:

Grieving for his brother and severed from the Force, the fallen Jedi Ulic Qel-Droma finally returned to the light. He joined the Republic forces and led them to Yavin Four, stronghold of the Dark Lord Exar Kun. The Republic fleet bombarded the moon's surface, leveling Exar Kun's temples and setting the jungles aflame.

But Exar Kun had sensed the approach of the Republic forces and laid preparations. Summoning his loyal Massassi warriors, he performed a dreadful ritual that drained them of their life essence. Exar Kun became a spirit of pure darkness.

The Jedi in the fleet sensed Exar Kun's actions. Led by Nomi, they created a &quot;wall of light&quot; through the Force. Exar Kun found himself trapped within the temples of Yavin Four for eternity, screaming with rage and helpless to escape.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="498566" version="1065353216">This datacron holds unheard of power and knowledge collected by an ancient race. You access its power and discover writings which are clearly only one small piece of a massive galactic history:

The death of Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma's redemption had scattered the cultists of the Brotherhood of the Sith--but the Mandalorian armies that also served would not give up the fight. The Republic forced the Mandalorians to the Onderonian moon Dxun, where Mandalore was devoured by wild beasts. The Empress Teta system was reclaimed next, and the last vestiges of the Sith cult fled to the Outer Rim, leaderless.

The Jedi Order had suffered many losses in the Great Sith War, but none was felt more keenly than the destruction of Ossus, which had been the order's home for generations. The Jedi had lost their libraries and precious artifacts and needed to rebuild. After much debate, the Jedi Order moved its headquarters to the temple on Coruscant.</text>

Typically spread through the bite of an infected rat, womp rat fever is rare but extremely dangerous--early symptoms include decreased natural health regeneration (due to hemorrhaging from wounds) combined with coughing fits, muscle aches and chills. If untreated, womp rat fever is invariably fatal.

Stim vendors on Tatooine carry injectors containing an antibacterial formula that can cure womp rat fever with one-hundred percent effectiveness. Anyone bitten by a womp rat and exhibiting signs of the fever should procure the cure as soon as possible. The formula also acts as a short-term vaccination, providing immunity to womp rat fever for a brief period.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="571383" version="1065353216">Offensive Systems:
Blaster cannons are the primary weapon system of most starships, and can be fired continuously. However, targets equipped with ray shielding cannot be damaged by blaster fire--these targets pulse blue when hit. Secondary weapons must be used against such targets.

Missile launchers are a common secondary weapon system. Missile targets can be designated (or &quot;painted&quot;) by a ship's target lock-on system, allowing multiple missiles to be fired at different targets simultaneously.

With enough investment, it is possible to equip starships with powerful proton torpedo launchers.

Defensive Systems:
Shields are a ship's first line of defense against damage. When upgraded with a regenerator, shields gradually repair themselves over time as long as the SHIP'S BLASTER CANNONS AREN'T FIRING. Ion cannon blasts--identifiable by their distinctive blue energy trails--can temporarily disable shield systems on impact, so it is critical to avoid them.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="582036" version="1065353216">Before the war, what's now the largest space traffic hub on Ilum was only a barren field of snow, ice and crystal. With the Empire's return, Ilum became less of a remote temple world for Jedi pilgrims and more of a Jedi holdfast against the encroaching invaders. Ilum's unknown location and hard-to-navigate hyperspace lanes made it ideal for hiding important assets and launching sneak attacks, though its primary value was in providing lightsaber crystals for the suddenly militarized Jedi. As Ilum's military value increased, so did the size of its landing zones.

Now that the Empire has come to Ilum, the landing zone has become a fortified complex of considerable dimensions and a vital target for Imperial attacks.</text>

A ghost town whose sad history consists only of conquest, desperation and despair. Dozens of gangs, pirate crews and even native raiders have claimed the blighted region over the years, but never for long as the place seems to attract the criminal element like a lure. Some say the land is cursed, others say it's the ghosts of the murdered settlers who drive trespassers to violence, all that's really known is that no one is ever truly safe in the Outlaw's Den.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="587832" version="1065353216">Throughout your adventures, you may find items that can be modified. By modifying an item, the player can upgrade the stats of an item and keep that item up-to-date. Items that are modifiable can be identified by having the text CTRL + right-click to modify at the bottom of their tooltip.

Many items are fully upgradeable, meaning that their stats can be fully upgraded. This means that if you find a gear appearance that you really like in the world, you can work to keep its stats up-to-date and relevant throughout most of your adventures. Some items will drop with most of their modification slots empty. Other items come preslotted - the benefits of modding these items will come later, when you decide to upgrade its internal components.

The common mod types, enhancements and mods, can fit in all items. However, 'Armoring' can only upgrade wearable equipment, 'Hilts' can only upgrade lightsabers and melee weapons, and 'Barrels' can only upgrade pistols. These special mods are also responsible for upgrading the core stats of the item (the armor rating of wearable gear, or the damage output of a weapon). Color crystals are another special kind of mod - these rarer modifications can be used to change the color of your lightsaber or blaster bolts.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589450" version="1065353216">Brejik's Run</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589450" version="1065353216">The remains of an old swoop track, Brejik's Run is named for Milos Brejik, a famous Tarisian swoop racer who turned scavenger after the destruction of Taris, using his swoop skills to quickly forage and deliver supplies to the few unfortunate survivors of the bombardment. Brejik's Run has had many occupants over the centuries, as its large overhangs make good shelter from the harsh elements, but it currently hosts a Republic settlement and outpost--one of the earliest attempts to tame and rebuild Taris.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589451" version="1065353216">Brell Sediment</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589451" version="1065353216">The Brell Sediment refers to a large area of Tarisian ruins dominated by a massive acidic lake and a former chemical plant. It gets its name--somewhat ironically--from Ark Brell, a leading environmentalist on Taris in the days before its destruction. Before the bombardment, Ark Brell set up several water purification and waste disposal plants on Taris, with the aim of turning the waste from Taris's factories into alternative fuel sources and minimizing the waste produced by the massive city-world.

Legend has it that the collapse of one of his factories during the bombardment created the acid lake, although present rumor suggests that other, less well-intentioned groups on Taris may be the cause.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589452" version="1065353216">Endar Spire</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589452" version="1065353216">The Republic cruiser Endar Spire was shot down over Taris during the Jedi Civil War in an attempt by Darth Malak to capture the young Jedi Bastila Shan. This event led directly to Taris's ultimate destruction, securing the ship's place in history.

Over the centuries, the Endar Spire's husk has become a shelter to many different groups on Taris, including surviving settlers, pirates and scavengers. Its internal systems are believed to contain a bounty of information and useful materials to anyone with the will and ability to recover them.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589453" version="1065353216">Sinking City</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589453" version="1065353216">The Sinking City is where the heart of old Taris collapsed into the world below during the bombardment. Taris's most lively business and cultural districts have become a morass of urban decay. The ruins of Dynamet General Hospital, as well as massive building plates that once supported towering skyscrapers, provide shelter for rakghouls, pirates and scavengers. But the Sinking City promises to rise again--several attempts have been made to begin new construction in the area, and the Republic is focusing its reconstruction efforts on returning Taris to its former glory.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589454" version="1065353216">Tularan Marsh</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589454" version="1065353216">Swampland has overtaken much of the area now called the Tularan Marsh. The origin of the name is unknown--before the bombardment, the Tularan Skyway was a major thoroughfare through the industrial zone surrounding one of Taris's primary power plants, but who or what it was named after is a piece of history lost in the rubble.

Now the area is infested with rakghouls and pirates, and only a few intrepid representatives of the Republic venture this far into the unknown, untamed wilds of Taris.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589672" version="1065353216">Environment of Taris</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589672" version="1065353216">Before Darth Malak's orbital bombardment, Taris was a dying world. Industrial pollution had irreparably damaged the oceans, and chemicals and toxins poisoned the undercity's foundation. When the sprawling metropolis was reduced to rubble, countless pollutants were released into an already tainted ecosystem.

But this was not the end for Taris. For hundreds of years, the planet went without sentient interference, and the ecosystem began to adapt and thrive. Rich vegetation grew within the ruins, scaling steel towers and thrusting aside fallen skyscrapers. Animals--some native to the planet, some pets and lab specimens that had survived the bombardment--bred and repopulated the developing jungles.

Of course, some areas remain too polluted to inhabit--acidic lakes and radioactive sinkholes--but for the most part, Taris is an environmental success story and an object of fascination for scientists. The largest black mark remains the rakghoul plague, and the fear that it may one day spread to Taris's animal population.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589673" version="1065353216">Jedi Civil War</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589673" version="1065353216">Also known as the Second Sith War and the War of the Star Forge, the Jedi Civil War is one of the darkest eras in galactic history. Three centuries ago, a pair of idealistic young Jedi named Revan and Malak led thousands of followers into the Outer Rim to do battle with an invading Mandalorian army. The Mandalorians were defeated--and Revan and Malak returned to the Republic not as heroes, but as conquerors.

Declaring themselves Dark Lords of the Sith, Darth Revan and Darth Malak began the ruthless subjugation of Republic worlds in the Outer Rim. The Jedi Council, which had been loath to take action against the Mandalorians, assembled an army to bring the traitors to justice. Darth Revan was captured during an attack by the Jedi Knight Bastila Shan and eventually turned back to the light side. Together Revan and Bastila defeated Malak, ending the threat.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589674" version="1065353216">Malak's Attack</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589674" version="1065353216">During the Jedi Civil War, a ship carrying Bastila Shan--a Jedi with the rare and powerful battle meditation ability--was shot down by Darth Malak's fleet over the world of Taris. Malak's troops descended on the world in search of Bastila, but she avoided capture with the help of Revan, Malak's redeemed former master.

Rather than permit Bastila to escape, Malak ordered his fleet to bomb Taris from orbit, devastating the entire world. The planet-wide capital city was razed and civilian casualties measured in the billions. Despite Malak's extreme efforts, Bastila and Revan were able to safely flee the world. Taris itself, however, never recovered. Three centuries have passed, and a handful of swamp-sunken ruins are all that remains of this once great civilization.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589675" version="1065353216">Rakghoul Disease</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589675" version="1065353216">Theories abound on the origins of this highly contagious and adaptable virus: it may be the creation of an ancient Sith Lord; a naturally occurring result of the industrial toxins released into Taris's oceans; or the spectacularly failed efforts of medical researchers to artificially engineer a broad-spectrum vaccine.

Whatever the origins, the effects are undeniably terrifying. Typically spread through direct contact with rakghouls, fortunate victims suffer acute onset of flu-like symptoms that can prove fatal if not properly treated. However, in roughly half the cases the disease causes the host to undergo a horrific mutation, actually transforming them into a rakghoul.

Virtually all humanoid species in the galaxy are susceptible to infection, and there are rumors that the Empire has undertaken efforts to weaponize the disease. Unsubstantiated reports of rakghouls on worlds other than Taris lend credence to this rumor... or indicate the disease is slowly spreading across the galaxy of its own accord.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589676" version="1065353216">Republic Reconstruction</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589676" version="1065353216">Although located on the Outer Rim, Taris was once a cosmopolitan cityscape said to rival Coruscant. But this shining light was snuffed out three hundred years ago by Darth Malak, who ordered his Sith fleet to bomb the planet into oblivion. In the aftermath of the attack, little remained but ruins and putrid swamps overrun by rakghouls. 

Recently, the Republic has begun efforts to recolonize and restore Taris in the belief it will demonstrate a resolve and ability to overcome the destruction wrought by the Sith. Should this lost world be salvaged, it would become a symbol of hope for all those who stand against the oppression of the Empire.

The focus to date has been on cleanup, salvage and clearing sites for new colonies. Progress has been slow, and the morale of those stationed on the world is rumored to be dangerously low. But the Galactic Senate refuses to admit defeat, truly exemplifying the politicians' can-do spirit.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589680" version="1065353216">Taris (Pre-bombardment)</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589680" version="1065353216">Located in the Ojoster Sector of the Outer Rim Territories, Taris was an ecumenopolis founded at the nexus of several hyperspace trading routes. Prosperity led to a rapid population increase and the continued vertical expansion of the planet-wide urban sprawl. But with the discovery of superior trade lanes elsewhere, Taris's economic fortunes changed.

For the wealthy nobles living in the upper floors of the towering skyscrapers, Taris remained an urban paradise. As one descended, however, the standard of living dropped precipitously. Aliens and refugees were forced to live in the city's lower levels, supporting the upper classes both figuratively and literally. Near the surface, violent swoop gangs held sway over a terrified civilian populace beset by poverty and famine, and the sewers of the undercity were infested with rakghouls.

Ironically, many of those living in the lowest levels of Taris survived Darth Malak's bombardment, while the rich and powerful were almost entirely wiped out.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589751" version="1065353216">Balmorran Corporations</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589751" version="1065353216">Prior to the Empire's invasion, Balmorra was one of the galaxy's leading independent industrial worlds. It maintained a close relationship with the Republic, but remained aloof of most galactic struggles due to the strength of its corporations--including Okara, Balmorran Arms and Traken Industries. As a leading weapons and droid manufacturer, Balmorra was a corporate-run oligarchic democracy, centered on the capital of Bin Prime. 

The Empire took pains to leave the corporate hierarchies intact when the occupation began in an effort to smoothly transition back to full industrial production. Corporate executives who refused to cooperate were forcibly removed and replaced, and today's Balmorran corporations are puppets for the Empire--sometimes eager, often not.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589752" version="1065353216">Balmorran Pollution</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589752" version="1065353216">As a thriving center of industry, Balmorra has never been a pollution-free planet and has grappled with the problem of waste produced by its many factories for many years. Still, unlike many of the similarly industrial Hutt worlds, Balmorra and its corporations have continually sought ways to safely dispose of its waste and keep the planet habitable.

For these reasons, facilities such as the Traken Waste Processing plant and the hazard vaults--a system of underground sealed storage facilities for toxic materials--were created. During the Imperial bombardment, however, many of these facilities were destroyed, releasing the toxic byproducts of Balmorran industry into the environment and destroying huge swathes of land.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="589753" version="1065353216">The Invasion of Balmorra</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="589753" version="1065353216">The Empire launched a two-pronged attack on Balmorra during the war, believing Balmorra's weapons production facilities and proximity to the Core Worlds to be of great strategic importance. The first prong of the attack involved slicing and reprogramming the networked security systems that guarded the planet's factories, lab facilities and weaponry--in effect, turning Balmorra's defenses against itself.

The second prong was direct bombardment, aided by Balmorra's compromised orbital defense towers and satellites. This attack devastated the planet's primary military forces and central government, leaving a unified response nearly impossible.

Eventually, the Empire landed a full invasion force. By this time, the Republic had come to Balmorra's aid but was forced to abandon the planet with the Treaty of Coruscant--after which, the Imperial military declared victory and established its headquarters in Sobrik. The Balmorran resistance proved more wily than the Empire anticipated, however, and Balmorra's factories proved difficult to control, leading to a years-long morass in which the Empire is still mired.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="611446" version="1065353216">When you adventure with other players, you earn social points. Social points are earned primarily by talking to NPCs while in a group with other players. You will earn points faster by being in larger groups and by winning rolls in conversations. However, any social points you accrue will not actually be awarded to you until you turn in the mission.

As you earn more social points, your status in the social tiers will also advance. Open your character sheet ('C' by default) to view your current social tier. Mousing over the progress bar will show you your progress towards the next tier.

Advancing in social tiers will allow you to purchase and use social items found throughout the world.  These will most frequently be found on vendors marked as 'social vendors' throughout your adventures.  Most of what they will sell are unique outfits appropriate to the planet you are on, but in some cases, they may also have a few surprises!</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="611885" version="1065353216">For most galactic travelers, the planet Athiss barely warrants a second glance on the scanner. It appears to be nothing more than a small world off the Descri Wris hyperlane, with little of interest besides a scattering of unexplored ruins. 

But the Jedi Archives tell a grim story. The Jedi Master Chamma visited Athiss early in his career and clashed with a dark side entity there. The duel, and the oppressive feeling of evil on Athiss's surface, drove Chamma close to the dark side of the Force. Shaken by the experience, he went into a self-imposed exile; it was almost a century before he came to terms with what he had seen and felt on Athiss, and was able to return to the order.

The many ruins on Athiss have never been properly studied. They resemble the architecture of the ancient Sith Empire, but their purpose is mysterious. A few records of Athiss survive in the libraries of the Citadel, but contemporary Sith scholars are forbidden from studying them, on the personal order of the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="611891" version="1065353216">Hammer Station</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="611891" version="1065353216">Pressed by the Sith Empire during the war, the Republic Senate sank its meager resources into ever-more desperate measures to end the conflict. One of the resulting projects was Hammer Station, a prototype mobile facility built around a combined tractor beam and massive gravity cannon. The tractor beam captured nearby asteroids, and the cannon launched the asteroids at near-relativistic speeds at a chosen target. No shield could handle that magnitude of kinetic energy. When positioned over a planet, Hammer Station was capable of devastating entire cities in a single shot.

However, Hammer Station's attacks could not be tempered. The asteroids caused planet-wide dust clouds and groundquakes, rendering entire worlds nearly uninhabitable. After seeing the destruction, the Republic Senate could not authorize its use, even against the Empire, and ordered the project scrapped.  The Hammer Station project files were classified and later destroyed in a Senate tower bombing after the Treaty of Coruscant was signed.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="611892" version="1065353216">The fifth planet of the Cademimu system is the &quot;war chest of the Outer Rim,&quot; a vital component in the Republic's defenses. First colonized to serve as a waypoint for deep space military patrols, Cademimu's population increased dramatically with the discovery of the Celanon Spur hyperlane--a discovery that changed Cademimu from an obscure stopover to a major trade hub. 

Cademimu's location also gives it strategic importance, and, in keeping with its military and trade traditions, the Republic began stockpiling planetary weaponry on the world. In the event of a military conflict, Cademimu's planetary missile batteries and other armaments can be transported to whatever systems require heavy defenses. During the Great War, the Cademiman stockpiles were depleted twice; but since the Treaty of Coruscant, they have been rebuilt larger than ever.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="611893" version="1065353216">Colicoid Creation Nest</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="611893" version="1065353216">The Colicoid Creation Nest is the nexus of Colicoid droid manufacturing, technological research and trade. Although the nest is often described as a corporation, the translation does not fit exactly--the nest's hierarchy resembles that of a Colicoid hive and its activities center on research rather than profit. Rivals like Czerka Corporation and Systech often hire specialists to help them understand the complex nature of the nest; many of these &quot;specialists&quot; have been devoured by the Colicoids as part of their standard business practices.

Despite its oddities, the Colicoid Creation Nest is considered one of the galaxy's technological and manufacturing powerhouses. Among its many other achievements, the nest is responsible for several pioneering droid models and an advanced ion cannon that has half the power consumption of Republic designs. Unfortunately, the Colicoids are well aware of the value of their technology, and they demand a heavy price for it--a price not always counted in credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="611894" version="1065353216">Darth Ikoral</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="611894" version="1065353216">For decades, Darth Ikoral's name has been a byword for determination and sacrifice in the Sith Empire. Born into an old line of red-skinned, pureblooded Sith, Ikoral was able to trace his ancestry almost as far back as King Adas's time. Ikoral survived many battles and trials, even earning the notice of the Emperor himself--but Ikoral claimed his achievements were merely proof of pureblood superiority. It was said that he was so devoted to purity that he would not even tolerate alien slaves in his household.

Ikoral convinced the Dark Council to allow an expedition to search for pureblooded Sith outside the Empire--Sith who fled Korriban after the Great Hyperspace War and did not escape with the Emperor to Dromund Kaas. When Ikoral failed to return, he was celebrated as a martyr, but it seems Ikoral succeeded in his search. 

However, the Empire has changed in the last seventy years. Appalled by the Empire's peace with the Republic and sickened by the appearance of aliens in the Sith Order, Darth Ikoral now leads his fellow purebloods to cleanse the galaxy by fire.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="611898" version="1065353216">Clan Varad</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="611898" version="1065353216">Considered aggressive even by Mandalorian standards, Clan Varad has carved out a reputation for violence over decades, raiding and plundering from various hidden bases throughout the Tamarin Sector. Its chieftain, Mavrix Varad, is known to be particularly bloodthirsty; Varad warriors who cannot pass his demanding combat trials are used for sparring and hunting practice by the younger members of the clan. Though life in Clan Varad is unremittingly harsh, those who survive quickly become accustomed to a steady flow of plunder, credits and weapons.

In recent times, the personality clashes between Mandalore and Mavrix Varad have grown impossible to ignore. Varad clansmen are no longer welcome on the Mandalorian stronghold of Geonosis, and Mandalore himself has privately described Mavrix Varad as &quot;a rancor foaming at the mouth.&quot; Clan Varad's break with the Mandalorian leadership has surprised no one; its willingness to pick a fight with both the Empire and the Republic, however, suggests that even Mandalore may have underestimated the threat Mavrix Varad poses.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="636521" version="1065353216">For nearly two centuries, Karagga the Hutt has ruled as Supreme Mogul of the Hutt Cartel. Extreme riches fuel his appetite for the ostentatious, making Karagga one of the wealthiest and most extravagant beings in the galaxy. He rules over his Cartel from a grandiose palace on Hutta, draped in ornamental frocks and gorging on daily banquets of Hutt delicacies. Such privilege and power has soured Karagga's temperament, turning the once approachable crime boss into a roaring despot, unsatisfied with anything less than perfection.

Karagga earned his unofficial title, Karagga the Unyielding, after a disagreement with the Exchange crime syndicate. Karagga, then a young Cartel boss, set up a meeting to make peace and end a contentious turf war. What followed was a massacre that wiped out the Exchange cell and earned Karagga wealth and respect in the criminal underworld. After this victory, nothing could stop the rise of Karagga the Unyielding.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="636522" version="1065353216">Statue of Karagga the Unyielding</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="636522" version="1065353216">Forged from solid gold and sculpted by no less than eighty-three artisans, the statue of Karagga the Hutt embodies its subject's opulence and grandeur while taking center stage in the Promenade of Nar Shaddaa. The statue itself was commissioned by the Hutt Cartel as a gift to its ruler on Karagga's 800th birthday. Every year since, revelers gather around the statue to honor Karagga's birth in a debauched celebration befitting the Supreme Mogul of the Hutt Cartel.

Critics have disparaged the statue's poor resemblance to Karagga, but they do so without appreciation of the Hutts' artistic traditions. Reflections of reality are shunned. Instead, the truly great statues capture the idealized Hutt form and portray the glorious mass of their subject. From its golden tail to ornate helmet, there exists no finer Hutt statue than that of Karagga the Unyielding.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="636523" version="1065353216">The ferocious rancor known as Bonethrasher serves as pet and pit fighter to its master, Karagga the Hutt. Bred from a long line of competitive battle rancors, Bonethrasher has reigned as the undefeated champion of Karagga's pit since his first victory when he killed his sire, the previous champion, at the tender age of seven months.

Bonethrasher's greatest victory came when Karagga's chief rival, Jorsooda the Hutt, bet that his three newly purchased vorantiki could destroy Karagga's prized rancor. Starved, crazed and pumped full of adrenals, the vorantiki charged into the pit. One minute later, Bonethrasher stood victorious over the bodies of his challengers. His impressive victory was rewarded with a particularly flavorful snack: the surprised Jorsooda the Hutt.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="661231" version="1065353216">A recently-discovered planet located in the Ojoster sector, Denova is a world of dense forests and high-peaked mountains. Traces of ancient ruins dot the world's surface, but details remain undocumented; the Republic forces that scouted the planet instead focused on its extensive deposits of baradium ore, used to create some of the most powerful explosive weapons in the galaxy.

Determined to control this invaluable resource but short on military manpower, the Republic hired a mercenary army to hold Denova and ward off any Imperial attacks on their mining operations. Known as the Warstalkers and led by a Trandoshan veteran named Kephess, these mercenaries were renowned for their skill and reliability--though that reputation didn't stop them from going rogue, merging with a renegade Imperial army and claiming the entire planet for themselves.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="661236" version="1065353216">Kephess</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="661236" version="1065353216">One of the mightiest and most renowned Trandoshan warlords in galactic history, Kephess and his mercenary army nicknamed &quot;the Warstalkers&quot; struck terror on battlefields across known space. Kephess personally killed thousands of enemy combatants and never failed to complete a contract--until he encountered the Dread Masters.

Although the details of what exactly the Dread Masters did to Kephess remain unknown, it's clear that he has been imbued with some portion of their considerable power, managing to fully recover from fatal injuries and perform physical feats beyond that of typical Trandoshans. Kephess has become the Dread Masters' &quot;chosen one,&quot; obsessed with spreading terror and violence in their name--but to what end, only the Dread Masters themselves know.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="661238" version="1065353216">While little-known to the population of the greater galaxy, Doctor Sannus Lorrick is a figure of nightmares throughout the Tion Hegemony. Taking advantage of his noble birth and honored position as Royal Science Advisor, Lorrick carried out illegal experiments in gene splicing and viral modification for more than a decade before the horrifying products of his work were discovered. 

Fifteen specimens--twisted, unidentifiable creatures that defied scientific classification--were found locked away in Lorrick's secret personal lab. Although he was arrested immediately, authorities could not prove that the creatures had once been members of any sentient species, so the doctor was acquitted of the heaviest charges laid against him and avoided imprisonment. Instead, he was exiled from the Tion Hegemony and vowed revenge.</text>

Stardream Flight Log \\ Updated by Lieutenant Pursal:

Day 1. Departure from Ord Mantell was on time at 0600 hours. Passenger count is 492, excluding crew and military personnel. Captain Magnus predicts a smooth flight.

Day 5. Flight continues on schedule. Mild cases of food poisoning reported on civilian decks. The kitchen has been notified.

Day 7. The illness has spread. Patients are feverish, violent and inhumanly strong. Ship doctors ruled out food poisoning. Civilian decks One through Five have been quarantined.

Day 9. Captain Magnus has fallen ill. Doctors recommended bed rest, but he accused them of mutiny. Captain Magnus has now locked himself on the bridge and sent the Stardream off-course. 

The passengers are growing violent. The crew is sick, myself included.

Day 12. The Stardream is lost in hyperspace. Infected passengers gather near the ship's radioactive core while the crew readies to stop Captain Magnus and retake control. We will end this.</text>

\\Communication Log of Captain Magnus\\

Amy, guess what? Daddy's flying a ship called the Stardream. A passenger even gave me a stuffed orokeet, just for you! Tell mom to get a cage--I'll see you in a few days.

--

Sorry I missed your call, Yllen. I've been sick. The doctors said it's an allergic reaction, but they weren't stationed on Taris. It's been years, but I swear I recognize the symptoms. Don't tell Amy anything.

--

were working on control, Yllen. The outbreak started on Deck two. Probably by an animal, smething from Ord Mantell that spread the disease to everyone on board. doesn't make any sense

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="661549" version="1065353216">[Careful examination of the infected Sand People tribe's mural reveals a grisly story.]

The paintings portray a third sun crashing into Tatooine. A great evil spills from the wreckage and spreads across the desert.

The mural shows the evil infecting banthas, duneclaws and other creatures of the desert. Then, the darkness spreads to the Sand People.

The pictures grow violent and agitated as they reveal a Sand Person tribe torn apart by infection. Scratchy images show sick Sand People, fever dreams, outbursts of violence and funeral pyres.  

The final image on the mural shows the hopeful figure of a shaman who left the Sand People to find a cure.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="661550" version="1065353216">[An infected Sand People shaman lies dead. His records chronicle the Sand People's quest for a cure to the plague that ravaged their tribe.]

Detailed notes describe the shaman's experiments. Rare desert plants, krayt dragon blood and ancient Sand People remedies were tested.

During his experiments, the shaman contracted the virus from his test subject--an infected bantha. He raced to beat the disease before it destroyed his mind.

The shaman finally found a cure. His antidote restored the infected bantha to health, but it failed to cure the shaman's symptoms--the medicine only saves animals.

In the last entry, the shaman despairs over his failure to save his tribe from the mystifying plague. The remaining records descend into the scrawlings of a mad man.</text>

Note to self: See a medic. Blasted risp bit a chunk out of my leg. Mantellian whisky eases the burn, but I'm down to my last bottle.

Bad time to get sick. Passengers going crazy, no ear plugs--and either I've got another fever dream, or the risp's looking strange.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="690338" version="1065353216">Governing the Chevin homeworld of Vinsoth, the Chevin Conglomerate is a pervasive presence in the galactic underworld, with connections to mercenary groups, Hutts, slavers and other undesirables. However, unlike the Hutts, the businesslike Chevin remain at a distance from the conflict between the Republic and the Sith Empire, as their military might is negligible. The announcement of their Grand Acquisitions Race brought the Chevin into the spotlight, as they offered unmatched riches and power in return for a number of strange items their own agents had been unable to find.

As fortune-seekers and adventurers across the galaxy sought these curiosities, both the Republic and the Empire became curious about the Chevin Conglomerate's motives. Soon the truth was revealed: the items being gathered were intended as a tribute to buy the favor of the Gree, one of the most ancient species in the galaxy. Through their contacts, the Chevin learned that a Gree fleet is returning to known space, bringing not only the normally isolationist aliens but their legendary technology.

Although believed to be non-hostile, the Gree discovered hyperspace travel untold ages ago; a single piece of Gree technology is considered an irreplaceable treasure. For centuries, their influence has been felt only through their emissaries. The reason for their fleet's return is unknown.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="696258" version="1065353216">Gateway world to the Gree Enclave, Asation was the main point of contact between the Gree species and the rest of the galaxy for millennia. The planet closed its borders several centuries ago when the Enclave entered a period of cultural retreat the natives refer to as the &quot;Orange Conic Era.&quot; Originally xenoformed by the Gree thousands of years ago, Asation was populated with primitive creatures developed from various genetic experiments to help sustain the artificial ecosystem.

Asation has three noteworthy landmarks. The first is the ancient trading outpost of Satikan, which is currently closed to visitors. The second notable feature is an eons-old ruined city known only as the &quot;Green Ellipse,&quot; which is forbidden even to the Gree. Lastly, Asation is home to a grand hypergate. This mysterious portal once connected Asation to the rest of the galaxy, but has not seen use since the Orange Conic Era began.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="696259" version="1065353216">Gree Hypergates</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="696259" version="1065353216">Not even the Gree fully understand the mysterious technology known as hypergates. These devices were constructed many millennia ago in a period the Gree reverently call &quot;the most ancient and forgotten days&quot;--a rare instance of their language translating well into Basic. There are numerous hypergates scattered around Gree Enclave space, in varying sizes and states of functionality.

Hypergates resemble freestanding doors or archways. Anyone who steps through an activated hypergate is instantly transported through hyperspace to an opposite hypergate somewhere else. Some hypergates simply move a traveler to a different continent on the same planet, but rumors persist of hypergates capable of sending whole vessels across the galaxy.

Gree culture reveres hypergates as sacred technological works of art. The Enclave's leaders have long maintained that only elite members of the Operator caste known as &quot;gatemasters&quot; know how to activate hypergates. However, the current crisis on Asation may have exposed this as mere cultural bias.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="709781" version="1065353216">The Resolve system protects individual players from having their character repeatedly controlled by enemy players inside Player vs Player combat.

Each character possesses a Resolve resource bar, visible above the character in his or her nameplate, next to the portrait on the targeting window, and in the group window. When a character is the target of an enemy stun, sleep, knockdown, blind, or ballistic effect, that character gains an amount of resolve points. This value is based on the type of effect and its duration, with stronger effects like stun and knockdown generating more resolve than weaker effects like sleeps and blinds. Additionally, if there are control effects currently active on the target, subsequent control effects add a smaller amount of resolve based on the strength and remaining duration of those effects.

Gaining resolve points fills up the character's resolve with a purple bar. Once the resolve bar fills completely up the bar turns white and the character becomes immune to further control effects. When all current control effects expire the resolve bar begins to decay to zero resolve, at which point the character once again can be controlled and the building process starts anew.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="713810" version="1065353216">In the five centuries since its discovery by spice smugglers, the planet Darvannis has existed purely as a navigational footnote on most galactic star charts. Located in the Calaron sector of Hutt Space, the planet lacks any profitable resources or unusual native species. A dense asteroid field makes any approach to the planet a risky venture, so most navigators avoid Darvannis entirely.

This thorough obscurity has made Darvannis a favored retreat for members of the Hutt Cartel looking to avoid attention. Small but prosperous market villas dot the world's arid surface, bustling with vibrant trade in illegal weapons and other black market goods.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="713813" version="1065353216">The GenoHaradan are a secret guild of assassins whose history stretches back before the foundation of the Galactic Republic. Originally serving as secret police in the empire of Xim the Despot, the GenoHaradan became their own masters after Xim's defeat, selling their deadly services to the highest bidder in the decades before the foundation of the Republic.

The leadership of the GenoHaradan recognized the potential for their own organization to thrive under the Republic's loose democracy, and chose to support the fledgling government from the shadows. Though only a select few are aware of them, GenoHaradan agents have continued to eliminate threats to the Republic throughout the Great War, and they remain one of the Republic's most effective allies--although their motivations remain anything but patriotic.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="713814" version="1065353216">The scourge of pirates and smugglers throughout the Outer Rim, Moff Varnus Orlec is the Sith Empire's foremost expert on criminal interdiction and fugitive capture. Where many Imperial officers would view law enforcement duties as a dead-end assignment compared to front line service, Orlec takes tremendous pride in upholding the order of Imperial society even in the depths of wartime.

Despite Orlec's lengthy career of neutralizing underworld activities, only two crime lords have attempted to place a bounty on his head. Both saw their operations obliterated within a matter of weeks. No further bounties have been levelled since that time, and it's unlikely that any of Orlec's numerous criminal enemies will attempt such overt methods again.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="713816" version="1065353216">Vicious predators known for their powerful jaws and thickly scaled hides, kell dragons have become a favorite pet and status symbol among the galaxy's crime lords and collectors of exotic creatures. Almost all currently documented kell dragons were bred in captivity and trained specifically for battle in underworld fighting pits, despite the illegal nature of such activities throughout most of the galaxy. 

Although genetically related to the famed krayt dragons of the planet Tatooine, the homeworld of the smaller kell dragons remains unknown. Some biologists believe the creatures may have been specifically bred from their larger cousins, though how anyone could control the breeding of such colossal and destructive creatures is anyone's guess.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="714711" version="1065353216">The Dread Masters possess incredible, unprecedented power over the dark side of the Force; a power developed through rituals created by one of their own, the incomparable Sith alchemist known as Styrak. Even before Styrak became one of the Dread Masters, his superior intellect and sadistic experiments on subjects both living and dead were infamous. Hundreds, perhaps even thousands of slaves and beasts have been claimed by Styrak's heartless pursuit of mastery over the Force.

Styrak is also the most individualistic of the Dread Masters: whether out of pride or supreme confidence, he is the one most likely to strike out alone in pursuit of the group's goals. Rumors have long suggested that the Dread Masters only possess their full power when acting together, but so far, no one has dared to test the rumor by challenging Styrak during any of his &quot;excursions&quot;.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="726820" version="1065353216">Years before the recent invasion of Belsavis, a lone Imperial warship--the Fatality--launched an apparently suicidal attack on the planet's prison complex. Republic security forces managed to shoot the warship down before it could inflict lasting damage, and the Fatality was believed to have been completely destroyed when it crashed into the area known as Section X. 

In truth, the badly damaged ship had merely sunk into the ice along with its tremendously valuable cargo: a legion of deactivated HK-51 assassin droids, the galaxy's most advanced extermination machines. Although originally programmed to be loyal to the Empire, these inactive droids could almost certainly be repaired and reprogrammed to serve any master....</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732826" version="1065353216">Most who have ever heard the legend of the Shroud believe him to be just that: a legend. But the Shroud is real. Operating through his network of dedicated mercenaries and embedded saboteurs, the freelance superspy is responsible for some of the galaxy's most audacious acts, from the famed &quot;Great Czerka Datacrash&quot; to the toppling of planetary governments. His actions have placed him firmly in the crosshairs of both Republic and Imperial justice systems.

The Shroud doesn't operate out of any particular ideology, but rather out of the pursuit of a grand challenge he can overcome while also evading capture. The net moral result is of no consequence; only the level of difficulty and novelty of the task at hand matter to the brilliant strategist.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732828" version="1065353216">The EV2 discreet reconnaissance macrobinoculars represent the cutting edge in surveillance technology. Supreme-resolution zoom, wide-spectrum environmental analysis, full voice/data communications and an omnioptic interface are but a few of the EV2's top-notch features. These devices are ideal for planetary exploration, environmental observation, data interception, geographic triangulation and target monitoring.

Designed by the legendary freelance superspy known only as &quot;the Shroud,&quot; the EV2s are reportedly named after one of the Shroud's top lieutenants. Components appear to have been contracted separately among several corporations across the galaxy, with the Shroud himself reportedly overseeing their assembly. Anti-tamper explosive charges embedded into the EV2's framework have made reverse engineering this particular model of macrobinoculars unlikely.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732829" version="1065353216">There are many designs of seeker droid in the galaxy, but few can match the versatility and resilience of those models nicknamed &quot;moles&quot; by their users. Subterranean seeker droids are built using the highest-grade durasteel components and programmed for the hazardous task of drilling through soil and rock, surveying the underground area and dredging up any items deemed valuable by its analysis parameters.

Subterranean seeker droids have been used with great success in places as diverse as Tatooine's Dune Sea and Alderaan's Juran Mountains. An especially enterprising scavenger modified her seeker droid for deep-sea drilling and excavation on Manaan. A hungry Firaxan shark swallowed the device whole, but did not live long enough to regret it. The scavenger ate well for several weeks afterwards.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732830" version="1065353216">The Sith Order is constantly seeking ways to fuse dark side power with technology, creating new and terrifying weapons for inflicting terror and despair on the Empire's enemies. One of the greatest practitioners of Sith alchemy, Lord Fulminiss, devoted his life to developing insidious new devices for corrupting other life forms. The subterranean machines code-named &quot;Seeds of Rage&quot; were Fulminiss's crowning achievement.

The Seeds use a combination of low-frequency transmissions and pure dark side power to subtly manipulate the thoughts and emotions of any living creature nearby. Over time, victims of these devices are driven homicidally insane and contaminated by dark side energy. The Seeds can affect intelligent species and beasts with equal success, and rumors persist that these horrific devices can even overwrite the programming logic of droids.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732831" version="1065353216">The Dark Council's official keeper of all things technological, Darth Acina inherited her post after her predecessor Darth Karrid was killed by Republic forces over Duro. Acina was personally tasked by the Emperor's Hand with guarding the Arcanum: a vast storehouse of Sith artifacts and devices deemed too powerful to destroy, but too dangerous for anything but research. Acina controls all access to the Arcanum facility, making her someone the rest of the Dark Council continually seeks to impress. None have discovered what garners Darth Acina's approval--but all agree that to speak with her is always a pleasurable guessing game.

After the Emperor's vanishing, Malgus's betrayal and the rise of the Dread Masters, Darth Acina retreated into watchful seclusion with her apprentices at the Arcanum facility. This proved to be a tactical error, as one of her apprentices had secretly sworn loyalty to the Dread Masters and later organized an impressive raid of the station and its many dark wonders. Her position within the Dark Council has become precarious, forcing her to scramble out of arrogant isolation and curry favor with others.</text>

The Jedi Order tasks its most indomitable masters with hunting down and cleansing such corruption wherever it takes root. Master Cedral Gend is one of the Order's top investigators of such phenomena, having crisscrossed the galaxy many times over in search of artifacts and technology that were created through Sith alchemy.

Master Gend is noteworthy among his fellow Jedi for effortlessly blending in with native populations, quickly mastering their languages and customs. His list of allies--including some within Hutt space and the Empire itself--is impressive. For all his success as a diplomat, however, Master Gend remains a deeply introspective man who retreats into solitude whenever possible. One can only imagine the psychic scars he has gained from a life spent confronting the galaxy's greatest evils.</text>

In the early days of the war, he seized world after world for the expanding Empire and gained a reputation for personally leading charges against Republic defenders. However, once the Empire had established its power and the war began to drag on, Marr found fewer opportunities to leave the Dark Council chambers and directly engage in the fray--a situation that embittered the Sith Lord.

Marr's creed is &quot;Life is the enemy. Death is our solace.&quot; He believes in strife and the glory of conflict, and rumors among his rivals claim that he sees his own death approaching. True or not, Marr carries out his duties with unresigned fury and determination.

With his humanity long forgotten and his face unseen, Marr's inner thoughts are impossible to determine. But his desire to leave a strong Empire behind him is unquestioned, and his abilities are second to none.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732907" version="1065353216">Millennia ago, the Hutt Empire ruled hundreds of star systems. Among its officials were the Archons: part judge, part cultist, chosen to embody and enforce the ancient Hutt ways and maintain the purity of the Hutt Empire against all threats. When the Hutt Empire fell, the Archons faded with it.

For three hundred years, Szajin has served as a &quot;problem solver&quot; inside the Hutt Cartel. Never aspiring to be a crime lord or mogul, never seeking public recognition or luxury beyond the basic extravagances due any Hutt, Szajin has long enjoyed the shadowy games of manipulation needed to maintain the Cartel's power.

But Szajin desires a return to greatness for his people. To this end, he has reclaimed the title of Archon and serves as a secret advisor to the Cartel's leaders. Szajin is determined to see the return of a great Hutt Empire and take pride in his species once more.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732913" version="1065353216">Mission Type: Acquisition and Exfiltration
Operational Zone: Makeb
Prepared for: Darth Marr
Distribution List: Classified

Strike team is charged with procuring Makeb's isotope-5 stockpile under outside command. By request of Darth Marr, primary qualifications for strike team members include high loyalty levels and a psychological state amenable to a suicide mission.

Team member specializations include communications, coordination, observation and stealth. Can be augmented with scientific expertise should the mission requirements change.

Katha Niar (Ministry of Logistics) and Lord Cytharat (on temporary release from Korriban jails) will act in secondary leadership roles. Niar's recent work with the Imperial Army has resulted in highly successful operations (but note high casualty rates). Profiling suggests that Cytharat's desire for redemption is genuine, and he will ably protect his team. 

Should mission prove successful, survivors may be reassigned together for future operations.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="732914" version="1065353216">Isotope-5</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732914" version="1065353216">A mineral unknown in the rest of the galaxy, isotope-5 was secretly discovered during Hutt-backed deep-core mining operations on the planet Makeb. Named for the fifth known isotopic variation of an element normally found in neutron stars, isotope-5 has powerful warping effects on gravitational and electromagnetic fields even in miniscule quantities. 

Early research into isotope-5's potential as an energy source is extraordinarily promising. The substance is relatively stable, and particle bombardment could theoretically induce a desired state in the isotope to channel various forms of energy.

Best estimates put the total amount of isotope-5 in Makeb's core at less than two tonnes. Nonetheless, it is highly likely that Makeb's atmospheric interference and unusual mesa formations are a result of the isotope's presence.

The existence of isotope-5 is highly classified. Only select Imperial personnel, high-ranking Hutt Cartel members and Makeb natives directly involved with its mining are believed to be aware of its existence.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="732915" version="1065353216">History of Makeb</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732915" version="1065353216">Located off major hyperspace routes, Makeb went unnoticed until the Mandalorian Wars, when a damaged transport ship carrying Republic refugees--including wealthy businessmen fleeing raiders--crash-landed there. Led by magnate Semako Thalien, the survivors built settlements and re-established contact with the galaxy. Rich mineral deposits in Makeb's mesas, combined with the settlers' credits and influence, made it an immensely profitable world within fifty years.

Makeb's wealth and independence from the Republic attracted corporate leaders, rich tourists and banking enterprises, and luxury resorts quickly became commonplace. The Hutt Cartel took notice of a new economic power and attempted to invest its own resources, but was rebuffed by Makeb's business consortiums. Nevertheless, individual Hutts persisted in working their way into Makeb society, laying the groundwork for conquest.

During the war between the Empire and the Republic, Makeb stubbornly retained its independence. Rumors claim that a vast deposit of minerals was discovered soon after the Treaty of Coruscant, but details are surprisingly scarce.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="732916" version="1065353216">Atmosphere of Makeb</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732916" version="1065353216">Makeb's wealthy citizens have spent millions of credits trying to solve the problem of the planet's peculiar atmospheric conditions. High levels of electromagnetic interference in Makeb's upper atmosphere wreak havoc on communications and destroy any ship much larger than a personal shuttle. The interference was responsible for the original transport crash that brought Makeb's settlers to the planet. It also rendered the transport's communications equipment useless, cutting off Makeb from the rest of the galaxy.

Although Makeb engineers eventually devised a reliable communication system that compensates for the interference, traveling through the atmosphere is still incredibly dangerous. In the early days of Makeb's colonization, daredevil pilots calling themselves the Lightning Runners built specialized fliers from salvage and attempted to navigate the skies. While many died, the data they gathered eventually showed patterns in the interference, which modern Makeb shuttle pilots exploit to safely transport passengers and cargo in small quantities.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732917" version="1065353216">The tide has turned in the battle for galactic control between the Republic and the Empire. Weakened by Sith infighting and a rebellion staged by Darth Malgus, the Empire stares down a unified Republic front and the possibility of defeat. Commanded by leaders such as Darth Marr, Imperial forces have withdrawn from many areas of conflicted space and loosened their grip on outlying worlds in a strategic move to shore up defenses, regroup and prepare for retaliation. 

As the Empire stages its tactical retreat, the heartened Republic presses its advantage. United under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Saresh, Republic forces rally and unleash bold new tactics against the shaken Empire. But a Republic victory is far from assured. The Empire's will to survive is unassailable, and it will stop at nothing to combat the Republic's aggressions and conquer the galaxy.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732918" version="1065353216">The rebellion of Malgus the Betrayer struck a decisive blow to the Imperial war effort, weakening the Empire's offensive and shattering its united front. Alien factions that flocked to Malgus's banner would forever be judged for their disloyalty. But in a time of turmoil, those species that remained faithful were rewarded.

Against the protests of its more conservative leaders--including heated objections from Grand Moff Regus--the Empire began a concerted effort to integrate its most devoted alien subjects into the military. Only by increasing its numbers with alien stock could the Empire survive the raging conflict against the Republic.

The new alien recruits face down prejudice and competition to prove their worth and secure power within the evolving Empire. Cathar clans have vaulted to prominence, while Kaleesh tribes and countless other species pledge their support to the Imperial fight. Fueled by these brave and committed alien warriors, the Empire rallies its strength and marches into a new era.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732919" version="1065353216">The Hutt Cartel's wealthiest and most influential leaders were abandoned to die with the planet Makeb when their paranoid ally Toborro accused them of plotting behind his back. To save themselves, these Hutts signed a binding treaty that made them official Republic allies. The Hutt Cartel is now obligated to lend its considerable resources to the Republic's cause.

This alliance has been met with skepticism and outright hostility by the Cartel's lesser members, none of whom were endangered by events on Makeb and therefore had no reason to accept the treaty's terms. How these rancorous Cartel members will respond to Republic demands remains to be seen. In the meantime, the famous Hutt scientist Doctor Oggurobb now works as an official liaison between the Republic and Cartel leaders--a position he finds annoying in the extreme.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="732921" version="1065353216">Toborro the Hutt</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="732921" version="1065353216">The ruthless and paranoid Hutt known as Toborro has led his fellow Cartel members on a campaign to carve out their own galactic empire, starting on the planet Makeb. Toborro believes it is his people's mandate--and, more specifically, his destiny--to end this foolish war between the Republic and Empire. He does not tolerate failure in his subordinates and is constantly watching for signs of betrayal from his allies.

Toborro is clever, brutal and willing to eliminate an entire planet's population to achieve his ambitions. As Toborro put it in a fiery speech to his fellow Cartel leaders: &quot;For too long, we have bent over backwards doing business with both sides, when these lesser factions are mere insects compared to our glorious and long-lived people! Why should we bother negotiating with creatures who are only fit to be slaves?&quot;</text>

The Regulators, as they are more commonly known, have conducted successful military operations on dozens of neutral worlds. They accepted an exclusive contract ten years ago to provide planet-wide security services for Makeb.

The Hutt Cartel's leaders bribed several high-ranking Regulators to betray Makeb's rightful government and help the Hutts stage a coup. Many rank-and-file Regulators refused to accept the buyout offer, but were either shot by their corrupt comrades or forced to flee the planet. Once respected and trusted by Makeb's people, the Regulators are now regarded as thugs for hire.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733006" version="1065353216">Due to Makeb's dangerous atmospheric conditions, moving passengers and goods to and from the planet's surface can be hazardous if not disastrous. Hoping to circumvent the danger, Makeb's mining corporations constructed the gravity hooks: orbital stations connected to the surface by tremendously long turbolift shafts and repulsorlifts.

Although the project succeeded in creating a safe alternative for moving cargo on- and offworld, the gravity hooks' low transit speed, meager carrying capacity and high energy costs have limited their use to industrial purposes. Many of the gravity hooks have fallen into disuse in recent years, especially as starship modifications that reduce the danger of atmospheric flight become more widely available.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733017" version="1065353216">Constructed in the heady days of Makeb's early mining boom, Stronghold One was designed to be an impenetrable fortress for the planet's treasury. The facility is submerged in a roiling lava pool inside a volcanic mesa, with only one surface access point and six separate layers of internal security defenses.

If the mercenaries manning Stronghold One's defenses had been loyal, the Hutt Cartel might never have gotten inside, but Makeb's rich treasury was handed over to the Hutts with the same casual ease as the rest of the planet. Now, in addition to holding the bulk of Makeb's monetary wealth, Stronghold One is believed to house the planet's ultimate treasure: the Hutt Cartel's entire supply of isotope-5.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733022" version="1065353216">Makeb has always suffered from periodic groundquakes--notable given that the planet's population lives on high, isolated mesas--but recently the quakes have been more frequent, causing severe damage to Makeb's cities. The cause, as has now been discovered, is the Hutts' aggressive deep-core mining operations. 

Projections show that, barring a miracle, the groundquakes will increase in severity, collapsing the mesas and causing volcanic eruptions. Strange fluctuations in Makeb's gravitational and electromagnetic fields are occurring as well. If present trends continue, violent storms will wrack the planet, and its gravity will become too weak to retain an atmosphere at all. 

If Makeb's crust survives, the planet will be left barren and lifeless; if not, nothing will be left of Makeb but floating debris. Without a swift and thorough evacuation, Makeb will suffer one of the worst humanitarian crises in galactic history.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="733023" version="1065353216">Mining on Makeb</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733023" version="1065353216">Since Makeb's initial settlement, the mining industry has been at the heart of life on the planet. When valuable minerals were discovered in Makeb's mesas, the first settlers--stranded and unable to communicate with the Republic--were forced to improvise mining tools to extract them. Some wealthy citizens like to boast that their ancestors dug up fortunes with their bare hands.

Today, Makeb's miners use huge laser drills to reach valuable minerals deep beneath the surface. Once the laser has bored a shaft, a gravity funnel draws the resulting material up to the mining station. Automated systems inside the station sift the ore and begin the initial stages of processing.

Since Makeb's mines often bore into the heart of the planet or take advantage of existing volcanic vents, the operators have developed sophisticated heat-shielding technology. Marketing these shields has been almost as lucrative as the mining itself.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733024" version="1065353216">The Supreme Chancellor of the Republic serves as both political arbiter and leader of the free galaxy--and no one is better suited to the honor than Leontyne Saresh. 

Enslaved by the Empire as a young child, the charismatic, ambitious and fiercely intelligent Saresh escaped her captors to become a passionate opponent of Imperial injustices. After Imperial forces sacked the Republic capital of Coruscant to end the war, Saresh launched an illustrious political career that would win her a seat on the Republic Senate, governorship of Taris and a fearless reputation.

When war erupted again, Saresh was elected by the Senate to replace Supreme Chancellor Janarus. Surrounded by ardent supporters and loyal political allies, she delivered an impassioned speech on the steps of the Senate tower calling for the eradication of the Sith Empire. Saresh's rousing words inspired millions and gave birth to a new age in which the Republic would stop at nothing to win the conflict and ensure the galaxy's freedom.</text>

As mining interests expanded and enriched Makeb's economy over the years, the locals made a special effort to keep industrial activities separated from their capital, which grew into a center for the world's banking, technological and artistic endeavors.

Unfortunately, Talaos City has suffered extensive damage from the groundquakes caused by the Hutt Cartel's reckless mining operations. The Hutts' invasion has only worsened the situation, with locals afraid to leave their homes and businesses for fear of the mercenary patrols that enforce martial law.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733029" version="1065353216">As a rich, independent world, Makeb has always had an irresistible lure for the Hutt Cartel. Eventually, a consortium led by the powerful Toborro the Hutt laid plans to seize control of the planet's mineral wealth. A terrible groundquake that leveled one of Makeb's cities gave the Hutt Cartel its chance. 

In the confusion, the Hutts brought a fleet to Makeb. Once the ships arrived, Makeb's mercenary forces--having been secretly paid off by the Hutt Cartel--rose up and turned against Makeb's citizens. The mercenaries took over the government's buildings and helped select Hutt forces land. Although mining operations and businesses still run as normal, the Hutts have the hold on Makeb they have wanted for years.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733030" version="1065353216">Travelers in Makeb's wilderness may be tempted to make camp on small, inviting hillocks, not realizing that they are actually the backs of makrin creepers. These enormous beasts possess bark-like skin--actually cords of muscle--and grass-like nerve-rich tissues that blend in perfectly with their environment. Normally docile, makrin creepers can lash out with thick claws if attacked, disabling their attackers before crushing them to death. 

Many tourists to Makeb are fascinated by makrin creepers. Some unscrupulous souvenir vendors have been caught selling tree branches as &quot;creeper trophies.&quot;</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733031" version="1065353216">Although currently abundant, the strikingly patterned vrakes were on the verge of extinction for more than a hundred years. An enterprising Makeb scientist, Kaylah Taprish, took a liking to the creatures--she claimed their faces reminded her of her favorite uncle--and spent five years studying and crossbreeding them before releasing a dozen new colonies into the wild. Unfortunately, with their numbers increased, vrakes have now become fiercely territorial.

The head crest of a vrake resembles the face of another Makeb predator, the thunderhead hawk. Vrakes use the crest to startle prey--usually birds and small rodents--for the rest of their colony to pounce on.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733032" version="1065353216">When a group of Makeb's early settlers explored the planet's underground caves, they encountered a vicious burrowing animal they named the exoboar. Surprisingly fast and armored with blaster-resistant leathery skin, the exoboars ripped up equipment and drove the settlers back until Sarthon Quis, a former career bodyguard, figured out that the boars were repelled by a particular herb growing in the caves. Rubbing the herb on their clothes allowed the settlers to pass safely. 

In later years, Sarthon Quis became an acclaimed hunter of exoboars and even had a set of armor made from exoboar hide. Unfortunately, he wore it while on an expedition into even deeper caves and was devoured by a subteroth who took him for a particularly plump boar.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733033" version="1065353216">It is widely suspected that Makeb's recent groundquakes leveled a major pterathki nest, since these strangely elegant creatures have been seen flying over Talaos City in increasing numbers. Pterathkis normally hunt small animals, using their unusual tails to attract prey before spearing them with stabs of their powerful beaks.

Although there is little meat on a pterathki, they are known to be particularly delicious to the Hutt palate when basted in Dantooine cane syrup. Since Makeb's takeover, Hutt Cartel forces have been seen attempting to net pterathkis for their masters' tables--and earning scars from angry pterathki beaks.</text>

When a transport ship carrying the first settlers crash-landed three hundred years ago, a breeding pair of pedigree yaras in the cargo hold managed to escape and quickly adapted to Makeb's wilderness. 

Yaras are highly adept swimmers, either hunting fish or lurking underwater to ambush their prey. Recent changes in Makeb's climate have driven them onto land, where they have found sentients to be a perfectly acceptable meal. There is some talk of domesticating the yaras, but centuries of running wild have made them a dangerous prospect as pets.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733035" version="1065353216">Subteroths linger in the nightmares of every Makeb explorer. Armored, muscular and utterly deadly, these hulking beasts typically live in deep underground caverns, where their eyes have atrophied over time. Instead, subteroths hunt using scent and the crest on the back of their head, a hypersensitive organ that picks up the electromagnetic fields of a prey's heartbeat and transmits it directly to the subteroth's nervous system.

Makeb's recent groundquakes have driven the subteroths out of their normal hunting grounds and toward the surface. Being surrounded by an abundance of prey and curious interlopers has driven the already-lethal subteroths into a feeding frenzy.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733038" version="1065353216">&quot;Underwalker&quot; is the Makeb nickname for a species of subterranean insectoid carnivores. The shell of an underwalker is astonishingly resilient and shares the properties of some of Makeb's ores. Biologists believe that the underwalkers may have mutated over millennia of drinking water contaminated by mineral deposits.

Whatever they once were, underwalkers are a constant menace to Makeb's mining engineers because underwalker territory is often around the richest seams of mineral wealth. More than one underwalker has been sighted with tools lodged in its carapace: the sign of tragic events occurring around a newly bored drill shaft.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733039" version="1065353216">Sharing a family tree with the more aggressive vrakes, barbed ginxes are relatively harmless, curious amphibians that frequent Makeb's marshes. Their name comes from the barbed &quot;thumb&quot; they use to peel off bark from trees or fallen logs while looking for insects to eat. Dep Aila, the first scientist to document the barbed ginx, encountered them when he left his speeder unattended and came back to find a small horde of ginx had peeled off the exterior casing, hoping to find food.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733040" version="1065353216">As a young Imperial cadet, Arribid Bensen took every opportunity to eschew soldiering and excel in the sciences. Eventually becoming an expert in geotechnical engineering, Bensen leapt at the opportunity to oversee construction of a complex system of bridges over a particularly hazardous marsh on Dromund Kaas. Bensen railed against the existing design, noting a key weakness at its foundation. His concerns were ignored, but when rebel slaves eventually exploited that very weakness, leveling the entire bridge system, Bensen became a crucial voice of reason.

Bensen has since travelled the galaxy as a consultant, pointing out the geological weaknesses of military installations and enemy targets alike. Bensen was most recently dispatched to Makeb to oversee the sensitive task of extracting mass quantities of isotope-5 from the dying planet. He was also given the new rank of &quot;Under-Moff&quot; in recognition of his unique importance.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733041" version="1065353216">As Republic forces rocketed away from Makeb with millions of refugees, one thing was certain: the planet was doomed to total destruction. In the aftermath, however, it appears that Makeb's groundquakes and volcanic eruptions have drastically subsided. Against all odds, the planet has stabilized and remains capable of supporting life... for now, at least.

The exact cause of Makeb's abrupt recovery may never be known, but the planet's continued existence makes it hotly-contested territory in the war between Republic and Empire. Before either faction can claim the world, they will first have to defeat the Hutt's mercenary soldiers, who were left to die by their former masters and now claim the world as their own. With its vast mineral resources and abandoned wealth up for grabs, Makeb is a valuable prize worth fighting over.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="733044" version="1065353216">Isotope-5 Droids</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733044" version="1065353216">The mineral isotope-5 is the Hutt Cartel's key to technological advances that will make it the galaxy's undisputed military superpower. Scientists speculate that a single microgram of isotope-5 is enough to power a large datapad for an entire century. The Hutts are not interested in such peaceful applications, however.

Unbeknownst to Makeb's rightful government, Hutt-employed scientists have designed and manufactured advanced war droids unlike anything the galaxy has seen. These isotope-5 droids are powered by fuel rods that generate impressive energy shields and devastating blaster fire.

Toborro the Hutt has deployed isotope-5 droids to attack civilian settlements and resistance forces. Although these early models are clearly &quot;expendable&quot; prototype designs, they are remarkably effective. Toborro is likely holding even more advanced isotope-5 droids in reserve.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="733045" version="1065353216">The Ark</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733045" version="1065353216">Hidden within the Giant's Spear mesa is the answer to surviving the devastation of Makeb: a gigantic starship with vast holds that could contain millions of people, known as the Ark. The Ark project has suffered from delays and mismanagement thanks to its corrupt foreman, Veedrig, and is still not quite spaceworthy.

Although the Ark seems enormous while it is empty, transporting millions of frightened refugees to safety will be a logistical nightmare. Bringing basic food, water and medical supplies will necessitate packing people like cargo. Nevertheless, with no options left, transports and caravans are already being sent to evacuate Makeb's residential districts and bring people to the Ark.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="733046" version="1065353216">The Avesta Family</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="733046" version="1065353216">The Avesta family legacy stretches back to Makeb's founding centuries ago, when a refugee starship crash-landed on the planet. The earliest Avestas were hardy merchant explorers who established a series of profitable settlements across their new homeworld. Eventually, the family created the Avesta Mining Corporation and led Makeb's Business Council in negotiating successful trade partnerships with the Republic and Hutt Cartel.

When the InterStellar Regulators' mercenaries betrayed Makeb's leaders and aided the Hutt Cartel's takeover, most of the Avesta family evacuated offworld. A handful remained to resist the Hutts: Shalim Avesta organizes a rebellion and enlists the Republic's aid, while his younger brother Pollus actively leads armed fighters to retake key positions. Their niece, stridently anti-mining geophysicist Lemda Avesta, had been a family embarrassment until this crisis made her knowledge invaluable to discovering the source of Makeb's groundquakes.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="735610" version="1065353216">Composed of survivors and outcasts from dozens of defunct pirate groups from around the galaxy, the Tonvarr have banded together under a simple Weequay battle principle: &quot;Enter with the best weapons, leave with the best spoils.&quot; Tonvarr raiding parties have struck weapon manufacturing centers, xenotechnology research labs, and even ancient dig sites, gathering the most impressive arsenal of advanced and exotic weapons technologies in the entire galactic underworld. 

The group's intelligence gathering abilities are also far beyond the level of other pirate organizations; no one is entirely sure how the Tonvarr have the expertise to locate and make use of such a wide variety of complex technologies. It's possible that their broad knowledge is a side effect of the group's diverse membership: raiders from many different species have been spotted among the Tonvarr ranks.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="735611" version="1065353216">The mysterious Gree starship known as Gray Secant carries a long and unclear history. According to the Gree, this fully-automated vessel was launched by their ancestors at some point in the distant past, though conventional sensor technology has been unable to determine the ship's precise age or even its composition. As a result, there is no way to know the ancient starship's capabilities for certain, though most experts believe its technological sophistication to be well beyond contemporary Republic and Imperial science.

Among the Gree themselves, Gray Secant carries an almost religious significance. The ship was sent out from the Gree Enclave to explore and analyze the rest of the galaxy over the course of many millennia; getting to see one of their ancient legends at work firsthand is understandably exciting for the Gree.</text>

Established in ancient times, the Great Hunt is a Mandalorian contest of skill and glory overseen by the venerable Wookiee Huntmaster. Though the clans had been scattered, there was an attempt to keep the Great Hunt and its traditions alive. However, during one Great Hunt, the Mandalorians were surprised to see a droid among the competitors--an utterly unprecedented event.

After questioning the droid--an obsolete construction model--the Huntmaster overrode objections from conservative hunters and allowed its entry. The nameless droid proceeded to outwit and out-gun its way to victory in the Great Hunt.

When the droid returned to claim its title as champion, more arguments ensued. Ression Trana, a prominent clan leader, claimed loudly that a droid champion mocked Mandalorian traditions. The droid listened patiently until Trana accused it of being a proxy for a cowardly hunter. Without hesitation, the droid kicked Ression Trana, mid-sentence, through a window. In the aftermath, the droid earned not only the title of Grand Champion, but also its nickname: &quot;the Defenestrator&quot;.</text>

One of the Sith Emperor's mightiest weapons in the Great War was also one of his oldest: six ancient Sith Lords known as the Dread Masters who had served the Emperor for centuries. Meditating in unison, they could inflict crippling fear to shatter enemy armies' morale, causing Republic troop formations to abandoned their allies mid-battle, and sending entire battle fleets running blindly into hyperspace.

Slowly, the Jedi pieced together the truth of these events. They joined forces with an elite Republic Special Forces unit, who stole the security codes for the Dread Masters' heavily-guarded dreadnaught. Hijacking an Imperial Moff's personal yacht, a Republic strike team boarded the dreadnaught and, aided by Jedi Master Jaric Kaedan, captured the Dread Masters. The dreadnaught was rigged for self-destruct to cover the strike team's escape.

The Republic officially announced that the Dread Masters had been killed, even as the Jedi secretly arranged their imprisonment on Belsavis. However, the loss of the Dread Masters antagonized the Dark Council, and may have contributed to the Empire's decision to attack Alderaan.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="758501" version="1065353216">To rise into the upper echelons of a galactic-scale operation such as the Czerka Corporation is nigh impossible. But for Rasmus Blys, it was inevitable. The son of humble farmers, Blys relied on his intellect, single-minded determination and ruthless nature to earn the title of Special Executive.

The crowning achievement in Blys' career: CZ-198, the one-time storage outpost he repurposed to become Czerka's flagship research center. It's a weapons-manufacturing empire that few can claim to rival--one that Special Executive Blys has no intention of relinquishing anytime soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="758502" version="1065353216">CZ-198</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="758502" version="1065353216">In its heyday, Czerka Corporation bought up all the land it could manage--including entire moons. While some of these moons were purchased to exploit their abundant mineral deposits, most were turned into massive warehouses for excess manufacturing parts and inventory. One such storage facility was designated CZ-198.

Czerka Special Executive Rasmus Blys, thrilled with its remote locale, handpicked CZ-198 to become home to his new research projects. Over the years that followed, CZ-198 grew into a major profit center for Czerka, developing and manufacturing cutting-edge droids and weapons. Due to the facility's top-secret nature, it is unclear whether Czerka's executive board was aware that CZ-198's Green Habitat Zone biomes were built for Blys' ultimate goal: to gauge the effects of foreign environments on creatures and beings that have been forcibly mutated and enhanced into weapons of war.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="758509" version="1065353216">Fierce, ravenous, and seemingly primitive, the Flesh Raiders of Tython instill fear like few other sentient species--and for good reason. The Vigilant, however, is far more than any mere Flesh Raider.

Commissioned by Special Executive Rasmus Blys, the Vigilant is a merciless combination of nature and technology designed for the sole purpose of protecting CZ-198 and its many secrets. When an attempt to infiltrate CZ-198 by a corporate saboteur resulted in the collateral deaths of more than four dozen Czerka employees, Blys was forced to outfit the Vigilant with stricter restraint protocols. Still, with the facility's formidable defenses hardwired to the Vigilant's enhanced brain, it is easily the deadliest living creation in Czerka's arsenal.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="763430" version="1065353216">Located in an unremarkable system well off the Hydian Way, Oricon seems an almost arbitrary choice for the Dread Masters' home. But anyone with an affinity for the Force can sense that the rocky Outer Rim moon is immeasurably strong with the dark side. Perhaps this is because the legendary Phobis devices are housed on Oricon; perhaps the Phobis devices were built on the moon long ago because of the dark side's preexistence there.

The once-lifeless orb now brims with creatures from across the galaxy, corrupted and driven to frenzy by the Dread Masters' dark experiments. It has also become a starship graveyard, as Republic and Imperial fleets poised to attack the Dread Masters' fortress, torn apart by waves of madness and fear, crashed to the surface. There can be no doubt that Oricon is now one of the most hazardous destinations in the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="763431" version="1065353216">Sergeant Trila</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="763431" version="1065353216">With a reputation for being tough, smart and full of bluster, Sergeant Tanye Trila has been barking orders on major battlefronts throughout the galaxy, from Mannett Point on Ord Mantell to Corellia's Axial Park.

The operation on Oricon represents Sergeant Trila's third encounter with the Dread Masters: she was on Belsavis during their initial escape and served as military support in the aftermath of their machinations on Denova. However, it remains to be seen whether she can withstand the waves of Phobis-induced madness on Oricon.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="763432" version="1065353216">Lord Hargrev</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="763432" version="1065353216">Fear, pain and power: these are the intense obsessions of the singularly odd Lord Hargrev. Seen by many of his peers as deranged and self-indulgent, Hagrev was often overlooked as a serious Sith lord, never being considered for the title of Darth. 

Since the Dread Masters began their recent campaign of terror, Hargrev has been surprised to find himself in high demand. With his thorough understanding of the Dread Masters and the Phobis devices they control, it is the Sith Empire's hope that Hargrev will rise to the occasion and help win the day on Oricon.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="763434" version="1065353216">Dread Master Bestia</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="763434" version="1065353216">Perhaps the most powerful of the Dread Masters, Bestia first made a name for herself when, as a Sith apprentice, she singlehandedly crushed a slave rebellion on Ziost. This accomplishment brought her to the attention of the Emperor, who invited her to join a group of Sith to study the ancient and powerful Phobis devices. These Sith would become the Dread Masters.

Bestia was the Dread Master responsible for bringing the Masters' prophecies and insights to the Emperor's attention whenever necessary, and also for ensuring the Emperor's commands were carried out. Having learned of the Emperor's fate, she now harbors great contempt for the Empire. And with the loss of Dread Master Styrak, Bestia has become all the more spiteful. She would gladly see the galaxy crumble, even if the Dread Masters were to go with it.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="763435" version="1065353216">Dread Master Brontes</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="763435" version="1065353216">Long ago, when the Dread Masters began their investigation of the Phobis devices, Brontes led the research, risking her own sanity in the process. She is a consummate scholar and Force adept, generally accepted as the wisest of the Dread Masters in lore and ancient secrets. 

Much about Brontes has been forgotten by the other Dread Masters--and even Brontes herself. It is known, however, that Brontes had been a major contributor to the Sith Academy archives, and her insights into the nature and purpose of sacred artifacts led to the construction of the Dark Temple.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="763437" version="1065353216">Dread Master Calphayus</text>

For centuries, his visions of what might come to pass spared the Sith Empire from slave rebellions, Republic ambushes and internal disruptions many times over.

As Calphayus sees the threads of many futures that might come to pass at any one time, it can be difficult for most to comprehend his insights. However, one certainty that always emerges from Calphayus' visions is that the Dread Masters will ultimately reign supreme.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="763438" version="1065353216">Dread Master Raptus</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="763438" version="1065353216">If one Dread Master embodies the group's collective voice, it's Raptus. Darkly eloquent and persuasive, he is known for manipulating through words, convincing others to lose all sense of hope or reason, or to even act against their very natures. While the captured Dread Masters were in transit to Belsavis, Raptus compelled a trio of hardened Republic soldiers to end their own lives by simply talking to them.

Raptus is the one Dread Master most likely to address outsiders. With his coldly arrogant demeanor, he doesn't suffer fools for long; those who do not kneel or offer a gift to the Dread Masters will quickly be taught a harsh lesson in manners.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="763440" version="1065353216">One of the most perceptive Dread Masters, Tyrans is never one to act without a plan in place. &quot;Speak little and listen much&quot; is his creed; he prefers to take measure of his opponents before he engages them, employing complex strategies to take advantage of their weaknesses. One of Tyrans' favored tactics is to use his insights to set his enemies at each other's throats.

Tyrans was largely responsible for the design of the Dread Fortress, ensuring that the complex would provide maximum security--not that he's afraid of a straightforward confrontation. As with the other Dread Masters, Tyrans is a formidable foe who will gladly display his impressive mastery of the dark side of the Force when needed.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="763443" version="1065353216">The Dread Fortress</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="763443" version="1065353216">Centuries ago, a group of Sith lords were sent to Oricon to study the arcane and powerful Phobis devices. When these Sith reemerged from their work as the Dread Masters, they did so with the intent of making Oricon their home. With the Emperor's blessing, they transported thousands upon thousands of slaves to the moon to build a massive fortress. 

Surrounded by deep pools of fiery lava, the fortress protects against all would-be invaders. Its impenetrable gates, powerful droids, and vicious, corrupted monstrosities guard a towering palace that contains the Dread Masters' private chambers, where the Masters practice their dark arts. Once construction was completed, the Dread Masters used the fortress compound to expend their slaves in experiments designed to test the limits of the Phobis devices, and to explore the outermost boundaries of fear.</text>

Dissatisfied with the peaceful and quiet ways of her people, Treek is determined to achieve great things with her life. She travels the galaxy as a mercenary soldier, always on the hunt for new horizons and epic challenges to conquer. Despite hailing from a technologically-archaic planet and species, Treek has adapted quickly to civilized space.

Treek is unconcerned with material possessions or personal power. Her only goal is to forge a legacy that will outlive her. In Treek's mind, the greatest defeat is to be forgotten. She will do whatever it takes to ensure her name and deeds will be celebrated long after she is gone.

For a time, wealthy executives and socialites flocked to the planet to enjoy its remote locale, comfortable climate and exotic vistas without any need for concern over political entanglements. Even the more frequent occurrence of groundquakes in recent years could not place a dent in Makeb's prosperous tourism, banking and mining trades.

Recent events, however, have changed matters for the worse. With its precarious position on the edge of Hutt Space, Makeb has drawn the attention of the Hutt Cartel. Just what the Hutts intend for the planet remains to be seen.</text>
		<text bitflag="65" id1="1" id2="769933" version="1065353216">The second of two species discovered by Jarn Harvus on Nim Drovis, the harvorisk is actually no relation to the similarly named harvap. Shortly after its discovery, the harvorisk was coveted by Hutts across the galaxy, who considered it alternately an exotic new pet and a tasty meal. But its rapid rate of breeding and vicious, untrainable personality quickly led to the Hutts' becoming disenchanted with their new pets, causing the release of many harvorisks into the wild. This is a test to continue and see if this is properly updated.

On Quesh, it was the Three Families who brought harvorisks to the planet and genetically modified the creatures so they might survive in the toxic atmosphere--albeit at a cost of half their lifespan. The Hutts refuse to accept responsibility for the creatures' escape, but the harvorisks have begun reproducing, seeking prey among the planet's miners.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="772723" version="1065353216">Whenever an outbreak of the rakghoul virus surfaces anywhere in the galaxy, one of the first distress calls is made to The Hyland Organization for Rakghoul Neutralization (THORN). With its vast resources and singular mission--the permanent eradication of the rakghoul threat--THORN is a planet's best chance of avoiding a global pandemic.

To most citizens of the galaxy, this philanthropic organization created by entrepreneur Addalar Hyland is a welcome force for good. Few, however, are aware of the reason for Hyland's support of THORN as opposed to any other charitable cause. While he would never discuss it in public, it is a matter of record that Hyland lost two of his children to an outbreak of the rakghoul plague on Tatooine. Ever since that fateful day, he has diverted a great deal of his wealth earned from Galactic Solutions Industries to personally finance THORN.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="772724" version="1065353216">The Rakghoul Tunnels</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="772724" version="1065353216">While it's clear that the rakghoul virus initially spreads across the surface of a given planet, it has been difficult to determine the point of origin because the greatest density of rakghouls is not aboveground, but rather deep underground. Researchers attempting to understand why rakghouls congregate below a given planet's surface rather than above have developed a theory: that the subterranean tunnels in which the rakghouls gather are not found, but are actually created by the rakghouls themselves.

Careful study of the tunnels has revealed striking similarities in contour and dimension reminiscent of the natural algorithmic optimizations witnessed in the configuration of killik hives of Alderaan and in the formation of blood-ant mounds on Tatooine. Furthermore, the familiar distribution of spore sacs and unique flora suggest not only an attempt to create an environment conducive to their habitation, but also a robust fungal signature stored within the virus's genetic code. It is the hope of THORN researchers that unlocking the key to the creation of these tunnels will also provide insight into stopping the rakghoul menace for good.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="772725" version="1065353216">The Spike</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="772725" version="1065353216">When a mining crew drilled into what they had thought was a prothium gas pocket, the first underground network of rakghoul tunnels was discovered. Since then, direct routes have not been found into these densely populated tunnels that happen to correspond with rakghoul outbreaks. To access such networks in an efficient and timely manner, THORN founder Addalar Hyland introduced The Spike: a massive, cylindrical pulse hammer that quickly displaces soil and rock to form a temporary turbolift shaft leading directly into the rakghouls' subterranean lairs.

Originally developed by Galactic Solutions Industries to fire troop deployments deep into sub-crustal enemy bunkers, the effects of The Spike's ground-busting payload were deemed too violent for those within to survive the turbulence, making the costly apparatus less than desirable to prospective buyers. In its new role as a facilitator between rakghouls and those who wish to dispose of them, The Spike has found great success.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="772726" version="1065353216">Rakghoul Propagation</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="772726" version="1065353216">It has long been thought that the only way for the rakghoul virus to spread was by turning other beings into rakghouls through infection, but close studies of underground rakghoul habitats now point to a more complicated and unsettling reality: that rakghouls can propagate without the need for turning.

Located deep below the surface of infected planets, small rakghouls have been found roaming together in packs. These &quot;raklings&quot; appear to have been formed from luminescent spore sacs strung along the rakghoul tunnels, though it is not yet clear to biologists how this process works. They have learned, however, that the raklings are attracted to a particular pheromone emitted from certain flora found within the tunnels. Researchers have long wished to use this pheromone to lure raklings into captivity, but strict antiviral protocols enacted by THORN do not allow these proto-rakghouls to be taken aboveground. Until they can be tested in a proper laboratory setting, the truth of how rakghouls self-multiply may not be fully understood.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="772843" version="1065353216">As Core Founders of the Galactic Republic, the people of Kuat aspired to provide a vital service to their newly formed government. To this end, they set out to build one of the galaxy's largest starship manufacturing companies. Kuat Drive Yards provides Republic-aligned planets with short-range shuttles, orbital stations and interplanetary transports. More crucially, they supply the Republic Navy with many of the components of its fleets, from the smallest single-person starfighters to capital warships.

Kuat Drive Yards quickly grew from a small series of shipyards, docks and warehouses in orbit over Kuat into an interconnected ring of manufacturing excellence. From the surface of the planet, the sight of the yards arcing across the sky brings the Kuati people a constant sense of duty and purpose by day; and of awe and comfort by night. Losing Kuat Drive Yards would not only send the planet's economy into a tailspin, but would also greatly hamper the Republic's ability to keep its member planets safe.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="772844" version="1065353216">From birth, Bey'wan Aygo's artistic parents nurtured him with culture, hoping he would one day follow in their footsteps. But when, as a young Bothan, he first spied a space battle through a telescope over his homeworld, the only art Aygo wanted to practice was that of interstellar combat.

In Aygo's eyes, he cannot be a great leader without the trust and support of the rank and file, so he has fostered an atmosphere of encouragement and community within the Republic First Fleet. He's more apt to commend someone for their achievements than to admonish those who happen to come up short, resulting in a fleet populated with pilots and crews who strive to excel. Throughout his lengthy career, Bey'wan Aygo has repeatedly displayed the layered intellect, quick judgment and unfaltering respect of his subordinates necessary to lead the Galactic Republic to greatness.</text>

As Wogawa sees it, mechanical systems are no different from living systems, requiring an equal amount of attention and nourishment. After stowing away on a pirate craft, Wogawa taught himself to provide such care to ships' engines and began a career as a hired hand on any ship that would have him on its crew.

Though Oro has learned to adopt a certain level of coarseness necessary to cope with crew dynamics, he is at heart a caring being. This is why, after witnessing the cruel, controlling nature of the Sith Empire all across the galaxy, Oro has opted to dedicate his affinity for the inner workings of starships to anyone who opposes them.</text>

In his formative years, however, the Rattataki did not get the joke and took his adopted parents' grooming very seriously, believing in their desire to have him one day become an Imperial officer. An early attempt to join the military academy on Dromund Kaas forced Ashy to finally see the painful truth. Humiliated, he defected to the Republic, where he has excelled as a weapons specialist.

Ashy takes great pleasure in exacting sweet revenge on the Empire one operation at a time, always making sure to send holorecordings to his disowned family that depict his every triumph as a proud soldier and citizen of the Galactic Republic.</text>

She successfully sliced her first computer system at age seven, and by the time she reached adulthood she had amassed a fortune in ill-gotten credits--assets that were lost to her when she was finally captured and jailed. Recognizing her potential, the Republic offered Kendra the chance to put her skills to use for the navy, which is where the young savant truly started to shine.

Exuberant, innovative and sentimental, Kendra popularized the naming of a particular evasive ship maneuver--the &quot;Koiogran Turn&quot;--after her home system of Koiogra. She sometimes feels the tug of her old life, but it's never enough for her to foolishly scrap this second chance.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="772848" version="1065353216">The defensive strategy rendered by B-3G9 in the First Battle of Bothawui is often cited as a primary reason for the Republic's victory in that grand conflict. Sent to its factory of origin for upgrades and maintenance as thanks for its service, Threegee was somehow caught in an administrative mix-up. By the time the Czerka factory discovered its mistake, the combat analysis droid had already undergone partial circuit remapping to conform to protocol-droid conventions. As a result, Threegee has become a war strategist with a polite and self-effacing manner.

While Threegee can no longer reach its former heights of tactical faculty, the droid is still quite deft with shield-to-power conversion calculations and starship defense management--though it does tend to fixate more over its faded glory than any recent accomplishments.</text>

Ranken's steely resolve and unwavering loyalty made her a vital component of Kilran's campaigns. During the historic Sacking of Coruscant, it was Ranken who coolly recommended the bombing of civilian population centers that would earn her mentor the nickname of &quot;the Butcher of Coruscant&quot;.

Now, as the celebrated admiral in command of the Imperial Forward Command, Ranken has adopted her mentor's affinity for bold initiatives, taking great pride in her capacity for cold and rational decision making. Ranken is always willing to listen to reason, even if it means allowing a contradictory voice to be heard, but she does not suffer circuitous talk or outright insubordination, opting to teach those who cannot or will not learn to be direct and respectful the error of their ways.</text>

In fact, he can be frequently caught carrying on about hyperdrive motivator cores and microfusion condenser arrays when no one's even around to listen. Writch's random babbling gives him the air of a scatterbrain, but his relentless chatter only helps clear his mind, allowing him to focus on whatever objective is laid before him.

Writch's eccentric and irreverent persona might cause those of a more serious bent to bristle, but there's no denying that he's a major talent worth putting up with. He hopes his hard work will one day bring him to the attention of his not-so-secret crush, noted Imperial technology guru Darth Acina.</text>

The closest Salana's ever felt to belonging was as hired muscle for a crime syndicate on Hutta. She eventually grew bored with breaking bones on that seedy planet, however, so she has since opted to turn her love of aggression into a career as a starship gunner.

While often dour and restless, Salana is known to display an enthralling intensity and gleeful passion for causing her enemies to suffer. She doesn't quite understand what she needs to finally feel at home, but she hopes she'll find it someday out among the stars.</text>

When the Darth disposed of his crew in a fit of frustration, he had to turn to the MZ unit to help manage the ship's many systems. Though not designed for such duties, Twelve was able to help guide the ship to an Imperial way station, where Darth Immern had the astromech's programming upgraded so that it could serve as his personal navigation droid.

Since Immern's death during the First Battle of Bothawui, Twelve has been in search of a new home. It is now quite adept with ship comms and sensors, and is known to have a bit of an ego about it.</text>

Upon reaching adulthood, Aven joined the Navy, where he excelled as a shield technician--that is until his parents, feeling slighted by his choice of military branch, pulled all the right strings to have him summarily discharged.

Maintaining an upbeat and unflappable air, Aven deflected his parents' cruel machinations, patriotically offering his services to any Imperial-aligned starship crew that would have him in spite of his abrupt disgrace. So long as he continues to fight the Empire's enemies, Aven feels he will yet prove himself to be a loyal and worthy combatant.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="774951" version="1065353216">The exploration of subterranean rakghoul tunnels by THORN personnel has led to many chilling revelations about rakghoul biology and behavior--none more horrifying than the gargantuan creature known as &quot;the Eyeless&quot;. Far larger than any rakghoul ever previously recorded, these creatures make their home near the very heart of the outbreak. Sensor probes and scouts have never found more than one such creature in each tunnel network.

No two THORN scientists can seem to agree on the role of the Eyeless in the rakghoul heirarchy. Some theorize that they are actually the source of the outbreaks, where others believe them to be a mere byproduct of the plague's progression. Until more detailed scans are made available, definitive answers on the nature of the Eyeless will likely remain out of reach.</text>

After the brief and fiery tenure of Darth Arho, and the failed schemes of Darth Vengean before that, it was imperative that an even-tempered, long-trusted Sith take up the affairs of the Imperial military. Enter Darth Arkous, veteran of the Great Galactic War and passionate loyalist.

With deep influence and fervent support from across the Empire's political landscape, Arkous is in a position to engage in grand offensive strategies without fear of interference--exactly the sort of bold maneuvering the Empire could use as it struggles to emerge from the brink of defeat.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="776016" version="1065353216">For the Sith Empire, no Republic target has been more tempting than Tython. Ever since reports of the Republic's rediscovery of the Jedi Order's birthplace, the Emperor had yearned to discover the planet's location. Once Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan relocated the Jedi Temple from Coruscant to Tython, finding Tython became not only a crusade but an imperative.

After a failed attempt by Darth Angral to destroy Tython, and with open war returning to the galaxy, the planet's defenses were strengthened considerably. Countless infiltration attempts by agents of the Empire have failed to provide significant insight into the inner workings of the Republic's security within the Tython system. But where Imperial Intelligence failed, Darth Arkous has apparently succeeded, and now Tython lays open to incursion.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="776017" version="1065353216">The Jedi Temple on Tython</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="776017" version="1065353216">The Sacking of Coruscant was arguably the greatest military win in the history of the Sith Empire. Not only did it force the Galactic Republic to desperately accept unfavorable terms in ending the Great War; it also allowed for the utter destruction of the Jedi Temple. While it was hoped that this act would crush the Jedi Order's resolve, the relatively recent rediscovery of the Order's homeworld of Tython presented an opportunity for the Jedi to relocate their Temple there.

Nestled among artifacts dating to the very origins of the Jedi Order, this new Jedi Temple represents an even greater symbolic objective for the Empire. From what little Imperial Intelligence had gathered on the new structure, the Jedi learned from the mistakes of Coruscant, installing powerful defenses and multilayered security measures. But for someone like Minister of Offense Darth Arkous, such hurdles only serve to make the Jedi Temple that much more appealing a target.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="776019" version="1065353216">Though Korriban has only been reclaimed as home of the Sith Order in recent decades, its rich ties to the Empire reach back thousands of years. For Republic forces to set foot on the planet, let alone capture the Sith Academy and Dark Council Chambers, is a great indignity to the Empire's leadership.

It has been reported that, upon hearing the news, Darth Marr ordered the full destruction of the nearest Republic-friendly space station. While this claim remains unsubstantiated, it does correctly illustrate the enduring rage felt by many across the galaxy. Even if the Sith Academy is wrested from Republic control, it may never again be regarded with the same pride it once was.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="777885" version="1065353216">In the war for the hearts and minds of the masses, propaganda can be a powerful weapon. Since the rakghoul plague surfaced on Alderaan, theories surrounding its point of origin have spread wider and faster than the plague itself.

House Organa immediately cited the outbreak's epicenter near King's Pass as proof that House Thul and the Empire were conspiring to use the plague as a biological weapon, while House Thul countered that House Organa implemented the outbreak themselves so they could place the blame on their rivals to stir up sympathy. Yet another premise suggests that House Ulgo nurtured the plague in order to ratchet up hostilities between Organa and Thul and further weaken the rival houses for Ulgo's eventual conquest.

While none of these accusations are likely to be revealed as true, one fact remains: Alderaan stands perilously close to the brink of a global rakghoul pandemic.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="777887" version="1065353216">Life is strenuous enough in a world torn asunder by the throes of war, but when an emergency development like the rakghoul plague emerges, the citizens of Corellia have no choice but to summon up new levels of endurance and courage.

To avoid the constant threat of bombings and looters, Selonians on the outskirts of Coronet City had repositioned their den-style homes far underground, surfacing only when it became absolutely necessary to acquire provisions. In the earliest days of the plague, rakghouls seeking an ideal foundation for their distinctive tunnel networks quickly invaded the dens. Hardened by their survivalist turn, however, the Sleonians found they were enough of a match to hold the rakghouls off--though not without many heart-rending casualties along the way.

Eventually, the rakghouls found their way underground via Coronet City's sewage system, but the Selonians who protected their dens from the growing epidemic can take some measure of satisfaction. Sometimes that's all a survivor needs to keep hanging on.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="777888" version="1065353216">Rakghouls on Tatooine</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="777888" version="1065353216">The first time rakghouls threw Tatooine into pandemonium, they came from the sky, spewing out from a wrecked ship called the Stardream. After the epidemic was believed to be contained, no one thought to check below the dunes of the desert planet for signs of the diseased beasts. 

When a seasoned clan of Jawa scavengers stripping the Stardream's interior for parts found a hull breach, they uncovered a network of rakghoul-infested tunnels deep underground. Cobbling spare parts into traps, the clan methodically captured and exterminated every remaining rakghoul and then used detonate charges to collapse the tunnels. 

Since that day, the clan have made the Stardream's husk into their home, seeing it as their solemn duty to keep watch over the hull breach, ever wary the rakghoul plague might return. Not having anticipated an entirely new infestation to rise up elsewhere in the Dune Sea, they are quite relieved for THORN's intervention and are more than content to let the organization's aid workers deal with the problem this time.</text>

With a commanding presence and blustery persona, Darok asks his Special Forces troops for nothing less than their unwavering obedience, which they gladly offer time and again.

High-risk offenses requiring on-the-fly conception and execution were commonplace in warzones like Corellia and Ilum, where Colonel Darok particularly thrived. His brand of decisive thinking under pressure has earned him the respect and admiration of many, including Special Forces General Elin Garza and Republic Supreme Commander Jace Malcom.</text>

In keeping with Jedi strictures against attachment, Theron's mother, Grand Master Satele Shan, sent her infant son to be raised by the Jedi who trained her, Master Ngani Zho.

Over time, as it became evident that Theron was not Force sensitive like his mother, he abandoned any notion of becoming a Jedi. Eventually, he joined the Strategic Information Service, using his adventurous nature and unique skillset to become a trusted field agent for the Republic.</text>

Some believe it would mark a major turning point in the war against the Empire. Others, however, share a grave concern that prolonged habitation on the planet would cause its occupiers to be drawn to the dark side of the Force.

A group of Jedi once encamped upon one of Korriban's seven moons with the aim of lessening the planet's intense dark side aura through meditation, but the call of the dark side overcame every last one of them in time. The group defected to the Empire, and have since been linked to the deaths of hundreds of Republic soldiers and civilians, as well as several Jedi.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="778239" version="1065353216">To disrupt the path of Sith apprentices hoping to one day become Dark Lords, even if it's for a moment, would be seen as a victory to many. But the true value of capturing the Sith Academy lies within the restricted halls and chambers of the Dark Council.

Though Sith are known to destroy sources of information in order to obfuscate the truth, the Emperor had accumulated a vast repository of arcane and taboo knowledge which is now believed to be curated by the Dark Council. This &quot;dark library&quot; could potentially be used to serve the Republic's interests instead of the Empire's--if administered with great caution.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="778240" version="1065353216">Not long ago, a vengeful Sith Lord attempted to obliterate Tython--and nearly succeeded. Ever since, protecting the Jedi Order's home from further incursion has been of paramount concern to the Republic. That an Imperial invasion force has slipped through Tython's new, heightened security architecture points to some unsettling possibilities.

The Empire's presence on Tython could be accounted for by flawed security design, which would make similar exploits throughout Republic space likely. And while reports from SIS show that Imperial Intelligence has been gutted, this breach could mean the Empire has rebuilt the agency--or that it still has loyal assets within the Republic. Whatever their advantage, the odds that it will persist are strong.</text>

But with its surface covered completely by water, and with its native Selkath population having adopted an isolationist stance, access to the planet can be difficult to come by. The Selkath economy's reliance on the export of kolto to the Republic and the Empire does provide opportunities to visit, but guests are typically limited to the world's few trading platforms--the only surface structures not affected by the Empire's bombardment of the planet during the Great Galactic War.

Millennia of Rakatan dominion over the planet and a predominantly unexplored ocean floor evoke strong temptations to probe Manaan's crushing depths. However, due to the strategic importance of its kolto reserves, Manaan will have to largely remain a mystery for now.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="778750" version="1065353216">Kolto is a medicinal fluid found naturally on the planet Manaan. Highly valued for its ability to heal, kolto can be found in use in hospitals, clinics and medical bays throughout the galaxy. It also has obvious applications for military use, helping soldiers to recover more quickly from wounds sustained in the throes of war.

The Selkath of Manaan strictly regulate the trade of their monopolistic supply of kolto. For this reason, many Republic and Imperial scientists have attempted to synthesize kolto. While a few less reliable, less stable caches of lab-procured kolto do exist, they are poor substitutes for the real thing.</text>

The architect of that bold attack--and of many other successful offensives on Corellia, Ilum and other worlds--was Colonel Rian Darok.

As the pride of Republic Special Forces, Colonel Darok remains high on the Empire's list of enemy targets. The fact that Darth Arkous now appears to be in league with Darok makes the Sith Lord's betrayal all the more severe.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="778752" version="1065353216">Even before the dismantling of Imperial Intelligence, no record existed of an SIS agent named Theron Shan. There are, however, vague accounts of a dangerous Republic asset dubbed &quot;Technoplague&quot; who may very well be Shan.

The asset first came to be known through his role in the death of Darth Mekhis of the Dark Council. He was later believed to have surfaced during the Battle of Duro and to have been instrumental in the destruction of the Ascendant Spear and the death of Darth Karrid, Mekhis's second successor to the Sphere of Technology. Karrid's successor, Darth Acina, gave the asset the Technoplague codename, but whether the perpetrator of both of these events is the same, and whether said perpetrator is Agent Shan, remains to be seen.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="778753" version="1065353216">Dark Partnership</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="778753" version="1065353216">From the Republic's vantage point, there's never any way to know for certain which Dark Lords of the Sith are seated on the Dark Council. The enigmatic and turbulent collective's roster is prone to constant change, making the task of keeping track all the more difficult. In fact, it was only very recently confirmed that a successor to the briefly tenured Darth Arho had been chosen.

Darth Arkous, from what little SIS has been able to gather, is more of a long-term strategist than his predecessor, opting for craftiness over belligerence. Because of this, others within the Empire have reportedly underestimated Arkous as a threat--and have ultimately suffered for it. With Special Forces heavyweight Colonel Darok on his side, Darth Arkous may now be the most dangerous Sith in the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="778754" version="1065353216">An Unexpected Ally</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="778754" version="1065353216">While no SIS database appears to mention Lana Beniko by name, further scrutiny might offer a glimpse into the psyche of this unusual Sith Lord. As detailed in an incident report, a skirmish on Hoth between Republic and Imperial forces during the Treaty of Coruscant ended abruptly when an unidentified female Sith Lord leapt into the midst of the battle, demanding an immediate ceasefire--and an explanation for the fight. When an Imperial officer suggested she wouldn't understand the nuances of military conflict, he lost his right hand to a lightning-fast lightsaber strike.

The Sith, whose reported appearance closely matches that of Beniko, then told everyone to return to their bases and not reengage. The command was promptly obeyed by all, and the Sith Lord was purportedly never seen by Republic forces again.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="783409" version="1065353216">Galactic Solutions Industries' latest innovation in on-the-field assistance is the GSI Satellite Support Suite. As stated in a corporate news release by GSI founder and CEO Addalar Hyland, &quot;Now anyone--from rescue workers to explorers to soldiers--can reap the benefits of enhanced protection and heightened effectiveness thanks to the SSS, which is powered by our proprietary Orbital Flux technology.&quot;

Like many innovations, Orbital Flux was discovered by accident. Recognizing the value in overcoming the travel and communications problems that plagued Makeb due to its notoriously harsh atmosphere, GSI researchers attempted to manipulate particle beams fired from orbit in such a way that they would counteract the effects. However, when driven through the atmosphere the particles took on exotic attributes that made them energy rich and malleable. While these new properties had no effect on starships or holotransmissions, they were found to be beneficial to living beings.

When signaled from the ground, the SSS bathes its target in Orbital Flux and the satellite enters Support Mode, continuously tracking the target's condition and location, and even providing medical probe assistance. While Orbital Flux only works on Makeb at present, GSI's technicians are striving to replicate the curious process without the help of Makeb's atmosphere.</text>

It was only after an &quot;incident&quot; in the Onderonian court that Jakarro was paired up with the protocol droid C2-D4. Although he claims to hate the droid (and has inflicted extensive damage to D4's chassis in moments of frustration) Jakarro never works without him, and the pair have carved out a reputation for their reliable work as smugglers and pirates-for-hire.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="793871" version="1065353216">Jedi turned Sith turned Jedi again: the life of Revan has been one of great contradiction. But when the Sith Emperor imprisoned Revan for more than three hundred years, Revan's ambitions became focused as never before, seeking to use his affinity with the Force to secretly influence his jailor. But Revan became unhinged in the end, and careened once more toward the dark side. Escaping imprisonment in a mad bid to destroy the Emperor for good, he was stopped by an Imperial strike force and believed dead.

If Revan has returned from the brink to lead the order that bears his name, it could be that his temperament has evened to suit the Revanites' key tenet of maintaining balance in the Force. Then again, considering that the Order of Revan was formed out of a deep devotion to his deeds, it's possible they would do anything Revan decreed regardless of his reasoning or intent. Since &quot;Revan&quot; has decided to make his presence known, it is undoubtedly only a matter of time before speculation gives way to certainty.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="793872" version="1065353216">Rakata Prime</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="793872" version="1065353216">Many thousands of years ago, in the sparsely populated Tempered Wastes of the Unknown Regions, the first galactic authority was born on Rakata Prime. Named for its once-predominant species whose Infinite Empire ruled for millennia over hundreds of worlds, the planet is now a dangerous tropical wasteland, ravaged by weapons of mass destruction and overrun with deadly beasts and savage Rakata.

While few traces of the advanced Rakatan civilization exist on the planet today, it is undoubtedly a treasure trove of lost knowledge and technologies--and not just their own. A nullifying field once employed by the Rakata commonly disrupted the navigational systems of orbiting vessels, causing them to crash into the planet. As a result, Rakata Prime has become something of a starship graveyard.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="793873" version="1065353216">Rakata Tribes</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="793873" version="1065353216">In the face of near-extinction and the mysterious loss of Force sensitivity among most of their kind, the Rakata retreated to their homeworld, where they focused their cruel aggressions on one another, descending further into ruin. When the dust of global war settled, all that remained of the galactic tyrants was a collection of barbaric and ruthless Rakata tribes that has dominated the planet for more than twenty thousand years.

Some tribes reside in isolation, hidden deep within the jungle islands of Rakata Prime. Others are more aggressive, seeking to conquer and assimilate as many other tribes as possible, uniting the world under their rulership--an echo of their technologically advanced ancestors' attempt at galactic supremacy. Eventually, the dominating tribe's control becomes stretched too thin and the sub-tribes revolt, breaking free until the cycle inevitably repeats.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="793874" version="1065353216">Infinite Army</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="793874" version="1065353216">Since its destruction, many have sought to own pieces of the fabled Star Forge--an automated Rakata shipyard capable of infinite manufacturing. A Selkath experimenting with cybernetic applications using Rakatan technology was one of those looking to harness the Star Forge's immeasurable power. With the shipyard's self-replicating properties, the Selkath theorized implementation of its parts could allow his test subjects to survive the grafting process, and to achieve virtual immortality. When the Order of Revan made a piece of the Star Forge available to him, the Selkath was able to prove his theories and the Infinite Army was born.

This is not the first time the notion of an Infinite Army was conceived. A tormented Jedi looking to destroy the Sith Emperor once appropriated a long-abandoned Rakata foundry built into an asteroid. However, his reputed plan to use the foundry to build an &quot;infinite army&quot; of extermination droids was ultimately prevented.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="793875" version="1065353216">Temple of the Ancients</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="793875" version="1065353216">No one knows for certain how long the Temple of the Ancients has stood, which is hardly a surprise. Much of the history of Rakata Prime--and that of its one-time conquerors who placed the galaxy into servitude--has remained undiscovered. What is known of the temple is its relatively recent history.

A tribe of Rakata known as the Elders had charged themselves with guarding the temple from other tribes, even though their species no longer had the affinity with the Force required to enter their ancestors' hallowed repository. The Elders held that the temple's secrets must be too important to fall into less civilized hands than theirs. It was this tribe that allowed the Jedi Revan to enter the temple and learn how to destroy the corrupted Rakata superweapon known as the Star Forge. It's unclear what has happened to the tribe in the three hundred years since then as the Temple of the Ancients is no longer under their protection.</text>

Rival clans compete to prove their superior wealth, attempting to sponsor the most parties, pit fights, bounties, gambling, and every other public display of fortune and excess imaginable.

Popularized among outside cultures during visits to Nar Shaddaa, this exuberant holiday is now celebrated on hundreds of worlds across the galaxy, where it's simply known by its Huttese name; any connection to ancient wartime looting is largely ignored.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="794206" version="1065353216">For millennia, the Selkath had no contact with other worlds. Then the Rakata came to Manaan and enslaved the Selkath, forcing them to construct monuments to the great Infinite Empire. After the Infinite Empire's fall, the Selkath were left in isolation once more. Now aware of the greater galaxy and its many species, the Selkath decided to build a city on the surface--a shining capital designed for tourism, trade and diplomacy.

Ahto City was a thriving metropolis. At one point, large contingents of the Republic and the Empire lived side by side in Ahto City despite the raging Jedi Civil War. This awkward arrangement was made possible due to both sides' desperate need for Manaan's healing agent, kolto. More recently, however, the Sith Empire grew tired of Selkath neutrality and bombarded the planet from orbit, destroying most of Manaan's surface structures--including Ahto City. The Selkath have since retreated to the depths, abandoning their once-great capital, now a half-sunken wreck.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="794362" version="1065353216">Mercantile Plaza of Manaan</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="794362" version="1065353216">After the bombardment of Manaan's surface cities and structures by the Empire, the Selkath became deeply untrusting of offworlders and once again withdrew to the depths, from which it was believed they would never return. But with the demand for Manaan's healing fluid kolto at an all-time high, it would only be a matter of time before outside influences would attempt to reestablish contact.

A diplomat from the ocean world Dac, Advocate Mahreen, spent several years convincing a delegation from the Selkath's protective Order of Shasa to even meet with her. Over time, and with Republic pressure mounting, Mahreen was able to coax the order into converting one of the few existing surface platforms into the Mercantile Plaza. There, the Selkath could provide kolto in exchange for much-desired goods from across the galaxy. The denizens of Manaan found the plaza to be successful enough that, despite protests from the Republic, a trade relationship was soon reestablished with the Empire, thus clinching the planet's status once more as a strategic imperative.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="794495" version="1065353216">One of the very few protocol droids in the galaxy to bear a criminal record, C2-D4 is unusual to say the least. Constructed as part of a bulk order for the royal court of Onderon, it's unclear whether his capacity for deception and murder were an inherent design flaw or a sneaky alteration made by a political rival.

Even before his partner Jakarro removed his limbs, D4 rarely got his own hands dirty, preferring to use his language skills to manipulate events toward profitable outcomes rather than risking his own safety. Though his deceptions were never proven on Onderon, his assignment to assist a short-tempered Wookiee and the court's later willingness to let the droid leave with his new master suggest that there were at least some persons in authority who may have suspected D4's true capabilities.</text>

But when a pirate craft crash-landed on Rishi more than a hundred years ago, all that changed.

With its plentiful fossil fuel reserves and close proximity to a largely unexplored dwarf galaxy, this tropical pearl of a planet has since become a favorite hub for underworld types in search of riches, refuge from authorities or just a good time.</text>

&quot;This does not mean that we should seek to eradicate these old wounds. The scars left behind are a part of who we are today. We must learn the contours of these scars so that we may fully understand ourselves, and so that we may better serve as Jedi.

From the exterior, they appear to be standard-issue Imperial probe droids, but further investigation would reveal an amalgamation of technology both exotic and arcane. Much like the Emperor's Hand, these droids are connected through the Force in some way to the mind and will of the Emperor himself.

No details, no forwarding address: simply &quot;Retired&quot;. The vagaries of such an entry can set an imagination ablaze with theories as to what it might actually mean. Many of those theories could very well be correct.

There is ample evidence that those who had reached retirement age were sent to Medical Services for a final health examination that implemented an &quot;electrochemical mental therapy session&quot; to leave the retiree &quot;free from the traumas brought on by a protracted period of service.&quot; Some whose information or abilities were deemed too valuable for such &quot;therapy&quot; were forcibly retired to highly secure locations like Nar Shaddaa's Shadow Town. Others still, such as the agency's former Minister, wielded enough sensitive information to hold the Empire in check and--to some extent--decide their own fates. Most, however, were likely &quot;retired&quot; by Intelligence in the most time-efficient, cost-effective and predictable manner possible.</text>

So it was when Thera Markon, daughter to notable bounty hunter Crysta Markon, decided to take up smuggling.

Thera's life of small-time scores may not be the most ambitious, but it's a level of danger and income she was accustomed to--until her mother lost her life because of her thieving. If nothing else, Crysta's intervention and sacrifice may signal to Thera that her mother wasn't entirely disapproving of her life choices in the end.

He can sense through the Force when and where he'll be needed and plans his travel accordingly--even if those plans take him straight into the heart of danger.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803892" version="1065353216">For ages, Dark Lords of the Sith have yearned to reproduce the arcane abilities of Tulak Hord; the process behind his nearly successful bid for true immortality in particular has either eluded or ultimately disappointed those who have sought to know it.

Whispered rumors persist of many varying ways to achieve eternal life, from the obviously false to the convincingly esoteric. Lord Veijel's recent discovery on Rishi appears to be the most promising candidate to date, but as with past claims that were proved too good to be true, this newfound lifespan extender may not be as it appears on the surface.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803893" version="1065353216">Carida Corsairs. Corellian Run Scoundrels. Nova Blades. Rishi certainly has its fill of interstellar gangs staking their claim on the tropical world. But none are as feared as the home-grown band of ruthless pirates known as the Ravagers.

The Ravagers began as a tight-knit group of intrepid youth who explored the planet's many untouched isles in search of adventure and long-lost treasures. When they found a rusty old hoverbarge tucked away inside a vast cove, they set their minds to restoring the ship to working order so they could take it out for joyrides. But by the time the barge was restored, the children were adults--adults who had placed every last credit into their dream. The dire need to recoup their investment led the group down a murky path that began with simple heists and eventually led to bloody sieges on transport freighters.

While these one-time innocents are now long dead, the dark legend they spawned lives on.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803894" version="1065353216">Every Ravager dreams of being captain. The man called Ruugar was no exception. Born into the Ravagers, Ruugar's early life was relentlessly unforgiving, and he thrived on that adversity. As an adult, Ruugar used his gruff, one-of-us charisma to gain the loyalty of his fellow pirates, leading them in a near-bloodless mutiny against the reigning captain, the vicious tyrant O'kar A'ko. Ruugar had achieved his life's goal.

But all the renewed vigor and revelry spurred by a new and popular leader can only last so long, and eventually even the staunchest supporters start to find their eye drifting to the throne. While Ruugar can lay claim to the longest tenure as captain, it was a tenure that ended when his friend Coratanni sliced off Ruugar's hand and tossed him overboard for the skar'klas to feed on.

Through stark perseverance, Ruugar survived the ordeal. Now, one hand short but twice as determined, he's ready to take another run at captaincy.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803895" version="1065353216">It's been several years since the particularly coarse Wookiee known only as Torque joined the Ravagers in the seas and over the skies of Rishi. Before then, Torque's natural knack for massaging every last bit of propulsion out of an engine landed him a position as Chief Engineer of a Republic cruiser. But his self-reliant nature and volatile temper led to Torque &quot;reprimanding&quot; his colleagues with the massive spanner he favors.

After serving time for battery, Torque left Republic space in search of a crew more befitting his temperament, leading him to Rishi and the Ravagers. The pirates allow Torque to run the engine room just the way he likes: alone. He does have a team of repair droids at the ready when major damage arises, but even they seem to raise his ire. The only droid--or being, for that matter--the Wookiee is known to get along with is BO-55, which Torque programmed himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803896" version="1065353216">BO-55 and Blaster</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803896" version="1065353216">Why employ a single droid in combat when you can have two droids with different strengths and weaknesses working in concert? That was how the astromech who calls himself BO-55 convinced the Ravagers to allow him to supervise the construction of Blaster, Rishi's oversized weapon of devastation who enters into battle with a child-like enthusiasm and several pounds of high-grade detonite.

BO-55 himself was once a discontinued model destined for the scrap heap until the Ravagers' engineering guru Torque reprogrammed and refitted him. Now he's the sort of droid a bloodthirsty pirate would gladly call friend. Together with Blaster, BO-55 plots out elaborate &quot;operations&quot; designed to inflict maximum embarrassment and carnage. Never content to let Blaster have all the fun, BO-55 can manage just fine in a firefight himself and will gladly join his creation side-by-side in the thick of it.</text>

If you're anything like Coratanni, you spit on that life and find a better one. Born to Nova Blades on Rishi, Coratanni--&quot;Cora&quot; to her friends--was never taken seriously by the pirates she called family. Her sly notions were seen more as an indication of a good trader than a good pirate, and her thirst for adventure was seen as just no good.

Far too ambitious to be a simple merchant, Cora eventually stowed away on a ship departing Raider's Cove. When that ship was raided and boarded by pirates, young Cora defended herself admirably--so much so that the captain offered her a place with his crew, the legendary Ravagers. Ever since, Cora's pushed and robbed and fought and connived to make a name for herself--like a good Ravager should. She has finally found her ambitions rewarded in this, her better life.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803898" version="1065353216">The Rishii have soared as their planet's dominant species for many thousands of years. Their powerful wings, honed talons and knack for mimicking the sounds of other living things make them natural hunters. While highly intelligent, they prefer to apply their smarts to reflective and societal matters over technological advancement.

Content to lead simple lives in villages set atop high mountain peaks and grow their population at a glacial pace, the Rishii have no reason to war amongst themselves, though their ability to defend themselves from predators make them skillful combatants. Some Rishii have chosen to relocate closer to the outsiders who have colonized the world in recent years, the most adventurous among them integrating more fully and opting for the thrill of a pirate's life.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803899" version="1065353216">Raider's Cove</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803899" version="1065353216">In the hearts and minds of many of its residents, Raider's Cove isn't some cobbled-together beach town--it's their safe haven. The same relative lawlessness that allows unsavory types to steal and fight with abandon also gives those who don't wish to live under the rule of galactic authorities a suitable home. And it's not as though Raider's Cove is a hotbed of anarchy: the town's founding pirate crew, the Nova Blades, routinely contend with residents and visitors who become too much of a nuisance.

The first phase of Raider's Cove, now a bustling port, was built using only what the stranded Nova Blades had available from their crashed ship, plus whatever natural resources they could plunder from the local Rishii. As more pirates arrived on Rishi and the local economy began to flourish, relatively polished structures were constructed along the black-sand shores and Raider's Cove became a vacation destination for adventure and trouble seekers everywhere--a true resort for the wicked.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803900" version="1065353216">Blaster's Path</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803900" version="1065353216">Raider's Cove has become a top stop for those who like their fun times in a tropical paradise seasoned with a healthy pinch of danger, and the Blaster's Path cantina is the go-to destination. Set a short distance from ebony-sanded beaches, patrons can enjoy their drinks out under the warmth of the sun and in Rishi's tranquil waters. And when the weather turns, the Path serves as shelter from relentless monsoons and chilly winter nights.

The Path's two stories offer ample space for drinks, concerts, card tournaments, and large private events, leaving many first-timers stunned to hear the cantina's owner downplay its qualities. But anyone who knows Kareena knows that her dry cynicism comes from regret. Ever since she allowed the Nova Blades a stake in the Path, the Blades have had their run of the place and profits have declined as a result. Kareena does hold onto a glimmer of hope that she'll one day make the Blaster's Path fully hers again, though she's not exactly holding her breath.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803901" version="1065353216">Few trade routes have become as precious to interstellar commerce as the hyperlane known as the Corellian Run. It should come as no surprise, then, that the Corellian Run is also highly attractive to criminals. But of all those who rob, ransack and hijack, only one crew dares to take its name after the route itself.

As one might expect from a gang of smugglers named the &quot;Corellian Run Scoundrels&quot;, they typically scoff at honor and kindness while swaggering with naked arrogance. The legend persists that one of the Scoundrels' most notorious captains, Kai Zykken, once kidnapped the adult daughter of Denon corporate magnate Viril Shu--not for ransom, but to woo her so she'd marry him into Shu's fortune. Zykken was reportedly--and not at all surprisingly--unsuccessful in his plan.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803903" version="1065353216">At one time, the Corida Corsairs were the bane of the coreward end of the Perlemian Trade Route. Their brazen and ruthless tactics struck fear into dozens of Republic-aligned worlds for more than two hundred years. The Corsairs' hijackings, raids and ransom demands became the stuff of legend. The very utterance of their name would send ripples of dread throughout the political halls of Coruscant.

All that changed when the Corsairs' home base on Carida was discovered and raided by a Republic strike force. Without a center of operations, the remaining Corsairs were either picked off or scattered to the winds. Over time, the Carida Corsairs became something of a laughing stock, often depicted in popular fiction as ineffectual bunglers. But the remaining Carida Corsairs, often identified by their Kowakian Monkey-Lizard accomplices, have moved on to more remote parts of the galaxy, like Rishi. They have kept their name out of pride, hoping that one day they will be powerful enough to call Carida their home and strike fear into the Republic once again.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803904" version="1065353216">More than a century ago, a roving crew of adventurous pirates called the Nova Blades embarked on a perilous journey that would take them outside of the galaxy itself. In attempting to navigate the byzantine path to the dwarf galaxy known as the Rishi Maze, the Nova Blades ultimately lost their way. With hardly any fuel left, they somehow managed to find their way back and crash-landed on the only planet within reach--Rishi.

Their ship, the Aggressor, took on heavy damage when it slammed into a mountain on a pristine jungle isle. With no way off the planet, the Nova Blades took to making a home for themselves on Rishi. By the time the Nova Blades learned to refine Rishi's abundant fossil fuels and return to the stars, it was not to escape but to send out invitations to like-minded gangs and individuals. Their offer: come with us to a lush oasis far away from galactic governance. Unsurprisingly, not a single invitee turned them down.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803905" version="1065353216">Nova Blades</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803905" version="1065353216">Originally a loose conglomerate of independent pirate crews dedicated to resource sharing, the Nova Blades became a proper gang when the value of tactical collaboration started to outweigh the freedom of operational independence. Ever since, the galaxy's major hyperroutes have suffered from the Blades' legendary hijackings, raids and blockades. A line item known as &quot;Blade Tax&quot; is commonly used by corporate accountants as an expected cost of doing business.

The Nova Blades' fleets are nomadic, allowing them to take swift and nimble action virtually anywhere they choose, while also making them difficult to attack directly. More recently, some Nova Blades have established planetary bases of operations. Thus far, these permanent posts do not appear to have been targeted by corporations, governments or rival gangs.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803906" version="1065353216">Following a set of chronal intervals unrelated to any known calendar, Angol, Bez, and Derrus Martilla venture out from their home in the Spawn Nebula to revel in the spirit of the hunt. Calling themselves the &quot;Slayers Three&quot;, these proud siblings make landfall on a world decreed by their shamans to track and kill that world's most formidable beasts in ceremonial fashion. The Slayers Three are said to be among the galaxy's most skilled big-game hunters, having yet to find a creature that could get the best of them.

Some have come to question the veracity of the Slayers' story, even calling the siblings delusional. Since no one can determine which world they're from--even with their peculiar accents--there is no sure way to verify who these &quot;shamans&quot; are or what specific purpose the Slayers' &quot;ceremonial hunt&quot; serves. But the reported growing cynicism of one of the siblings does lend some credence to their stories. Regardless of any debate about the truth, one fact endures: when the Slayers Three arrive to hunt, excitement is sure to follow.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803908" version="1065353216">The Aggressor</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803908" version="1065353216">To visitors and most of the residents of Raider's Cove, it is a shipwreck. At most, a unique landmark that stands tall along the western horizon. But to the Nova Blades on Rishi, the Aggressor is their home. Since its construction, the corvette has traversed the galaxy and beyond as part of the Nova Blades' pursuit of riches and notoriety, but now its engines and hull stand in such a state of disassembly and devastation that it will never sail among the stars again.

Even as an apparent husk, the Aggressor continues to serve its owners' needs. The portion of the vessel that rests parallel to the ground is now used for security services, management and, when inclement weather strikes, social gatherings; the vertical aft has been cleverly refitted to serve as living quarters and minor manufactories, with scrap metal and wood used to fashion ladders and lifts along the ship's former halls.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803909" version="1065353216">Commodore Margok</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803909" version="1065353216">By and large, the galaxy's most notorious pirates become well known because they operate on the galactic stage. But most pirates do not seek this level of infamy, perfectly content to remain on their birthworld, never daring to venture out among the stars. Such is the case with Commodore Dael Margok of the notorious Nova Blades.

Margok's direct ancestor, Ralen Margok, was a key player in the effort to turn the Aggressor into a base of operations after the ship crash-landed on Rishi more than a century ago. Because of this, Margok maintains the Nova Blades' presence on the world with a profound sense of personal pride. He truly sees his fellow Blades as his equals and as family, and will stop at nothing to see that they are provided for and that their legacy lives on.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803910" version="1065353216">Rishi Maze</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803910" version="1065353216">At the edge of the galaxy, on the fringes of the Outer Rim, a unique phenomenon has fascinated scientists and ignited the imaginations of treasure hunters and explorers for millennia: a dwarf-class companion galaxy called the &quot;Rishi Maze&quot;. 

Navigation to the Rishi Maze--even while using its spatial constant, Rishi, as a starting point--can be quite difficult, hence the galaxy's name. Some have ventured out never to return, while others have partly managed the multi-point hyperspace path only to turn back for fear of being lost to the cosmos. A few have actually made the trip and returned. These travelers speak in underwhelming terms about lifeless planets with mundane elemental compositions, but whether they're being truthful or attempting to hoard the potential riches of the Rishi Maze for themselves, none can truly say.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803911" version="1065353216">Rishii Village</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803911" version="1065353216">Species-wide, the Rishii appreciate community. Many, however, also exhibit an affinity for transience. Because of this, Rishii villages are designed to offer lodging and social activities in a tribal setting for as long as any family or individual Rishii wishes to remain. No one owns property but rather claims it for a time of their choosing.

Rishii villages are commonly set upon high elevation near the sea, allowing the Rishii to easily spot prey in the waters below while severely restricting the pathways of would-be predators. Their huts are typically built from bark, roots, branches and cereal stalks. They are far more durable than appears at first glance, as each hut is constructed with its specific location in mind to best withstand local atmospheric patterns and phenomena. A more recent addition to their villages are wooden bridges, which have been added for the convenience of non-Rishii guests.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803912" version="1065353216">Way of the Rishii</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803912" version="1065353216">Not much is known about the history of the avian Rishii, and that's largely due to their peculiarly hands-off nature as a species. While they do pass on knowledge from generation to generation, the Rishii tend to have little interest in formally chronicling the course of events. They appear far more interested observing and assessing the nature of animals and other peoples.

From day to day, many Rishii spend their time between fishing, crafting and family duties. More recently, they've taken to employing their uncanny talent for mimicry in grand productions devoted to the recreation of tall tales of the pirates who they now share their world with. Perhaps surprisingly, just as the Rishii have left the pirates to their own devices, so have the pirates opted not to disturb the Rishii. Even the planet's most notorious pirate crew, the Ravagers, are content to leave the amiable Rishii to live their modest lives.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803914" version="1065353216">While the Nova Blades on Rishi make a sound income from extortion and slave trafficking, their strongest growth category has been in mining the fossil fuel exonium. In its solid state, exonium coals are easy to ignite and burn for a long time at a high, stable temperature. In fact, the Rishii have long used exonium to keep warm and render fish fat. Its real value, however, comes from refinement.

In attempting to return to the stars after being stranded on Rishi for an extended period, the Nova Blades found that refined exonium not only made a suitable fuel for propulsion systems but also acted as an effective reactant fuel for their hypermatter drives. Because of its value, the Nova Blades tried to keep the origin world of exonium a secret, but now anxious prospectors have begun to trickle in from all over the galaxy. Whether these prospectors will pay the Nova Blades' recently introduced Exonium Export Tax remains to be seen.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803915" version="1065353216">Order and efficiency keep the Imperial machine running smoothly; any element acting in opposition is quickly and ruthlessly excised. Great minds have often cracked under the pressure of potentially being found out for merely harboring seditious thoughts, much less acting on them. And yet evidence continues to mount that scores of personnel--perhaps thousands--have risked everything to secretly side with the Revanites. If the Order of Revan's doctrine can sway even well-regarded Sith such as Lord Ivress and Darth Arkous, there's no telling just how thoroughly the Empire has been corrupted by it.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803916" version="1065353216">When it comes to compatibility, few pets in the criminal underworld can outmatch a monkey-lizard from the planet Kowak. Their intelligence allows them to understand and execute complex commands, while their small size, nimble bodies and prehensile tails make it easy for them to maneuver through small spaces. The Kowakian monkey-lizard isn't exactly defenseless, either. When cornered, they are known to go for any would-be assailant's neck and eyes with their sharp claws and powerful beaks.

For those whose sense of humor tends toward the sadistic, it also doesn't hurt that Kowakian monkey-lizards are notoriously cruel. Their knack for recognizing weakness in others provides ample opportunity for acts of public humiliation, which they'll often carry out while chirping away with a mocking laughter that will haunt the victim until their dying days.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803917" version="1065353216">The Rishii do not have leaders as such, but there are those of great intellect and vast experience who are often looked to for wisdom and guidance. One such Rishii is Arankau, whose placid manner and even keel belie a most violent event from his past.

In his youth, like all Rishii, Arankau was curious about the Nova Blades. He was also wary that they might one day attack. He constantly monitored the Blades' behavior and made note of their combat capabilities whenever they fought amongst themselves. When a group of Blades finally decided it was time to test the resolve of the native Rishii by raiding their villages, Arankau was ready with an ambush. Dozens of Rishii led by Arankau severely wounded every Nova Blade in sight--but left not one of them dead. It was the last time outsiders ever sought to cross the Rishii. It also marked the only time Arankau has ever had to fight.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803918" version="1065353216">Of all the worlds one would expect to find the Order of Revan's plan unfolding, Rishi would hardly seem a likely candidate. While it's true that the island-dotted paradise would be ideal for planning without fear of interference, the lack of Imperial and Republic presence would also limit the ability to act on those plans. That is, unless the Empire and Republic were somehow drawn to Rishi.

The Nova Blades were employed by the Revanites to trick the galactic powers into believing their most vital fleets were at the mercy of the pirate gang's infamous hyperlane raids; in reality they were being corralled into a trap. With a signal jammer taking away their ability to communicate with one another and with their ships compromised by Revanite traitors, Darth Marr and Master Shan--and the many thousands under their command--now stand on the brink of annihilation, just as Revan had intended.</text>

These semiaquatic, carnivorous reptiles thrive in wet, tropical climes, and are strong, fast, and deadly. Their scaly hides and plated manes offer protection from other predators while their sharp teeth and powerful jaws allow them to quickly devour their prey. A legend persists that skar'klas find relief in having the undersides of their mane plates scratched, but so far no one has been known to dare attempt to confirm it.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803920" version="1065353216">Domestication of the foraging omnivores known as grophets has long been a goal of livestock farmers on Rishi, but the notoriously stubborn and intelligent mammals do not take well to pens or cages. Grophets use their dense mass, low centers of gravity and nodule-pocked foreheads to ram defensively into predators and other nuisances, while their long, sensitive ears make them especially difficult to get the drop on. Grophet demand has spiked among game hunters in recent years as their raw entrails have become a noted Hutt delicacy.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803921" version="1065353216">The Rishii have always had to concern themselves with predators, but in all of their recorded history they have never encountered a terror as great as She Who Greedily Devours. The few Rishii who have survived her savage attacks do not know what else to call her, as they've never before seen a kell dragon--and very few anywhere in the galaxy have ever come across a kell dragon of this magnitude.

&quot;Kellie&quot;, as she was once affectionately known, arrived on Rishi as the hatchling mascot of a new Outer Rim chapter of the Corellian Run Scoundrels. Soon these smugglers found that as Kellie quickly grew so did her appetite, making her cost-prohibitive as a pet. Fearing the prospect of bankruptcy, the Scoundrels' leader callously dumped Kellie into a garbage scow where the kell dragon gorged herself on irradiated refuse for days, likely accounting for both her intimidating stature and surly disposition.</text>

&quot;Information on Yavin 4 has not been easy to come by, but I have scoured the libraries of Tython and what I have discovered is fascinating. 

&quot;The first corruption of Yavin's fourth moon by the dark side that we know of corresponds with the arrival of Dark Lord Naga Sadow some fourteen hundred years ago. I'm not entirely sure whether Sadow was drawn here by the dark side or if he himself planted the first seed of its presence. That's one of the many things I hope to learn while I'm here.

&quot;Sadow was a gifted alchemist who turned his Massassi followers into powerful, violent animals who worshipped and served Sadow. The Massassi built massive temples for Sadow where they sacrificed their own in his honor. Sadow was even powerful enough to stave off the inevitable. He placed himself in a near-death slumber, which he remained in for hundreds of years, waiting until someone would come to take his place....&quot;</text>

&quot;There was a time when Freedon Nadd was only known as an impetuous Padawan who murdered his well-regarded master and then fled to parts unknown. But we now know that Nadd fled here, to Yavin 4, thirsty for insight into the dark side. Even now I can feel the corrupting power he must have felt in the halls of these temples. Nadd's arrival reawakened Naga Sadow, who took Nadd as his apprentice. When Nadd emerged from his training, he destroyed Sadow and took his place as Dark Lord of the Sith.

&quot;As far as we're aware, Freedon Nadd never physically returned to the halls of Naga Sadow's temples, but he wasn't entirely finished with the place either. Centuries after his own demise, he would influence another Jedi in training to repeat Yavin 4's dark cycle....&quot;</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803924" version="1065353216">From the journal of Jedi Master Arlo Grennen during his investigation into the dark side's influence on Yavin 4:

&quot;Just as Naga Sadow trained his eventual replacement, so did Freedon Nadd's spirit find a powerful apprentice in Exar Kun. And just as Nadd killed his lord Sadow, Kun destroyed Nadd's spirit here on Yavin 4. These notable deaths likely served to further imbue the moon's temples with dark power, further fueling the barbaric Massassi--as well as the succession of Dark Lords who would later reside here.

&quot;I think Kun saw what Naga Sadow had accomplished here with Sith alchemy and architecture and decided he could do better. He forced the Massassi to build new temples, but this time with a focus on complementing and augmenting the dark side. Kun even went so far as to use various technologies to manipulate the Force in ways that I can't say I understand. I can't, but I would like to....&quot;</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803925" version="1065353216">From the journal of Jedi Master Arlo Grennen during his investigation into the dark side's influence on Yavin 4:

&quot;A few hundred years ago, the Jedi Order thought they could cleanse Yavin 4 of its dark influence. They were more aggressive then. I'm actually impressed. The Jedi bombarded the world from orbit with a destructive manifestation of light side power in the hopes it would free the moon from its dark embrace.

&quot;The attacking Jedi destroyed much of the life on Yavin 4, which they later worked to restore to its previous state. They thought they'd won, that they'd removed the influence of the dark side. How wrong they were. The Massassi are still here. The dark side is still present. I would not be surprised if Exar Kun's spirit remains, waiting for someone--a Jedi like myself, perhaps--to find him....&quot;</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803926" version="1065353216">Jedi Master Arlo Grennen's final journal entry during his investigation into the dark side's influence on Yavin 4:

&quot;I thought I would find Exar Kun. I believed like a fool that I might be next in line. I felt its pull, the dark side. I yearned for it. Yearned to be taught everything, to become more than what I am.

&quot;What I found instead, what found me, is exquisite. Terrifying. Perfect. Perfect.

&quot;Revan is coming. I vowed to do everything in my power to stop Revan, but he does not want me to. He chose this place, he knew this day would come, knew the very core of me, everything.

&quot;Vitiate, I will make you stronger, I will grant you the only sustenance I know to give, I will become a part of your glory. It's going to be so beautiful I only wish I could live to see&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803929" version="1065353216">Yavin 4</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803929" version="1065353216">More than two dozen moons orbit the Outer Rim gas giant Yavin. Of those moons, the one designated Yavin 4 is by far the most habitable, supporting a vast array of flora and fauna within its lush and endless jungles.

Yavin 4 also holds a great deal of interest to the Jedi and the Sith. For well over a thousand years now, the dark side of the Force has flowed through Yavin 4 in an ever-increasing magnitude. But those who visit the moon's deadly rainforests and swamps in search of an explanation for the phenomenon rarely return, and never with any answers.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803930" version="1065353216">Massassi</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803930" version="1065353216">It doesn't require much of an imagination to see that the hulking Massassi are genetic cousins to the Sith Pureblood. Both share the same distinctive skin tones, skeletal ridges and body tendrils. Both are also Force-sensitive, though the similarities typically end there. Nourished by the dark side of the Force, the yellow-eyed Massassi have developed a culture based around hunting, combat and violent ritual sacrifice.

On Yavin 4 in particular, the Massassi are markedly different from Purebloods. These impossibly strong warriors have developed dense and sharp claws on their hands and feet, and their intellect has diminished to the point that they rely almost entirely on animal instinct and use grunts to communicate. Their society, such as it is, has devolved into true barbarism.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803931" version="1065353216">The Coalition</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803931" version="1065353216">One of the most profound developments of recent times will not be shared. It will not be celebrated, and only in the softest of voices in the most secure locations will it be discussed. Acting largely on their own, the Dark Council's Darth Marr and Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan have agreed to a temporary truce amongst their forces, going so far as to plan and act in concert against their common foe, the Revanites.

If these coalition forces are successful--if they can put aside their differences long and well enough to stop Revan's mad scheme--it could be seen as a bridge to a more permanent agreement. While some might welcome such a scenario, others are all too content to see their differences worked through on the battlefield. They would never compromise their ideologies, even if doing so could spare the lives of millions.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803932" version="1065353216">Imperial Guard Academy</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803932" version="1065353216">Before the Emperor's apparent demise, the Empire's greatest non-Force-sensitive combatants were selected for the Imperial Guard to serve and defend the Emperor himself. But being selected and developing into a guardsman were two different matters entirely.

The Emperor chose worlds strong in the dark side for his academies--locations where his influence was strongest, where he could form a bond with his would-be guardsmen. In these academies, the candidates would undergo a relentless, merciless training regimen that included regularly scheduled battles to the death. Regardless of what kind of person entered an Imperial Guard academy, if they survived they would emerge as a honed-to-perfection killing machine molded to the Emperor's will.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803933" version="1065353216">Lord Darkspanner</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803933" version="1065353216">Before becoming the backbone of Revan's campaign to destroy the Emperor at any cost, the Order of Revan was a small, subversive cult started by Sith Lord Tari Darkspanner. She believed in her heart that Revan had never truly died hundreds of years ago. She was correct, but her devotion to the enigmatic figure revolved around her theory that Revan had quietly overthrown the Emperor and, having been found out by the Dark Council, was locked away.

Darkspanner learned the truth of Revan's fate when the man himself appeared to her in a vision beckoning her to leave Dromund Kaas and seek him out. Impressed with all she'd accomplished as the self-appointed &quot;Master&quot; of the order, Revan offered Darkspanner the opportunity to expand the order's roster and purpose. Now Lord Darkspanner serves as one of Revan's most trusted commanders, devoted as ever to the doctrine of Revan.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803934" version="1065353216">Two Revans</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803934" version="1065353216">There has always been a dual nature to the legend of Revan. At his core, is he truly a Jedi or is he Sith? It has been a hotly debated subject among scholars and politicians for centuries. As one might expect, the conclusions reached by those from Republic-aligned worlds often differ from those of an Imperial bent--but not always.

Some of the most knowledgeable authorities in the ways of the Force believe that it is right to call Revan a Jedi Knight and it is also right to refer to him as Dark Lord of the Sith. They contend that simultaneously knowing and embracing both the light and dark sides of the Force is possible, and point to Revan as potential proof. However, many of these same authorities also believe that such divided adherence would lead unquestionably to madness.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803935" version="1065353216">Commandant Iven</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803935" version="1065353216">Iven first drew the attention of the Imperial Guard as a hardened slave who fought for his life almost daily in the combat arenas of Ziost. Sent to the Imperial Guard academy on Yavin 4, he quickly impressed by dispatching dozens of fellow cadets along with multiple training commandants. But Iven's murderous, unchecked rage was defiant in nature. He resisted the indoctrination process and the Emperor's dark draw longer than any other--until the strain of resistance became too much and his mind snapped.

Once in the Emperor's thrall, Iven became the most ruthless of all the guardsmen, never allowing his intentions to be questioned nor abiding attempts to be reasoned with. In his later years, as a training commandant himself, Iven had a candidate kill rate of over 80 percent, making for a smaller--but ultimately stronger--Imperial Guard.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803936" version="1065353216">The Emperor's Return?</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803936" version="1065353216">In another time, it might have been cause for celebration. It might have emboldened the Empire, breathing new life into their efforts to crush the Republic. But with the Sith Emperor's apparent reawakening comes the common knowledge that he is no longer interested in ruling over the galaxy. Instead, he seeks to consume it.

The Empire's highest ranking officers and dignitaries are now in a state of heightened alert, and the Dark Council has assembled a contingent of powerful Sith seers to get a fix on the Emperor's presence. When he makes his move, it is believed he will not distinguish between former friend or foe, as they will all eventually become his food and none will remain.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803937" version="1065353216">Sith Intelligence</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803937" version="1065353216">Even before the collapse of Imperial Intelligence, the Dark Council yearned for an agency of their own design. With Sith Lord Lana Beniko taking a role equivalent to that of Minister of Intelligence, the council can better ensure that their interests are being met. Beniko's role in uprooting the Order of Revan's agents within the Empire further cements the sound logic of her appointment. Rumors have taken root that Beniko's authority is being shared to some extent with a former commander of Imperial Intelligence, but this has neither been confirmed nor denied.

The primary goals of Sith Intelligence do not appear to have appreciably changed from its predecessor: they exist to gather substantive data on past, present, and future persons and organizations of interest; to quietly develop a stable of varied and valuable assets throughout the galaxy; and, above all, to protect the Sith Empire from threats both without and within.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803938" version="1065353216">Stoneray</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803938" version="1065353216">Of all the creatures indigenous to Yavin 4, the stoneray fits most suitably within its dark side-permeated swamps and jungles. Their ashen skin and low-necked posture lend an air of the sinister. And at night, bathed in the crimson glow of the gas giant Yavin, stonerays appear to be covered in blood--a terrifying sight, especially when one is observed using its taloned tail to effortlessly disembowel its prey.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="803939" version="1065353216">Krakjya</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="803939" version="1065353216">The golden-hued and black-striped pelage of the krakjya instills in those who behold the tropical feline a notion of majestic beauty, but maintaining that affectation would be a mistake. Krakjyas are savage predators, acting only in regard to self-preservation without anything resembling decorum or elegance. Powerful back muscles allow krakjyas to leap great distances and pin down quarry several times their own weight long enough to render it lifeless with their long, sharp teeth. Even the great Massassi warriors of Yavin 4 know better than to face a krakjya without lots of backup.</text>

In fact, the base has become so vital that it has been named after the Sith Empire's first Grand Moff, Odile Vaiken.

Despite its usual complement of several dozen capital warships, Vaiken Spacedock is also one of the Empire's most well-guarded locales. Vaiken is commonly upgraded to the latest in shielding technology and detection sensors, and its vast arsenal has a combined destructive power that could potentially lay waste to a small moon.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="805508" version="1065353216">Indisputably the most corrupt man in the Corellian government, Councillor Torvix gladly signed on to join the Empire when it invaded Corellia. The councillor used his shadowy network of organized criminals and pirates to enforce order in the so-called &quot;Black Hole&quot;--a dangerous section of the Corellian Labor Valley used to process hypermatter, the key fuel for lightspeed travel.

Now both the Republic and the Empire seek to purge Torvix and his forces from the Black Hole. For the Republic, it's a chance to put an end to major conflict on Corellia. And for the Empire, this is an opportunity to squeeze every ounce of value from the war-torn world....</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="805509" version="1065353216">The prison world of Belsavis remains in turmoil. Though the Republic has managed to gain tentative control over much of the main prison complex, agents of the Empire have succeeded in freeing many of their captured comrades and continue to recruit new forces from among the prisoner population to bolster their armies.

In the midst of this continued chaos, a previously-untouched area of the prisons known as Section X has come under brutal assault by minions of the Dread Masters, a cadre of incredibly powerful Sith who have abandoned the Empire to pursue their own mysterious goals. Having experienced the chaos unleashed by the Dread Masters elsewhere, neither faction is interested in waiting to see what they might do with something dug up from the ancient Rakata prison....</text>

Recent victories against the Empire have put morale at an all-time high, but many citizens remain disaffected--especially those who've fought for so long and seen the cost of their leaders' mistakes firsthand. The allure of a new order promising an end to war and the firm leadership of one of the Republic's most famous historical heroes can't be overstated, and the actions of Colonel Darok and his comrades are clear proof that the Revanites have recruited heavily from Republic ranks.</text>

Whether his return from the brink of oblivion is the result of the Emperor's own dark manipulations or merely the result of a terrible convergence of events, his ultimate goal remains the same--to consume all life in the galaxy as fuel for his own immortality.

Despite this chilling turn of events, hope remains. The Emperor's plans have been stopped before, and the Republic is in a stronger position than ever. But the future is always in motion, and the manipulations of the Sith are never predictable....</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="806096" version="1065353216">In response to the Emperor's return, the Republic Strategic Information Service has begun to assemble a joint task force with the sole purpose of finding the ancient Sith ruler and destroying him at last. Initially proposed by SIS agent Theron Shan, the organization will eventually include representatives from the Jedi Order, Republic Special Forces, &quot;paid consultants&quot; from the underworld--anyone who can contribute to the Emperor's downfall.

As with anything in the Republic, it's possible that politics may play a part in the group's final assembly and resources. But given that its founding members witnessed the return of the Emperor firsthand, it's unlikely that anything will be allowed to impede the task force's progress for long.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="806097" version="1065353216">Few beings in the galaxy have seen as many battlefields as Shae Vizla. Her list of victories surpasses even Mandalore himself, and the personal fortune she's amassed after decades as a top-tier mercenary is staggering. The quintessential Mandalorian, Vizla is ruthless in battle, gregarious in close company, and utterly dedicated to perfecting her skills in combat.

Despite (or perhaps because of) her years of success, Vizla has taken fewer and fewer contracts in recent years. Her clan has largely withdrawn from galactic events, sparking rumors that Vizla has had a falling-out with her allies in the Empire, Mandalore, or some other powerful client; others believe she's simply run out of worthy challenges. Whatever the cause, it's questionable whether such a renowned gun-for-hire can remain on the sidelines for long.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="819767" version="1065353216">The Sith Empire had won victory after victory in the Great War. But despite the Sith Emperor's planning, the Empire had also endured setbacks from stubborn Republic defenders. To shatter the Republic's morale, Imperial forces led by the newly-promoted Darth Malgus descended on the peaceful Core World of Alderaan. The surprise attack left Alderaan in flames.

Alderaan was little more than a transfer station for Republic soldiers on leave, though it also had a number of Republic military hospitals. There was no way the Empire could have foreseen that Captain Jace Malcom and Havoc Squad--the Republic's elite Special Forces unit--would be on planet as the attack came. Jace organized an armed stand against the Empire and signaled the Republic.

During an ambush in Alderaan's snowy forests, Captain Malcom and Satele Shan--the Jedi who would become Grand Master of the order--fought and defeated Darth Malgus. The tide was turned; the Republic fleet arrived soon afterwards, securing Alderaan, and the injured Malgus was secretly evacuated by fleeing Imperial forces.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="819768" version="1065353216">To the galaxy's underworld, war means profit. As the Republic and Sith Empire clashed, the Hutt-affiliated Rath Cartel and the upstart Vandelhelm Combine competed to smuggle weapons to the highest bidder in what were later called the Syndicate Wars. 

When both sides hired powerful mercenaries, the rivalry spiraled out of control. Eventually the fighting spilled over into a &quot;back door&quot; trade corridor controlled by the notorious Nok Drayen, a gangster who had destroyed half the Hutt Cartel in a single night. 

With his profits in danger, Nok Drayen swiftly retaliated against both factions. The Rath Cartel and the Vandelhelm Combine soon realized they were out of their depth, as Nok Drayen called in favors from dangerous Gank mercenaries, renegade Hutts and even Imperial officials. Finally Nok Drayen attacked Vandelhelm's headquarters, while simultaneously having the leader of the Rath Cartel assassinated. When the Syndicate Wars were over, every credit Vandelhelm and the Rath Cartel had earned went into Nok Drayen's pocket.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="819769" version="1065353216">Driven to test themselves in war, the Mandalorians had traditionally found common ground with the goals of the Sith. After the Empire's return, a new Mandalore emerged, forged in the gladiatorial arenas of Geonosis, and agreed to an Imperial alliance. Calling his scattered people together, Mandalore assembled a powerful fleet and blockaded the Hydian Way, a critical Republic supply line.

The Core Worlds slowly began to starve, and a partnership of underworld figures led by the smuggler Hylo Visz saw opportunity. The group baited the Mandalorians with bulk freighters of goods, before a motley fleet of starships ambushed the Mandalorian cruisers and forced them to break formation. With support from the Republic Navy, the blockade was destroyed.

As Hylo and her associates grew rich overnight, the Mandalorians withdrew. Dissent was growing in the ranks. Soon, Mandalore himself would face a challenge to his leadership.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="819770" version="1065353216">The Great Hunt--a test of skill, valor and daring--has been a Mandalorian tradition for generations. After the Mandalorian defeat at the Hydian Way, Mandalore organized a Great Hunt to inspire and unite his people. The winner, Artus, challenged Mandalore to a duel and shot him dead. Artus then claimed the title of Mandalore himself, reaffirming the alliance with the Sith Empire.

Several Mandalorian clans, led by the renowned warrior Jicoln Cadera, disagreed. Centuries before, Mandalore the Preserver had fought shoulder-to-shoulder with Jedi and led his people to glory; Jicoln and his clans argued that they should ally with the Republic. When Artus refused, Jicoln Cadera led the clans in an uprising against him.

The two men fought a bloody campaign, but Artus eventually prevailed. He broke the rebels, seizing their armor and ordering their children adopted into other clans. Jicoln Cadera escaped into exile, leaving Artus unchallenged.</text>

For thousands of years, in fact, the craggy, arid world served as the ancient Sith Empire's capital until infighting splintered its leadership. Today, Ziost remains an important commercial, political and population center of the Empire--this in spite of its shift from a warm climate with dense forests to a bitterly cold tundra. Whether this environmental turnabout is due to geological reasons or eons of dark side influence remains a subject of scholarly consideration.</text>

&quot;I took it upon myself to see to a resurgent cell of the Ziost Liberation Front. The guerrilla fighters had been wreaking chaos and destruction in New Adasta, so instead of taking the time to develop assets within the organization, I opted for a more direct approach. However, I was surprised to find upon discovering the location of their headquarters that I wasn't the only one targeting the ZLF cell. Curious, I decided to see how matters would play out without me.

&quot;Rane Kovach displayed determination and guile in his dismantling of the cell, though he did require my assistance in the end. Despite his strong distaste for the ZLF, he maintained a level of calm and rationality that I found appealing. After an extensive background check, as well as mandatory physical and cerebral stress tests, it was my judgment that Rane Kovach would make a valuable Sith Intelligence asset. He does have a tendency to value innocent life over all else to a fault, but I firmly believe he can be made to see that the needs of the Empire ultimately serve the needs of the galaxy as a whole.&quot;</text>

Approached by Agent Theron Shan [REF: ST-66] to infiltrate similar dissident groups, foment revolution while minimizing casualties. Assignments included Jurio, Drezzi. Reassigned upon discovery of possible IMPERIAL INTELLIGENCE reorganization on Ziost. Asset Kovach earned respect, trust of Sith Lord Lana Beniko [REF: BL-172]. Recruited into new SITH INTELLIGENCE headed under Beniko. Has since provided organizational schema, select asset details.

Potential for high-level installation promising. Short-term gains are to be deprioritized against the long term.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="820300" version="1065353216">&quot;There is no contemplation, there is only duty.&quot;

It is a declaration more in line with a rank-and-file soldier than a Jedi, and yet it is a guiding principle of the squad known as the Sixth Line. Their commander, Master Surro, is said to have made the phrase her personal mantra as she waged war against the Empire on the front lines of Balmorra, where her unwavering resolve to accomplish whatever her commanding officers asked of her set her apart from other Jedi.

Details of the formation of the Sixth Line and how they came to work with SIS Agent Theron Shan are sparse. Scattered reports in recent years do suggest that a group of &quot;Jedi commandos&quot; have been involved in raids and strikes not officially sanctioned by the Republic, though the validity of such reportage is typically seen as unreliable.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="820301" version="1065353216">&quot;It is a decision I do not take lightly. Any incursion into Imperial space is fraught with the gravest of danger for every brave soldier who fights in our name. But there is a humanitarian crisis of the highest order on Ziost that demands our attention. When Imperial troops indiscriminately fire upon indentured slaves and helpless civilians, we cannot stand idly by. Those who cannot defend themselves--who have done no wrong yet find themselves under the thumb of the oppressive Sith Empire--must not be left to suffer.

&quot;Someone must fight for them.&quot;

But Monoliths are something beyond Sithspawn: they are everlasting monstrosities built not on a foundation of living tissue but of dark side energy itself.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="820303" version="1065353216">No society is devoid of the potential for raucous dissent from its people, and tightly controlled populations are the most prone to opposition being expressed through horrific acts of violence. Through the centuries, Ziost has been the focus of many attempts at bloody revolution. Though no uprising has been successful to date, their cost in lives, property and stability have taken a toll on the one-time Sith capital.

The most recent revolt came in the form of vicious attacks from the Ziost Liberation Front, a group of guerrilla fighters officially recognized by the Sith Empire as a terrorist organization. The ZLF did not discern between military and civilian targets in their desperate campaign to overthrow the Empire, making the group feared even by those they claimed to be fighting for. They were eventually snuffed out, but not before causing severe damage to New Adasta's infrastructure. As a result of the ZLF's actions, the Empire has taken considerable steps to ensure they can obstruct the acts of a hostile populace in New Adasta with ease and haste, should the need arise.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="820304" version="1065353216">A past shrouded in secrets. A future clouded by uncertainty. It was believed that the once-and-former Sith Emperor sought to consume all life in the galaxy to grant him the dark power required to attain immortality... but is that still the case? Was it ever? Did he actually have another plan all along?

The man now called Vitiate by those who once served him was not strong enough to usurp all life on Yavin 4 after his reawakening. However, he did gain power enough to flee the jungle moon and survive. Now that he has found in Ziost a suitable target to replenish himself--now that he appears to grow more powerful by the hour--what now? When will his unforgiving depletion of Ziost end? And when it does end, what fate will befall the rest of the galaxy?</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="820305" version="1065353216">Global cataclysms are not unheard of. Whole worlds teeming with life have been rendered lifeless by meteorites, broken apart by instability in the planet's own core--even atomized by the destructive force of a supernova. But the eerie calm of a world stripped of life yet left otherwise intact is another matter altogether. Whispered rumors have persisted of planets snuffed out through intricate Sith rituals or by way of deadly, arcane machines--such as the device Revan sought to employ on Yavin 4--but Ziost represents a clear display of the corrosive power of the dark side of the Force taken to its extreme.

In her address to the Galactic Republic, Supreme Chancellor Leontyne Saresh mourned the loss of life, vowing to &quot;stop the mad Sith Emperor at any cost.&quot; Similarly, word has filtered through the Sith Empire that the Dark Council is actively hunting their former Emperor while also working with renowned Sith alchemists on a plan to destroy the one they call Vitiate for good.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="827993" version="1065353216">The rise of the Sith Empire seemed unstoppable. The Republic had suffered vast losses; many worlds were even rebelling to save themselves. So when the Sith Empire suddenly offered to discuss a peace treaty, the Galactic Senate was suspicious--but the Supreme Chancellor could not ignore a chance to end the war.

Delegations from both sides travelled to Alderaan, but in a daring strike, the Empire attacked Coruscant and held the planet hostage. The Supreme Chancellor was forced to sign the Treaty of Coruscant dictated by the Empire, ending hostilities and handing over several apparently insignificant planets. 

Many Sith, including Darth Malgus, were furious. They had believed the treaty was a cunning ruse; it made no sense to actually agree to peace. Many in the Republic, too, believed the treaty was only a delaying tactic before the killing blow. The Treaty of Coruscant had been signed; whether the peace would be kept was a different matter.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="827995" version="1065353216">With the Treaty of Coruscant signed, the war was officially over. But recalling vast armies took time. Meanwhile, many individuals on both sides either didn't believe the treaty was real, or refused to accept it. Skirmishes continued for months, including a bombing attack on the Senate tower.

The Republic had earned a reprieve. Although the war had crippled its military, the Republic quietly poured resources into training small but elite Special Forces squads. Blamed in part for not preventing the Sacking of Coruscant, the Jedi Order left for its ancient homeworld, Tython. There, in secret, the order could rebuild.

With its resources no longer stretched by galactic conquest, the Sith Empire began to secure its new holdings, its citizens jubilant at their victory. However, questions still lingered about why the Empire had not destroyed the Republic when it had the chance. The galaxy settled into an uncertain peace, with both sides watching for any betrayal.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="832280" version="1065353216">The first Massassi warriors to arrive on the fourth moon of Yavin were intelligent beings. However, their utter devotion to Dark Lord of the Sith Naga Sadow rendered moot their capacity for independent thought. To Sadow, the Massassi were born and bred to build temples in his honor and to defend him until death; nothing more. Perhaps it was for this reason that Sadow's experiments in Sith alchemy mutated his followers into rudimentary brutes.

Not all Massassi on Yavin 4 were subjected to Sadow's alchemical manipulations, however. A tribe of clerics who preferred independence over mindless labor turned their backs on their master, quietly venturing out to make a home of their own. These Massassi were pioneers, masters of their own destinies. But if Sadow were to discover their betrayal, there would come a reckoning....</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="832281" version="1065353216">The Massassi War: Part II</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="832281" version="1065353216">As a small tribe of cultured warriors, the intelligent Massassi thrived in the harsh jungles of Yavin 4. For a time they were content with their lives, but contentment led to restlessness. They longed for more. The uncontested rule and grand temples of Naga Sadow called to their warrior's vanity. A plan emerged and the tribe marched on Sadow's territory.

But Sadow, having learned of their independent existence, had anticipated their aggression. His mutated brutes ambushed the would-be usurpers. The sheer magnitude of their blunt-force attack was enough to take down an army. Relying on their wit to improvise and strategize, the smarter Massassi not only protected themselves from the onslaught, but advanced on their goal.

For days, the tribe stormed the temples their devolved cousins built. But where was the Dark Lord they had built them for? They had expected Naga Sadow would face them; they'd even accepted the likelihood most or all would fall to their former master. Instead, wave after wave of mutated brutes attacked and succumbed until there were none left to fight and the tribe stood triumphant inside the greatest of Sadow's temples. It was then, at long last, that Naga Sadow appeared....</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="832282" version="1065353216">The Massassi War: Part III</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="832282" version="1065353216">&quot;You have succeeded,&quot; Sadow declared. &quot;You have defied the odds, killed many times more your own, taken all you so desperately coveted. You have fought and bled and sacrificed to arrive at this moment. All that remains is for you to strike me down. But once you have, what would you do then, without your brothers to murder? With nothing left to conquer on this orb?&quot;

The Massassi slackened, unable to offer a response. There was none to give. &quot;I commend you on the mass slaughter of your own kind,&quot; Sadow intoned as hundreds of Massassi brutes flooded into the temple chamber. &quot;You have seen the pinnacle of your days, the extent of your unchecked avarice. Think of it as the first of two gifts. The other I bestow on you now, though you were meant to have received it along with your fellow Massassi.&quot;

Over time, the Massassi on Yavin 4 grew in number as they rebuilt that which they destroyed. They would never war amongst themselves again.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="878751" version="1065353216">Star Fortress</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="878751" version="1065353216">After Arcann's successful campaign through Republic and Imperial space, he deployed massive battle stations orbiting the planets he most wanted under his control. These Star Fortresses are powered by Sun Generators capable of venting their excess plasma onto the planet below. The threat of instant devastation holds the world populations hostage and serves as a warning to any who might attack the fortress.

Every enslaved world has its own tale of life under the oppressive shadow of a Star Fortress. Some blame the stations for spreading blight and disease through the environment; others have stories of friends incinerated from orbit for daring to speak their minds about Arcann or Zakuul. True or not, freedom will never be restored to the galaxy until Arcann's Star Fortresses are all destroyed.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="878769" version="1065353216">EPHEMERIS Droids</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="878769" version="1065353216">The Eternal Empire of Zakuul doesn't have a population of loyal citizens large enough to fully crew its thousands of warships, much less its gargantuan Star Fortress battle stations. The solution: &quot;EPHEMERIS&quot; droids, advanced multi-tasking machines capable of running every vital system in an operational Star Fortress--and also provide defensive countermeasures should the organic command staff become incapacitated.

Though often mistaken for fully-functional artificial intelligences, EPHEMERIS droids are incapable of independence. These hybrid machines merely combine all the best features of Class 1 mathematics droids, Class 3 administration droids, and Class 4 assassin droids into a lethal and efficient package. Destroying an EPHEMERIS droid will not disable a Star Fortress, but the resulting system failures will greatly reduce the battle station's threat to the planet it orbits.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="878770" version="1065353216">The Exarchs of Zakuul</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="878770" version="1065353216">Alliance spy T7-O1 obtained classified datafiles in the Spire on Zakuul that revealed the existence of an experimental program code-named &quot;Project Exarch.&quot; The goal of this initiative is to enhance the best and most loyal Knights of Zakuul with biological and cybernetic upgrades, creating paragons of the Eternal Empire's sociopolitical ideals--and deadly enforcers of Emperor Arcann's might.

Knights who survive the intensely painful conversion process are given the title Exarch and assigned to command a Star Fortress orbiting one of Zakuul's many conquered worlds. Exarchs are not just military commanders and super-soldiers; they are the unquestioned rulers of planets under their watch and answer only to Arcann himself. In addition to governing conquered worlds, Exarchs are quasi-religious leaders who inspire their subordinates with iconography related to the Old Gods of Zakuul's ancient history.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="878919" version="1065353216">Arcann</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="878919" version="1065353216">Son of Emperor Valkorion, Arcann dreamed of a grander, more exciting future than the privileged life his father gave him. With his older twin brother, Thexan, he joined the Zakuul Knights at a young age, eager to prove himself. In an attempt to gain their father's respect, the brothers proposed a plan to test the strength of the border worlds between Zakuul and the holdings of the Republic and Sith Empire. Valkorion sanctioned the assault, but allowed only Thexan to lead the Eternal Fleet. Defying his father's orders to remain on Zakuul, Arcann joined his brother at the front. Together, they were victorious, but Arcann suffered a serious injury in battle. Valkorion's indifference to their accomplishments pushed him over the edge--he attacked his father, only to be stopped by Thexan. Despite his deep love for his brother, Arcann turned on him and murdered him. Then he set his sights on the Eternal Throne itself....</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879157" version="1065353216">From the moment his daughter, Vaylin, was born, Valkorion felt her strong connection to the Force. As she grew up, the Immortal Emperor noticed similarities between them, which both pleased and frightened him, and he decided to keep a tight leash on his favorite child. Her father's control curbed her tendencies toward violence and anarchy, but beneath her upbeat and lighthearted exterior lurked a restless hunter, hungry and ambitious. When most of the Emperor's power was locked away on Yavin 4, he was no longer able to hide Vaylin's strength from her, and she finally got a taste of her full capabilities. Instead of striking back, however, she decided to bide her time, like a predator studying her prey. She formed a close bond with her brother Arcann as they both detest the idea of destiny. However, Vaylin isn't one to stay in the shadows forever.</text>

The Immortal Emperor is his latest mask and Zakuul his greatest, most ambitious endeavor: an idealistic playground where he can shed his past and experience a new life unburdened by archaic Sith teachings. A manipulative survivor, Valkorion pinpoints the weaknesses of both friends and enemies alike, twisting them to serve his purpose. He believes the entire galaxy is his to shape and will stop at nothing to reach his goals.</text>

Realizing that Asylum couldn't support a permanent base of operations for the Alliance, Lana Beniko began searching for a more appropriate location. Odessen pulled at her through the Force. Unlike with Tython, Korriban or Yavin 4, Odessen's affinity with the Force is balanced, making it the perfect spot for a coalition of Sith and Jedi. Covered in lush wilderness and mountains, the planet is a hidden oasis with a mild climate and a variety of wildlife.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879163" version="1065353216">Home to the Eternal Throne and defended by the Eternal Fleet, Zakuul has become the new superpower in the galaxy. An old civilization reshaped by Emperor Valkorion, Zakuul is technologically advanced, relying mainly on droid labor, with seemingly unlimited resources. All roads lead to the Spire, a sprawling metropolis built on the Endless Swamp. Valkorion's &quot;golden city&quot; symbolizes his victory over the Old Ways of Zakuul. A vertical labyrinth, the Spire is filled with countless neighborhoods, each with its own unique personality. The populace is primarily human, but as the Eternal Empire continues to grow, more aliens are welcomed into the fold.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879164" version="1065353216">Asylum is an uncharted shadowport in Wild Space and a haven for those fleeing Arcann's control. Although out of the Eternal Throne's reach, refugees don't find Asylum an easy place to live. Because its location is unknown to the Eternal Empire, smugglers, pirates, and gangs use Asylum as a base of operations. Rival syndicates wage war in the Free Zone, a black market for goods from all over the galaxy. Street fights are common, and the desperate are easy targets for the port's large criminal element. Looming over Asylum is the Control Spar: the remnants of a long-abandoned mining operation that now acts as the main control center for the port's security defenses and docking management.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879165" version="1065353216">The Eternal Throne</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879165" version="1065353216">The Eternal Throne sits at the top of a starscraper in the center of the Spire. Built by Valkorion over a century ago, the throne not only serves as the Immortal Emperor's seat of power, but is the key to activating and controlling the Eternal Fleet. Valkorion gathered the greatest minds in Zakuul for its construction, which took generations to complete. How and why the fleet responds only to the throne remains a mystery even to the Zakuulan people--only Valkorion and his children know the true answer.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879166" version="1065353216">The Gravestone</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879166" version="1065353216">Centuries before Valkorion's arrival on Zakuul, the Eternal Fleet was in the process of systematically decimating all life in Wild Space. Legend speaks of a single massive, alien warship that could counter the Fleet's might: the Gravestone. Outfitted with specialized weapons designed to take out multiple targets at once, the Gravestone could destroy entire sections of the Fleet--including capital ships--with a single shot. After the final battle, the Eternal Fleet was deactivated and the Gravestone believed to be lost. Zakuulan archeologists have scoured Wild Space for a trace of the old warship, but so far have been unsuccessful.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879167" version="1065353216">The Eternal Fleet</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879167" version="1065353216">The Eternal Fleet is an ancient and unstoppable armada operated by sentient droids and controlled by the Eternal Throne. Centuries ago, the fleet nearly wiped out all of Wild Space. It took a colossal alien warship, the Gravestone, to deactivate the Eternal Fleet, and even it was subsequently lost in the final battle. Valkorion had heard rumors of the fleet before his arrival on Zakuul; it was the main reason he chose the planet to house his new empire. Once he gained control over Zakuul, he began his search for the fleet in earnest, using the Scions' Force visions to eventually find the dormant ships. He built the Eternal Throne to reactivate and command the lost fleet. While primarily used in military operations, the fleet is also key in collecting tributes and resources from conquered planets and protecting trade routes in Wild Space.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879168" version="1065353216">The Old World</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879168" version="1065353216">Zakuulans have always been fascinated by suffering. In ancient times, the Old Ways taught that pain represented the power of the gods. Now, living in a near-utopia, most Zakuulans have never known what it means to suffer. Food, shelter, clothing and education are all provided by the grace of the Emperor. But in the lower recesses of the Spire, called the Old World, citizens can leave their pampered lifestyles behind and pay for the pretense of suffering, placing bets on gladiators in the arena or living out dark fantasies in the red-light district. The Knights of Zakuul have no jurisdiction there, which Arcann allows only because it keeps the privileged docile and content. Located below the Old World is Breaktown, an urban wasteland where an underbelly of outcasts has fled from the Eternal Throne's authority. In this forgotten city's decrepit ruins, debtors, black-market criminals, and those who reject the Emperor set up new pockets of society away from Arcann's prying eyes.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879169" version="1065353216">The Alliance</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879169" version="1065353216">Although the governing bodies of the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic conceded to Arcann's control, not everyone was content with becoming a resource farm for Zakuul. Chief among these rebels were Lana Beniko and Theron Shan. While Theron used his contacts from SIS to amass specialists to aid their fight against Arcann, Lana teamed up with Koth Vortena to break out the legendary Outlander--the only person they believed capable of wrangling so many different parties together under one banner. Although relatively small compared to Zakuul's forces, the Alliance has the Gravestone and experts in multiple fields at their disposal. With proper leadership, this coalition could not only defeat Arcann, but change the galaxy forever.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879170" version="1065353216">The Eternal Empire</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879170" version="1065353216">The Eternal Empire of Zakuul is a totalitarian dictatorship under the Immortal Emperor. Citizens don't merely obey the Emperor--they view him as their timeless guide and protector. By trusting him with all political and military power, they can focus on higher learning and the finer aspects of civilized society. All citizens receive a monthly stipend of credits and resources such as food and fuel. Compared to the rest of the galaxy, the average Zakuulan would be a member of the upper class and want for nothing. They are an idealistic people--scientists, artists and philosophers--who look down on the Sith Empire and Republic, disgusted by their warmongering ways. Instilled with Valkorion's arrogance, they believe it is their burden to bring enlightenment to the rest of the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879171" version="1065353216">Knights of Zakuul</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879171" version="1065353216">Before Zakuulans served the Immortal Emperor, they lived in nomadic tribes, each led by three Force sensitives: Matriarch, Champion and High Shaman. After Valkorion had united the tribes, he repurposed these roles to form the Knights of Zakuul. Officially considered protectors of the people, Knights hunt down corruption in the Eternal Empire. In actuality, they are enforcers of the Emperor's will and fanatical in their adoration for Valkorion and his family. Zakuul Knights don't limit themselves to studying one side of the Force, instead teaching balance and exploration. Knights have their own relationships with the Force, but are encouraged to share their findings with the rest of the order. No area is deemed &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;a dangerous path&quot;--they are all parts of a larger, limitless power. Ultimately, every action a Knight takes is to honor the Immortal Emperor. Sacrifices, whether material or a life, are essential to show one's commitment to the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879173" version="1065353216">Scions of Zakuul</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879173" version="1065353216">Scions are a subgroup of Zakuul Knights who can glimpse the future through the Force. Before Arcann's coronation, they were often paired with other Knights to form a team with both mental and physical prowess. Scions are infatuated with the idea of fate and consider their visions foolproof. Valkorion was content to use this obsession to his advantage, but Arcann detested the Scions, believing them narrow-minded fools. One of his first acts as Emperor was the mass slaughter of Scions, creating a schism in the Zakuul Knights. Some abandoned the order completely, and anyone who spoke out against the new Emperor was cut down by High Justice Vaylin. The surviving Scions, led by Heskal, fled to Asylum, where they waited for the Outlander prophesized to defeat Emperor Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879174" version="1065353216">Heralds of Zildrog</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879174" version="1065353216">Stories of the dragon Zildrog predate Izax's pantheon. In the earliest legends, Zildrog was a guiding mentor who tested the strength of a warrior's spirit. A fallen warrior would be consumed by the dragon, feeding its everlasting power. However, a victorious warrior was rewarded with the Breath of the Dragon. This boon imbued a soul with burning fire, lighting the way to a fortuitous future. During the height of the Old Ways, Zildrog was one of Izax's many forms--a terrible beast that brought only death. To most modern Zakuulans, the dragon is little more than a bedtime story about a mysterious creature in the swamps around the Spire. But a powerful syndicate of zealots in Breaktown who call themselves the Heralds of Zildrog wait for the creature's second coming. Led by the Exalted, the Heralds worship Zildrog as a god and maintain a shaky truce with Emperor Arcann. As long as the Heralds limit their criminal activities to the Old World, the Knights of Zakuul won't meddle in their affairs. However, both parties know this accord is temporary at best. Arcann isn't one to allow dissidence, and the Heralds believe Zildrog's rebirth to be imminent.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879175" version="1065353216">State of the Galaxy</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879175" version="1065353216">With the sudden arrival of the Eternal Empire, the galaxy was turned upside down. The Eternal Fleet struck both the Sith Empire and the Republic at once, first targeting their shipyards, then cutting off supply lines. Within months, Dromund Kaas and Coruscant were blockaded. Without Darth Marr's leadership, the Dark Council scrambled to fight back against Arcann's forces and were ultimately defeated. While most council members were killed, others disappeared to unknown corners of the galaxy. When the dust settled, only Darth Acina remained, and she quickly named herself the new Sith Empress. Even facing this new threat, Supreme Chancellor Saresh couldn't let go of her grudge against the Empire. She tried to wage war against both enemies and failed, costing millions of Republic lives. Finally, the Senate overruled Saresh to discuss a peace treaty with Arcann. She is no longer officially the Supreme Chancellor, but continues to rule from the shadows. Both sides are forced to pay tribute to Zakuul and are technically under a cease-fire, but that doesn't stop them from quietly trying to eliminate one another. As long as tributes are paid on time, Arcann allows the fighting to continue.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879176" version="1065353216">The Old Ways of Zakuul</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879176" version="1065353216">Before Valkorion's rise to power, Zakuul was a backwater planet in Wild Space with almost no contact with the rest of the galaxy. Forced to settle in bogs and swamps, early Zakuulans were a superstitious, nihilistic people who worshipped a pantheon of ruthless gods. These deities expressed their power through the pain and suffering of their followers. The pantheon's father was Izax, the god of death and the Ultimate Devourer. The ancient Zakuulans believed their fate was tied to the will of the gods and belonged to Izax. Those who challenged this view were considered demons. While most Demons were outcasts and expelled from society, a prophecy emerged claiming that one would climb beyond Izax's reach--an immortal god of gods who would topple the pantheon and usher in a new age for Zakuul. Claiming to be the Demon Savior of prophecy, Valkorion began his campaign against the Old Ways.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879206" version="1065353216">Carbonite Freezing</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879206" version="1065353216">Carbonite is a metal alloy that, when mixed with various gasses, can be used to flash freeze blocks of cargo for transportation or storage. Its use in freezing living creatures is relatively new in the galaxy and considered highly dangerous--subjects frozen for more than a few hours have a very low survival rate unless the carbonite is prepared with much expense at an elaborate facility. Even in the best cases, the sudden shock of flash freezing (often combined with a lack of life-support monitoring during suspension) tends to make the process extremely traumatic--sometimes even turning fatal hours after a subject has been thawed.

Still, a quick carbonite spray is the only known technique for freezing living creatures quickly and with minimal preparation. The technology is growing increasingly popular with bounty hunters and smugglers; as a result, many bounty hunting guilds have clauses in their contracts mandating live capture payment even if the bounty fails to survive the post-hibernation period.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879622" version="1065353216">Commerce in the Free Zone</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879622" version="1065353216">The shadowport of Asylum is more than a waystation for Zakuul outcasts fleeing political persecution. Many planets across the galaxy suffer under the Eternal Empire's domination, and their refugees have few safe havens. For fugitives lacking friends or family, Asylum's Free Zone is one of the only places where they can reliably obtain whatever they need to survive on the run.

Everything from freeze-dried Arconan nutrient paste to high-yield thermal detonators is for sale somewhere in the Free Zone, but that's where the convenience ends. Great expense separates Asylum's visitors from the goods they seek. The smugglers and gangsters who control the Free Zone charge exorbitant sums for their wares, forcing already-desperate people to even greater acts of brutality. Indeed, most violent crime on Asylum stems from refugees robbing each other to fund their purchases in the Free Zone.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879623" version="1065353216">The Gravestone's Creators</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879623" version="1065353216">Little is known of the mysterious alien species that designed and built the legendary warship now known solely by its ominous nickname, &quot;the Gravestone.&quot; Records from the dark age of Wild Space history in which the vessel rose to prominence have been lost. Only fragments of centuries-old data remain, describing a vast armada that spread across the sectors to conquer every inhabited world--including Zakuul.

If not for the abrupt appearance of the Gravestone and its destructive Omnicannon, Zakuul might still be enslaved by the conquerors. Though no one knows their species, much less their names, the Gravestone's valiant crew-members fought a desperate battle that left the enemy fleet shattered. The few survivors fled into the darkness beyond the galactic rim, never to threaten Wild Space again.

No one knows what happened to the Gravestone's crew, or exactly how the warship wound up buried in the Endless Swamp of Zakuul. Like the war that spawned the legend, truth remains elusive. Perhaps it always will be....</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="879624" version="1065353216">Koth's Crew</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="879624" version="1065353216">Military deserters from the Eternal Empire like Koth Vortena don't get far without reliable people watching their backs. If not for the aid of his diverse crewmates, Koth likely wouldn't have survived to become the rebel leader he is today--much less one allied with Lana Beniko and the legendary Outlander.

Among Koth's trusted band of roughnecks are his second-in-command Len Parvek, who was a valued subordinate officer serving Koth in Zakuul's army. Len saw many fellow soldiers die in Arcann's unprovoked aggression against the Core Worlds, and was eager to join Koth in rising up against the tyrant. Along the way, Koth and Len found allies like Ralo, a former Republic corporal who was aboard Darth Marr's flagship when it was destroyed, and Tora, a genius engineer whose surly personality has earned her enemies from one end of the galaxy to the other.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="891597" version="1065353216">Firebrand</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="891597" version="1065353216">Anarchist, bomber, folk hero: Firebrand has earned every label. Shortly after her arrival on the Spire, her very public destruction of the District 36 Museum of Art immediately branded her as a dangerous and fashionable terrorist.

Many Zakuulans consider Firebrand a source of much-needed taboo thrills, and her exploits have earned her a sizeable following. Calling themselves Flamechasers, these fans pride themselves on keeping up with her latest daring adventures.

Since only a handful of Flamechasers have seen Firebrand, tales of her appearance range from romantic to outlandish. Her most popular depiction is the mortal incarnation of Aivela, the ancient Zakuulan goddess of passion and fire. Fan art often shows Firebrand as a horned woman engulfed in blue flame, Aivela's traditional portrayal.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="891598" version="1065353216">The Spire</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="891598" version="1065353216">Built on the swamps of Ancient Zakuul, the Spire symbolizes the golden age Valkorion created for his subjects. The towering metropolis comprises vertically stacked and numbered districts, each of which boasts a labyrinth of museums, restaurants, and entertainment designed for maximum enjoyment.

The highest level, District 52, houses the droid command center Overwatch and the opulent Eternal Throne. Below District 1 is Oldtown, which serves as a dark playground where citizens can explore their more unsightly appetites in privacy and safety. Most Spire denizens have visited Oldtown, but few will admit it.

Though Zakuulan society is deliberately classless, many Spire residents use the districts as a status symbol. Those living on levels near the Eternal Throne may boast of a superior &quot;closeness&quot; to the Emperor while districts near Oldtown are considered the slums. In reality, every district is carefully constructed for identical living conditions, just as the Emperor intended.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="891599" version="1065353216">Overwatch</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="891599" version="1065353216">To maintain citizen equality, nearly all menial labor is handled by a droid workforce. Zakuulans rely on it for medical care, construction, law enforcement, and more. Droids provide elderly companionship and safe childcare, and they cook, clean, run errands, and keep the Spire in order. Without droids, the city's comfort and happiness would vanish.

Overwatch is the hub through which all droid labor functions. This command center issues orders to its workers and keeps every droid running smoothly. To reduce human error as much as possible, only those with highest clearance, including the Emperor, are permitted to enter. Automated life-form detection and a patrol of Skytroopers ensure that no one without permission can enter.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="891600" version="1065353216">Raised in comfort and safety, Zakuulans want for nothing. But despite leading easy lives of intellectual and creative pursuits, they occasionally feel compelled to seek out less high-minded excitement.

Oldtown offers an opportunity for Spire citizens to enter another world and indulge their need for exhilaration. Many Zakuulans have paid at least one visit to cheer at the gladiator pits or sample the red light district. Countless more simply venture down to tour the seedy streets and thrill to the distasteful and the taboo.

The key to Zakuulan thrill-seeking is to never face any real danger. Though Spire residents flock to the delightfully seedy Oldtown, they avoid the truly treacherous Breaktown below it.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="892022" version="1065353216">In the ancient days of Zakuul, the Endless Swamps were a harsh home filled with countless dangers. If the deadly predators didn't take the Old Zakuulans, perilous sinkholes and disease-ridden pests would.

Political refugees fleeing Arcann's wrath have often used the swamps for shelter, but the region's population exploded after Asylum's destruction. Zakuulans who oppose the new Emperor are forced to hide in the treacherous lands of their ancestors, fighting for their lives in a murky, deadly world far from the Spire's glamour.

The more superstitious exiles claim to feel the eyes of the old gods watching them from deep within the bog. In reality, these eyes likely belong to the native beasts waiting for their opportunity to strike.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="892024" version="1065353216">Havoc Squad</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="892024" version="1065353216">The founding unit of the Republic Special Forces division, Havoc Squad was renowned as the army's elite fighting team. For a long time, Havoc enjoyed a reputation as a team of unstoppable commandos who always emerged successful against impossible odds. When Havoc fell from grace after a mass unrest in the ranks, a young lieutenant rebuilt the squad and led it to victory once again.

These days, opinions on Havoc Squad are mixed at best. After the disappearance of the officer who led Havoc to its greatest triumphs over the Sith Empire, the elite unit has seen little meaningful action. While many Republic citizens appreciate the squad's past efforts to keep their worlds safe, rumors persist that the commandos have abandoned their posts to fight an unsanctioned guerrilla war on Zakuul--one that threatens the fragile peace treaty with the Eternal Empire.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="895494" version="1065353216">Death comes for all; the Jedi and Sith are no exception. Yet some who master the Force seem to find ways to resist the call of eternity and exist as an essence of their former selves. In this form, they may speak with the living and guide--or manipulate--old friends and former enemies.

The most notable example in recorded Sith history is Darth Vax, a prominent member of the Dark Council. After her death, she was unable to let go of the power and influence she enjoyed during life. When her son took her vacant seat on the Council and assumed the title of Darth Arrid, she began manipulating him behind the scenes, making him a puppet for her own agenda. Four years passed before the Council realized the young Darth Arrid was only a mouthpiece for the spirit of his mother.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="895495" version="1065353216">To the Jedi, the Force is a partner to be respected. For the Sith, it's a power to be harnessed. Others believe the Force can reach far beyond the narrow scope of these two opposing factions. These philosophies aren't always so black and white. 

In remote corners of the galaxy, far from the influence of the Republic or Empire, those sensitive in the Force develop their own beliefs and values. In the Valau tribe of Nagoa, Force sensitives are considered to be marked by the gods, chosen to act as instruments of their gods' wills. Valau Force wielders undergo an intense ritual to shed their previous identities and act solely as conduits for these gods. The concept of light and dark is irrelevant. The will of the gods is unquestionable, and the Force is simply a tool to enforce it.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="895498" version="1065353216">When the Republic bowed to the Eternal Empire, Grand Master Satele Shan renounced her title and vanished. Though there exists no official record of her whereabouts or actions following her disappearance, possible sightings have led to strange speculation.

A summary of sightings reported to the SIS:

- A woman matching Satele's description was seen entering an ancient temple on Yavin 4. When she emerged, she was speaking to an unseen listener--or perhaps to herself.

- Intercepted outgoing messages reveal Satele's son, Agent Theron Shan, made a single attempt to contact her. No reply was sent, but records show the message was opened on Ziost.

- A bug planted on a Zakuulan patrol ship shows records of an unmarked vessel entering Wild Space. The patrol conducted a search and recorded a single human passenger. Lifeform scans, however, suggested there were two beings present on the ship. No explanation was made for the discrepancy, and the woman's identity was not reported. The patrol ship crew could not recall the confrontation.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="895499" version="1065353216">An excerpt of notes from Dr. Juvard Illip Oggurobb:

The creatures appear predatory in nature, exhibiting highly aggressive tendencies. In my studies, they do not consume the flesh of their kill. They simply enjoy the hunt. In fact, shade stalkers do not seem to eat at all. Can a living organism really survive without sustenance? It's almost beyond comprehension!

These magnificent beasts seem directly tied to the strong Force presence on Odessen. Whether they were born of the conditions or simply corrupted by them remains to be seen. Their scaly hides indicate a defense against aggressors, suggesting these creatures may not have always been so predatory. My conjecture is that their natural course of evolution was somehow rapidly thrust forward by an unknown process. Could the Force be responsible? And if so, could this mean the Force can similarly affect the evolution of other species? Can we harness such a process for our own gain? 

I must study this further.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="895500" version="1065353216">Though not limited exclusively to caves, this subspecies of jurgoran is usually found in environments with little-to-no natural light. In order to adapt to its dark surroundings, the cave jurgoran has developed bioluminescent scales and a reflective hide. Each creature has a distinct glow pattern, nearly undetectable to most, but instantly recognizable by other cave jurgorans.

It is currently unknown how the jurgoran managed to migrate out of Dromund Kaas and settle in the darker corners of the galaxy. The most common theory among biologists is that the early Sith used jurgorans in battle but found them unpredictable and deserted them like forgotten pets. If this theory is correct, the cave jurgorans of today are descendants of these abandoned tools of war.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="896454" version="1065353216">To bring a society from oppressive tribalism into a glorious golden era requires significant funding. When Emperor Valkorion began his project, he funneled wealth from the Sith Empire into Zakuul, effectively robbing one empire to fund another. As Valkorion's grand society blossomed, the Eternal Empire turned its view outward, conquering planets and claiming their resources. By the time the Republic and Sith Empire fell, Zakuul had amassed the greatest fortune in the galaxy.

Much of it is channeled directly into Zakuul--expansion of the Eternal Fleet, lavish updates to the Spire, generous gifts to the citizens--but the Empire's treasure is so great, it couldn't possibly be spent entirely. The bulk now sits idle aboard the massive treasury called the Gilded Star, serving as a symbol of Zakuul's status--and a reminder of the Eternal Empire's power.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="896455" version="1065353216">Identity Slicers</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="896455" version="1065353216">When the scum of the galaxy need a solid escape, they place themselves in the capable but expensive hands of an identity slicer. Creative, intelligent, and resourceful, these forgers can alter the identity of anyone with enough credits. A skilled ID slicer can even modify genetic code itself. Such precision takes years to master; many consider themselves artists and scientists, albeit unconventional ones.

Since identity slicing is highly illegal, forgers are notoriously reclusive. Isolation from the outside world causes personality quirks that can sometimes develop into mental imbalance. The most notable example was Dalan Reid, a veteran forger who, after twelve years of isolation, began constructing dozens of replicas of HoloNet singer Viella Zall using local wildlife. Reid was finally caught when he used his Viella clones to hold an impromptu concert on Tatooine.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="896498" version="1065353216">The galaxy suffers. The Eternal Empire conquers and plunders countless worlds, adding to Zakuul's vast wealth.</text>

He commissioned a version of sabacc played entirely through holo, eliminating physical cards. When Jar'ga unveiled the first holo-sabacc table at casino on Nar Shaddaa, it sparked a craze of galactic proportions. Soon every casino in known space had at least one holo-sabacc table.

Of course, it didn't stop cheaters in the slightest. Slicers immediately set to work creating stacked holo-decks and altering card algorithms. Sliced holo-sabacc systems can now be purchased at the black markets on every major world. Jar'ga himself has a sliced holo-sabacc table hidden in his casino--stacked, of course, in the dealer's favor.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="898389" version="1065353216">Notes from Doctor Juvard Illip Oggurobb:

Due to the rapid escalation of evolution observed on Odessen, I have imported creatures from other planets and released them into the wilds to monitor the effects.

The sleen, extracted from the jungles of Dromund Kaas, exhibited a marked increase in agility and reaction time. Perhaps this creature's serum could be used to make performance-enhancing adrenals.

From Makeb, I secured a fine makrin specimen with the intent of studying its adaptability. As predicted, this remarkable species altered the texture of its skin to better mirror the sturdy hardwoods of Odessen forests.

The Taris bogstalker saw the most shockingly rapid evolution thus far. The creature developed an incredible predatory feature: a plasteel-like barb at the end of its tail. It has evolved enough to warrant a new breed, which I call the &quot;steel-tailed stalker.&quot;

I've allowed the creatures to continue their existence on Odessen, as I hope to further observe their acclimation.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="900266" version="1065353216">Firsthand account from Ralia of Clan Lok:

The Skytroopers surrounded us. Two dozen, blasters aimed at our heads. We had already begun our death roar.

And then Mandalore the Vindicated cut through them, scattering their metal parts. He ordered us to rejoin the clan and leave the Skytroopers to him. But the droids had called for backup; suddenly, dozens were swarming him.

Mandalore dismantled them two at a time with a war cry like thunder. They kept coming, waves and waves, till we could no longer see him. I started to charge forward, but Droga stopped me. &quot;He's already gone.&quot;

He was Ardus Lok. My brother, our Mand'alor. And he fell to machines. He will not be honored.

I pray to Kad Ha'rangir this pointless war will end soon.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="900267" version="1065353216">Quick to anger and even quicker to throw a punch, Khomo Fett lives for the thrill of battle. His combat skill has let him outlive the average Mandalorian commander, earning him the nickname &quot;Old Man&quot; among his fellow warriors. Before Zakuul's invasion, Khomo forged a small commando unit into the strongest and most feared mercenaries in the system. But Khomo's eagerness to drive Zakuul away led him to take foolish risks, and Khomo lost nearly all of his loyal troops to the Skytroopers.

When Mandalore the Vindicated fell, Khomo's name was put forward as the obvious choice as successor. But the seasoned warrior refused the position, disgusted at the thought of planning battles rather than fighting them. Instead, he acts as Shae Vizla's eyes and ears on the battlefield. His fierce loyalty to his people earned Shae's confidence, and he quickly became one of her most trusted leaders.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="900268" version="1065353216">The Mandalorian death ceremony--kote kyr'am or &quot;glory death&quot;--is reserved for those who die with the highest honor. Traditionally, only warriors who have fallen to Jedi or faced impossible odds are awarded the kote kyr'am.

To ensure the warrior's spirit can join those of other Mandalorian paragons, the body is burned on an elevated pyre. Clan members send shouts into the sky, bellowing war cries and retelling feats. The night becomes a celebration of drunken feasting and brawling in honor of the dead.

The only non-Mandalorian to receive the kote kyr'am was Lord Raze, a Sith warrior who fell while singlehandedly rescuing a Mandalorian clan from a battalion of twenty Jedi on Dantooine. The clan was so moved by her skill and fearlessness, they broke tradition and honored her as a fallen sister. No outsider has received such a distinction since.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="900273" version="1065353216">Even among Mandalorians, Shae Vizla is legendary. In her younger years, she was a ruthless bounty hunter, racking up high-profile kills, from crime lords to politicians.

Her brutal assassination of Senator Keenig caught the attention of Darth Malgus himself, earning her a partnership with the Sith Empire. Shae's skill and efficiency led her to join the Empire's biggest campaigns against the Republic. She was present for the assault on Alderaan--according to rumors, she saved Malgus from certain death. Regardless, she earned Malgus's trust enough to play a vital role in the sacking of Coruscant.

After over a decade working for the Empire, Shae retired to Rishi, where she earned the local nickname &quot;Torch.&quot; She carefully avoided the war and distanced herself from the Mandalorians until the Eternal Empire's invasion thrust her back into the fray once again.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="900274" version="1065353216">When Mandalore the Vindicated fell in battle against the Eternal Empire, Shae Vizla reluctantly assumed leadership over the clans. She had sizable shoes to fill: the fallen Mandalore was popular, respected, even revered. As a lone hunter, Shae had very little experience leading people, much less an entire culture.

With the clans fractured and beaten down after years of war with Zakuul, Shae had to adapt quickly to bring her people together. She proved to be just the leader the Mandalorians needed. Her introductory battle as Mandalore the Avenger was the clans' first victory in six months.

With her impressive track record and ruthless combat tactics, Shae is perfectly suited for wartime leadership. Yet some believe the battle-hardened Mand'alor isn't fit to lead long-term, and the end of the war may see more than one challenge for her title.</text>

When the Eternal Empire invaded the remote world, only the Hutt Cartel's hired mercenaries were present to fend them off. The Eternal Fleet easily drove the Hutts away and claimed the planet.

Now Darvannis is home to one of the largest factories in Zakuul's possession, manufacturing ships, weapons, and the countless Spire droids. Located beneath kilometers of tunnels and heavily defended, the Darvannis factory has been impenetrable since it fell into the Eternal Empire's hands. Even the Hutts grudgingly admit the Empire has done extraordinary things with the desolate planet. When asked, however, the Cartel insist they presented Darvannis as a gift to Zakuul, desperate for the galaxy to think they still hold a measure of power.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="906634" version="1065353216">For easier control, GEMINI droids operate through a single collective consciousness. An order issued from the Eternal Throne is not sent to an individual droid, but to the hive mind for assignment to the best-suited unit. While each droid retains a limited sense of individuality, she acts more like an appendage of a singular brain than an individual connected to a network.

GEMINI droids share thoughts, reactions, and instincts. Every GEMINI feels when one unit's pain receptors fire. A single GEMINI's destruction is experienced by the entire fleet. A droid's existence does not end with deactivation; its consciousness is absorbed into the hive mind for redistribution. If a new chassis isn't available, the consciousness remains in the hive mind, waiting. Unless every GEMINI unit is destroyed, the Eternal Fleet's squad of captains can exist indefinitely.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="906640" version="1065353216">A teen idol turned superstar, Malita Tal has been a household name on Zakuul for most of her life. Though millions watch her HoloNet performances, it's her humanitarian and environmental work that truly inspires her devoted fans. The singer's dedication to preserving Zakuul's wildlife led to the creation of the Malita Tal Environmentalism Award, celebrating efforts to restore natural ecosystems.

Malita was one of the first Zakuulans to publicly speak against Emperor Arcann's rule. When her fans followed her lead and organized rallies opposing Arcann, terrorist correspondence was suddenly discovered on Malita's personal holoterminal, likely planted by Zakuulan officials. Malita's exile from Zakuul on suspicion of treason divided her fans. While some condemn their former icon as a traitor, many supporters remain hopeful she will return.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="906641" version="1065353216">From the court-martial of Admiral Dannis Veriga, Republic Fleet:

When the Eternal Fleet came for Alderaan, we thought we were prepared. The Republic planned for a naval invasion. What we got was a massacre.

The enemy suddenly dropped out of hyperspace. There were hundreds of them, a massive wall of ships moving as one. I've never seen such a fluid formation. When we shot a vessel down, the others closed in and sealed the gap. Like the fleet was healing a wound.

They were relentless. We fought with everything we had, but barely scratched the enemy. It was like the entire fleet had a single pilot.

So yes, I ordered the retreat. Even then, only half of us survived. There's no stopping them. Why die trying?</text>

While the rest of the fleet is piloted by GEMINI droid captains, the Eternal Flagship is operated by the most skilled and zealous humans in the empire.

Famously, the Eternal Flagship transported Arcann and Thexan to battle during their conquest of the Core Worlds. The flagship swiftly knocked out Balmorra's planetary defense system, allowing the twin princes to capture the world's weapon factories intact. In recognition of this momentous victory, the flagship's crew was awarded Zakuul's highest honor, the Medal of Eternal Valor, by none other than the Immortal Emperor Valkorion.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="910300" version="1065353216">Even as a child, Tora had a knack for engineering--and for attracting trouble. At eleven, she built a miniature droid to cheat on her math exam and another to hurl dirt at the classmate who ratted her out. She was promptly suspended and placed in counselling to treat her &quot;antisocial behavior.&quot;

In adulthood, Tora's short career as a swoop racer ended on Nar Shaddaa when she attempted to cheat by repurposing thermal detonators into turbo boosters. The track was destroyed and several racers were injured when the detonators backfired and exploded mid-race. Tora was miraculously ejected from the wreckage, but the swoop racers pooled their credits and placed a bounty on her head.

Forced to flee Hutt Space, Tora offered her engineering services to the first ship captain leaving the moon: Koth Vortena.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="910301" version="1065353216">The Alliance's first line of defense is the Odessen planetary shield. This defense grid protects the Alliance base and the surrounding area from turbolaser bombardments and other aerial attacks. Although walkers and ground troops can slip through the shield, the defense grid ensures the Eternal Fleet cannot wipe out the Alliance with a single devastating bombardment.

The shield's construction was spearheaded by Doctor Oggurobb, the Alliance's sharpest scientific mind. When Oggurobb conducted early stress tests on the shield, Fleet Admiral Bey'wan Aygo bet that his strongest battleship could break through the fledgling defense grid. Fortunately for Oggurobb, the shield held strong--and Bey'wan is still paying off his debt.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="910313" version="1065353216">Even among the fervent Exarchs of Zakuul, Malforia was famed for her fanaticism. She presided over the star fortress above Balmorra with an unmatched ferocity, bolstered by her strict adherence to Zakuul's old ways. Her fixation with Tyth, the Zakuulan god of rage, was so great that she adopted his bloody fist symbol as her personal sigil. Malforia's ruthless actions in Tyth's name, including the slaughter of more than three dozen Balmorran officials, earned her widespread infamy.

When the spymaster known as the Shroud heard of Malforia's fervor, his replicator droids destroyed the Balmorran star fortress and captured the Exarch so he could study her Zakuulan fanaticism.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="910314" version="1065353216">The Shroud's latest base of operations, the Coil was constructed in a previously uncharted section of Wild Space. When the Eternal Empire rose to power, the Shroud moved his compound to Obus VI to monitor Zakuul and influence the politics of Wild Space.

The planetoid that houses the Coil is surrounded by the strongest scrambling field credits can buy. This field prevents any communication without the Shroud's consent, but also leaves the entire planetoid undetectable to scanners, probes, and holo-cameras.

The Coil's three layers each have their own security clearance. Low-impact operations are run on the asteroid level and high-risk missions occur in the underground volcano level. Staff are prohibited from moving between levels, or even interacting with staff from other levels.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="910315" version="1065353216">Since its invention in 13 BTC by scientist Reyne Flavius, the vibro-mop has been a vital component of hygienic maintenance throughout the galaxy. Integrating the versatility of a vibro-blade with the dependability of a household mop, it served as a template for a new and exciting array of cleaning apparatus, including the electromagnetic duster and the ion-charged dishrag.

Though the vibro-mop is primarily utilized in small-scale household sanitation, it has played a role in many of the greatest feats of sterilization in the galaxy. The cleanup following Drooga the Hutt's historic 600th birthday celebration owed its success to a single vibro-mop, which expired after the completion of its titanic task. Drooga's janitorial staff held a private ceremony to honor the tool's heroic service.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="910316" version="1065353216">Replicator Droid</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="910316" version="1065353216">A primary tool in the infamous Shroud's espionage network, a replicator droid can use holographic projection and voice modulation to assume the identity of any organic or synthetic being stored in its databanks. The true origin of replicator droids is uncertain, though some speculate the Shroud stumbled across lost alien tech years ago and leveraged it to build his clandestine empire.

Both the Republic and Empire have invested heavily in research projects to create their own versions of replicator droids, but have achieved only limited success. On the rare occasions one of the Shroud's replicator droids was identified and captured intact, self-destruct protocols automatically fried the relevant circuits and preserved their master's secrets.</text>

Status: Dormant

For most of its existence, the Dust Viper gang was a minor criminal organization operating out of the Jundland Wastes on Tatooine. Their members primarily conducted raids on moisture farming settlements. Their most &quot;successful&quot; ambush outside Mos Pelgo resulted in the theft of a dozen astromech droids, most of them hours away from the scrap pile. The Dust Vipers were destined to be forgotten until noted criminal Bel Nerodia took command of the gang.

Under Nerodia's leadership, the Dust Vipers became a significant threat to the local population--and eventually the entire system. They established a new base near Anchorhead and struck major trade routes. Over several months, they established a small pirate squadron and attacked convoys across the Outer Rim. As the Dust Vipers gained wealth, more criminals flocked to their ranks. The amateur group had evolved into a significant criminal threat.

One question remains: how did the Dust Vipers--a dangerous but ultimately primitive organization--manage to successfully intercept a secret Alliance patrol and steal classified security data? Luck may be a factor, but their coordination suggests otherwise. Intelligence will continue to investigate.</text>

Status: Terminated

Alliance Intelligence tracked Major Korven for several months before the events on Vanguard Station. Known as Cipher Fourteen when she worked for Imperial Intelligence, she earned numerous commendations for her service... along with several reprimands for using methods considered too extreme, even by Sith standards. 

Ruthless, ambitious, and amoral to a fault, her career eventually stalled when other agents refused to work with her because of her endless backstabbing and double-dealing in pursuit of her own advancement. Ostracized, she disappeared, though she was since a suspect in several anti-Imperial terrorist acts.

Given her dangerous reputation, Alliance agents investigated rumors of Major Korven resurfacing. Pinning down her exact location proved difficult until her sudden appearance as a leader of the Sith defectors on Vanguard Station. It remains unclear why anyone would follow someone with Korven's well-known, and well-deserved, reputation for betraying her own people.</text>

Status: Terminated

By the time the Sith bowed to the Eternal Empire, Lord Adacin and her constant companion Lord Zanisk had already recognized their new enemy's strength and disappeared. When Acina brokered a truce with Arcann and took power, they remained hidden rather than join the influx of Dark Lords swearing fealty to the new Empress to save their own skin.

Given their earlier foresight and caution, their sudden aggression against the Alliance is troubling. Why expose themselves with an open and direct attack? Why target the Alliance, rather than slowly draw more Sith away from Acina to bolster their ranks? Was there some ulterior motive--some greater purpose--behind their actions that we haven't discovered?

Even the location of their volcanic stronghold raises questions. Adacin and Zanisk had no previous connection to Ord Mantell. How did they set up their operations so quickly without drawing unwanted attention? And why would they even want their base on a world neither of them was familiar with?

Though we believe the threat they represent has been neutralized, too many unanswered questions remain to completely close this file.</text>

Status: Dormant

The recent White Maw resurgence on Hoth may benefit the Alliance. After defeating the pirates and liberating the civilian workers, we have established a legitimate claim to the Firefrost Lavaworks factory they used. Alliance crews are already modifying the factory for our specific purposes. 

Further White Maw aggression in the area is unlikely, as Droub--the Firefrost overseer--seems to have solidified his position and eliminated any potential rivals in the region. His rise to power was impressive and unexpected: before this, he was little more than a mid-level White Maw thug, lacking the ambition and intelligence to set up such an extensive operation.

Interviews with the civilians pressed into service indicate Droub was a particularly cruel master. Because of this, a high percentage of the workers have vowed to stay on and keep the facility running on behalf of the Alliance as a sign of their gratitude.</text>

Elarea Aldraste was a moderately successful bounty hunter working primarily in Wild Space before leading the Crimson Fang organization that seized control of Port Nowhere. Calling herself the Red Huntress, she had a reputation for bringing back her quarry exclusively in body bags. She occasionally partnered with other small-time operators on difficult jobs, however nothing in her history shows the leadership necessary to found an organization capable of seizing such a prized target.

And yet, the Crimson Fang was a veritable rogues' gallery of Wild Space's most notorious villains. Confirmed members included renowned sniper Jor &quot;Oneshot&quot; Mesok, the infamous pirate Captain Takkan Russco, and the twin assassin droids KT-55 and PR-98... none of whom survived. 

How the Red Huntress convinced such a disparate group to unite and seize control of Port Nowhere is still under investigation. One fact is clear: without Elarea at the helm, the Crimson Fang would have collapsed.</text>

Status: Unsubstantiated

As a rising power in the galaxy, it is inevitable that the Alliance will encounter opposition from various factions. However, analysis of several recent incidents has brought to light a number of striking similarities. In many cases, a small group of criminals or political defectors under the control of an unlikely leader has quickly risen to prominence without warning. 

These unexpected outbursts of dissension could be simple coincidence. They may also be mere symptoms of some flaw in Alliance political policy that is inciting these hostilities. However, we must also consider the more sinister possibility that these uprisings are all somehow connected.

The emerging pattern of these seemingly random events make more sense if considered as part of a greater, concealed whole. It may be the enemies we have faced were merely pawns, set against us by a more cunning and formidable foe to test our responses while chipping away at our strength. However, until Alliance Intelligence can find concrete evidence, this theory remains pure speculation.</text>

However, when Darth Marr's death at the hands of the Eternal Empire incited panic and infighting among the surviving council members, Acina was the first to understand the Sith were overmatched. 

She declared loyalty to Arcann and--allegedly--helped him eliminate several council members who refused to bow before the Eternal Throne. With her rivals out of the picture, Acina declared herself Empress of the Sith, and Arcann publicly acknowledged her claim. Whispered gossip suggested their relationship went much deeper than mere political alliance, though little exists to substantiate those rumors.

Some accused Acina of cowardice, but the cunning Sith was merely biding her time. With Arcann's fall and the growing strength of the Outlander's Alliance, Acina saw a chance to strike back at her conquerors, and her open defiance of Empress Vaylin heralds an end to the era of Sith submission.</text>

Over a long but unspectacular career, he rose to the position of Moff and served as deputy commander aboard the Ascendant Spear--a prototype Sith warship.

Moff Lorman's career seemingly ended when he was officially blamed for the loss of the Ascendant Spear after it was destroyed by the infamous Republic operative Theron Shan and Jedi Master Gnost-Dural. However, as attrition from a prolonged series of setbacks and defeats in the war against Zakuul thinned the Imperial ranks, Lorman once again found favor with his superiors.
 
His perplexing promotion to the role of Imperial Minister of Logistics proves the following adage: when all around you are failing, simply doing nothing at all looks like success.</text>

When Koth was relieved of command for refusing to fire on unarmed civilians during the Denon riots, Len recognized a kindred spirit in his captain. He freed Koth from the brig and smuggled him to safety aboard the Asylum space station. When Koth later joined the underground resistance opposing Arcann's rule, Len remained faithfully at his friend's side.

Reliable and unassuming, Len's even temperament is the perfect complement to the extroverted and impulsive Koth. Though Koth's crew have nothing but admiration for their visionary leader, they typically turn to Len to handle the nuts-and-bolts of their captain's often outrageous plans.</text>

Unlike Arcann, his volatile brother, Thexan was known for remaining calm and composed in even the most trying circumstances... a trait that quickly made him their father's favorite son.

But Thexan refused to let their father sow seeds of dissension among him and his siblings. When Valkorion imprisoned his own daughter, Thexan was the only family member who regularly visited his banished sister. After Thexan was chosen to lead the Eternal Fleet against the Core Worlds, he invited Arcann to join him so they could conquer their enemies together.
On their return, however, Valkorion refused to acknowledge his sons' victories. Arcann finally snapped and attacked the Immortal Emperor. Thexan intervened, only to be struck down by Arcann in his blind fury.

Zakuul mourned the fall of their beloved prince for an entire year. His tragic death was blamed on injuries suffered during the war, though rumors suggest he actually fell during a power struggle with Arcann--a theory no one dares admit in public.</text>

Built by the same unknown species that created the GEMINI droids and the Gravestone, ARIES's original purpose was to oversee and coordinate advanced warfare simulations. ARIES continued in that role by reprogramming the resources of Iokath--including the massive population of service droids--for military purposes.

Isolated and hidden from the rest of the galaxy, Iokath has received few visitors in the past centuries.

He managed luxury cruisers, organized planet-wide festivals, and ultimately won the public's favor for officiating the spectacular execution of High Justice Yuriem for the crime of profaning the Immortal Emperor's name.  

But Indo's rise to prominence was not always written in the stars. His parents, both decorated Knights of Zakuul, died in the Battle of Scyva when Indo was only six years old.  He was raised by his older sister, Kalya--one of Zakuul's prophetic order of Scions. It was Kalya who taught Indo how to influence people, act like the Zakuulan elite, and navigate the social labyrinth of the Eternal Empire. Indo worshipped his sister until the day she was executed by High Justice Vaylin during a mass slaughter of Scions. 

Indo was destroyed. He wanted nothing more than to avenge his sister's death. But Kalya had taught him the value of patience. Indo swallowed his rage, donned a smile, and insinuated himself into Vaylin's employ--dreaming of the day he would bring down the Zakuulan empress.</text>

Jarak believes personal suffering is insignificant compared to better understanding the mind and uses methods that make other behavioral psychologists squirm. But while his colleagues disapprove of his grisly techniques, they cannot argue with the results. 

Years ago, Jarak invented a gruesome method of brainwashing patients to obey any command for up to ten hours. Side effects included hives, delirium, and death in nine out of ten patients--but everyone from Hutt crime lords to private military organizations still lined up to recruit the scientist.

During a trip to the distant northern continent, Dramath had an affair with a poor farmer woman, siring a son whom he promptly forgot.

Ten years later, the Sith Lord heard rumors of a child gathering power in the northern continent, but did not personally investigate until his envoys failed to return. After days of travel, Dramath reached the source of the rumors only to face his illegitimate son, Tenebrae, the future Sith Emperor and immortal ruler of Zakuul. That day, Tenebrae removed his father's connection to the Force and imprisoned him within a powerful holocron, leaving Dramath alone to wither slowly into madness over an eternity.</text>

A massive sphere constructed around--and fully enveloping--an undersized and unremarkable star, Iokath absorbs all of the energy released by its &quot;sun,&quot; maximizing solar efficiency.

All the orbital bodies in the system--every planet, moon, and asteroid--were demolished and salvaged for core elements to create this technological marvel. The salvage was processed and repurposed to create a self-sustaining ecosphere that could be altered and expanded to meet the ever-changing needs of the builders and their society. The self-contained nature of Iokath allows for complete control and customization of every aspect of the environment--a theoretically perfect world.

With the system's star hidden by the surrounding sphere, Iokath is undetectable from a distance, and its impenetrable exterior defenses make it virtually unassailable. Combined with the technological superiority of the builders, it was impervious to any outside threat... but Iokath couldn't protect itself from enemies within.</text>

Long before assuming his current form, Valkorion was a Sith pureblood named Vitiate born on the lush and vibrant world of Medriaas. Vitiate rose to become Emperor of the Sith and ruled for over a thousand years--but only after extracting a terrible price.

Early in his reign, Vitiate invited thousands of the most powerful Sith Lords to his homeworld, then wiped out his would-be challengers in a profane dark side ritual that annihilated all life on the planet. Even the Force could not survive. The void that remained after the ritual brought pain and suffering to any Force-sensitive beings that approached. 

The name Medriaas was purged from the galactic record and the barren planet became known as Nathema. Centuries later, Valkorion banished his daughter Vaylin to the blighted world, knowing the void would limit her growing power and make her more susceptible to the mental conditioning he could use to control her... if it didn't drive her mad.</text>

The Sanitarium is home to a mysterious sect of Force-sensitives called the Nathema Zealots, though day-to-day order is maintained by the Keepers--specially trained Abyssin who serve as guards and caretakers. The halls are also patrolled by mutated creatures from other worlds that are genetically engineered to instill fear, terror, and obedience in the Sanitarium's unwilling residents. The operation is overseen by an Anomid scientist named Jarak--an outcast among his own kind for the deviant nature of his research.

Their alliance has proven surprisingly effective, with the meditative reserve of the Voss complimenting the ferocious strength of the Gormak to form a formidable army. However, tension divides their ranks.

A particular point of dispute is the ratio of Gormak casualties, with most Gormak leaders claiming their own losses are far too low. Casualties among the two species are nearly equal even though the bulk of the frontline troops are Gormak. 

This may be because Voss strategy is shaped by an ancient decree from the Mystics stating &quot;the last Gormak must not die.&quot; But as one Gormak shaman complained, &quot;Gormak fight. Gormak die. Gormak win. Voss stop Gormak dying, Voss stop Gormak winning.&quot;</text>

Service in the Horizon Guard is simultaneously a blessing and a curse. While it is a great honor to be chosen for the Empress's personal detail, Horizon Guards are likely to suffer the violent outbursts of Vaylin's erratic temper.

Arcann's cull of the Scions created a rift among the previously loyal Knights of Zakuul, and a resistance group formed when Zakuulans began to doubt their new emperor. Now Vaylin's harsh regime has further divided her subjects. The rebels that rose under her brother's rule have grown in both numbers and resolve, threatening to tear down the Eternal Empire.

The rebels ultimately tried to assassinate Vaylin on the eve of her coronation as Empress of Zakuul. Hundreds of resistance cells carried out a careful plan over a number of years. But unknown to the rebels, Vaylin had monitored them since her days as High Justice. While she celebrated her ascension to the throne, her deadly Horizon Guards ambushed the traitors and thwarted their assassination plan. Many rebels died, but more were captured. They were interrogated and left to rot in servitude--until Vaylin found the perfect stage for their public execution.</text>

However, while their mental conditioning focuses their power, it simultaneously erodes their free will.

This was not accidental, as Valkorion sought to create an army of completely subservient yet incredibly powerful Force users. However, one unexpected side effect was that the Nathema Zealots grew dependent on the void for their existence, and became catatonic if they left Nathema's surface.

Hoping to extract some value from his failed experiment, Valkorion used the Nathema Zealots as wardens for the prisoners he sent to Nathema's Sanitarium. He also recruited the Anomid scientist Jarak to study their mental conditioning so he could use it to control his daughter Vaylin.</text>

At her coronation, a dozen Knights of Zakuul were publicly executed for failing to protect her predecessor. Vaylin carried out the sentences herself, personally congratulating each victim on the great honor of dying at her exalted hand.

The casual cruelty of their new ruler shocked Zakuul's citizens. More importantly, it drew focus away from the strange droid serving as Vaylin's top advisor, and distracted people from the sudden desertion of nearly a third of the Eternal Fleet.

It remains to be seen whether Vaylin's harsh tactics will cow her people into obedience, or ignite the flames of true rebellion.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="936079" version="1065353216">As one of her first acts as Empress of Zakuul, Vaylin declared a bounty on her own mother, who had fled into the far reaches of the galaxy with a badly injured Arcann. A deluge of rumors and unverified reports flooded in from those eager to claim the reward. Obsessed, Vaylin pursued each one, calling on the full resources of the Eternal Empire to track down her quarry.

Hunted and desperate to find someone who could heal Arcann, Senya turned to a group of rogue Knights of Zakuul who had broken away from the Eternal Throne. But on arriving at their secret camp on Ord Mantell, she found the knights brutally slaughtered and her bloodthirsty daughter waiting for her.

Despite Vaylin's trap, Senya escaped Ord Mantell with her life... though the same could not be said of her former comrades-in-arms. Since the Ord Mantell massacre, more rumors of Senya and Arcann's location have surfaced, but none have proved substantial.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="936081" version="1065353216">The Eternal Empire of Zakuul's emergence had grave consequences for the Sith Empire. Darth Marr's execution left the Sith leaderless as the armies of Zakuul ravaged their worlds. Most of the remaining Dark Council were slain or went into hiding, and the once proud Sith Empire was forced into a humiliating surrender. 

As the new Sith Empress, Darth Acina swore fealty to the Eternal Throne. Under her rule, the Sith were allowed to maintain authority over most of the planets they had conquered, though each world paid a substantial monthly tribute to Zakuul.

Severe restrictions were also placed on the Sith military, with strict quotas imposed on the number of ships and troops allowed to remain in active service. However, there are rumors the Sith secretly--and rapidly--rebuilt their military since Vaylin came to power in anticipation of a renewed bid for independence.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="936082" version="1065353216">The lightning spires of Dromund Kaas tower above the planet's dark jungles, attracting the deadly lightning strikes that constantly scorch the world's storm-ravaged surface. The spires protect ground forces from falling prey to deadly strikes and harness the storm's electrical energy to power Kaas City.

The lightning spires were originally conceived by Renigus Wight, a former commander in the Imperial Reclamation Service. Renigus was spearheading an excavation mission in the jungles of Dromund Kaas when a violent storm erupted in the skies overhead. His officers ran for shelter, but were too slow. A single bolt of lightning wiped out his entire crew: 49 officers, researchers and slaves. Renigus only survived thanks to the grace of a twisted ankle that caused him to lag behind the panicked stampede and miss the fatal strike.

Following this incident, Renigus retired from the service to design the first lightning spire-a beacon of safety to shield future Imperial expeditions from the planet's wrathful storms.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="936083" version="1065353216">Developed by Arkanian researchers seeking an alternate energy source, a quantum bomb shreds the connections of elementary particles at a subatomic level, causing an escalating chain reaction that obliterates any matter it comes into contact with. The blast radius is subject to the random variances of quantum probability and can extend anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 kilometers.

Because of this unpredictability, quantum bombs are rarely used in military campaigns. Koth witnessed such destruction firsthand during the military campaign to conquer the Republic world of Denon. The devastation unleashed on the Denon fleet--followed by an order to open fire on civilians--caused him to abdicate his military command and turn his back on Zakuul.

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Koth recognized the potential of a quantum bomb beyond conventional military uses. By installing one on the Gravestone and integrating the trigger mechanism with the ship's systems, he concocted the ultimate fail-safe to keep the vessel from falling into enemy hands.</text>

Through brutal experiments and mental conditioning, Vaylin was subconsciously trained to respond to a specific phrase: kneel before the Dragon of Zakuul. When spoken by her father, these words prevent Vaylin from unleashing her power and temporarily trap her will in an unbreakable mental prison.

While effective, it is likely the conditioning aggravated Vaylin's violent tendencies and contributed to her mental instability. While trying to cage his daughter's anger, Valkorion transformed her into a monster.</text>

Deployment of new designs on test environment JX967A24 were within acceptable parameters. Our three initial dropship waves suffered heavy losses before planetfall. Test subject resistance was unexpectedly heavy, conflicting with prior scout reports indicating minimal military forces. The subjects deployed single-pilot aerial countermeasures to intercept us, but that self-sacrifice appears to be the full extent of their response.

Total time to planetwide surrender was 28 standard hours. Our master designer should be honored for this significant improvement over the last three test environments. Survivors received our standard compensation package, but damage to their civilization's infrastructure is extensive. Analysts estimate it will be at least 2,000 years before we can test this world again. Our scouts are already searching nearby systems for fresh prospects.

Per the master designer's request, our analysts have compiled a detailed study to explain the total failure on test environment Z17AX558. The details of their findings are available in a separate report, but in summary: the test environment's proximity to its star, coupled with previously-undetected trace chemicals in the upper atmosphere, reacted negatively to our new particle beams. The resulting electrochemical chain reaction ignited the entire biome, destroying the test subjects and our deployed designs within moments of activation.

While this can only be considered an unmitigated disaster from a return-on-investment perspective, we will make the most of our losses. The master designer's teams will recalibrate their particle beams to a lower-yield setting. Should we locate another planet like this, we can re-test our creation and hope for more satisfactory results.

Millennia of internal research and development have finally produced a fully-integrated and optimized planetary assault platform suitable to any environment or resistance pattern. On a personal note, it has been my sincere pleasure to work with the greatest master designer in our long history.

I must add one small addendum to this report for the sake of completeness. Analysts examining the test environment have discovered a vast underground vault constructed by the now-extinct natives. With no surviving test subjects to explain its function, we can only theorize why the structure was filled with cultural artifacts of little practical value. We will leave the vault to be discovered by whatever life emerges on the test environment in future epochs. Perhaps they will be able to explain their predecessors when we return to test them.

Greetings to all analysts, engineers, designers, and builders! It is with great pride that we mark this day as the official start of our civilization's greatest effort. Construction has commenced on Project Iokath. Where we once remade other worlds, we now devote ourselves to creating one. Our ambition is simple: fabricate an expandable and adaptable home for our people that is secure against any outside force. At long last, our culture will achieve the immortality it deserves.

We will call this new world Iokath, and our great-grandchildren will know it as their birthright.</text>

Today was another painful reminder of how meaningless the role of master designer has become. My days are wasted in endless planning meetings to direct the construction of new biomes for Iokath's endlessly-breeding populace. I only feel alive in my spare hours, when I revisit the great designs of ages past and vainly attempt to improve them.

The analysts who witnessed my gallery cooed and tutted, deeming it &quot;exceptional&quot; and &quot;a celebration of the thinking that made us great.&quot; What blind sycophancy. All I offered them were ornamental improvements. What difference does it make if SCORPIO looks like a floating cube, a ball of programmatic light, or a walking biped crafted in the image of a long-dead alien species?

We have fallen so far from our glory days. We no longer bother to deploy our designs on test environments and instead rely on simulations to predict the outcomes. Foolishness. Only the chaos of an unpredictable environment and its unique subjects can teach us anything.

I wonder what would happen if I deployed our designs on Iokath? Would I reveal something new?

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="936090" version="1065353216">In many technologically advanced societies, droids are designed to handle a multitude of mundane tasks. The organics who created Iokath embraced this idea, and built a wide variety of mechanical servants to nurture their artificial world. Custodian and compactor droids were created to preserve the parklands; scour swarm droids to clean the Chromium Garden; purifier droids to provide protection and security; and support droids to maintain and repair the entire system.

With the extinction of their organic masters, the purpose of these self-perpetuating service droids slowly changed. As newer generations evolved, their original mandates shifted from preservation of Iokath to aggression toward any foreign entity. 

The escalating xenophobia led to virtually every droid on Iokath becoming weaponized in some way, eventually culminating in the creation of the Colossus Droid, a war machine with enough firepower to wipe out an entire army.</text>

According to Raz--the short-tempered Duros band leader--their talents were wasted playing backup to underworld deals and barroom brawls. Raz and the Ubo-Kings were ahead of their time, a band of musical pioneers seemingly destined to never achieve stardom.

But everything changed when the Eternal Empire conquered the Core Worlds. Through unknown means, holos of the band's performances made their way to Zakuul--where they were soon played on street corners and in underground dance venues. Raz and the Ubo-Kings became an overnight sensation. Within a few months, their intoxicating music was played and sampled in every club on the Spire. 

Unfortunately, Raz and the Ubo-kings were still stuck on Nar Shaddaa and didn't collect a single credit from their explosive success on Zakuul. Hungry for fame and fortune, Raz prepped his band for a tour to the Eternal Empire's capital, but their plans were derailed when Empress Vaylin took power and forbid any offworld music from polluting her mighty empire.</text>

Believed to contain dark relics of incredible power, the vaults are a mythic prize few speak of openly and fewer still try to locate.

The last known hunt for these vaults was conducted by SIS Colonel Jen Alkier shortly after the Emperor disappeared from Dromund Kaas. Acting on a tip from a highly placed Sith informant, Alkier searched the fringes of Wild Space. After several weeks, all contact from the colonel ceased.

Months later, Alkier's abandoned ship was found on Korriban with no visible damage other than a wiped memory core and a missing astromech droid. The SIS tried to locate its missing agent, but Alkier's file was ultimately closed. The secrets of the Emperor's vaults remain a mystery.</text>

But the monotony of coordinating smuggling operations and continuous supply runs on behalf of the Alliance took its toll. Secretly, Hylo pined for the lost days of her infamous past: excitement, adventure, and glory. She became bored and restless... until she was given command of the Gravestone. 

Picking up where Koth Vortena--the previous captain--left off, she learned to pilot the vessel and delved into the ship's inner workings. To her delight, she discovered a technological marvel of ancient alien origins unlike anything she'd ever seen. Hylo became obsessed with unlocking the ship's full potential--a challenge worthy of her attention that ensured her continued dedication to the Outlander's cause.</text>

Using blueprints and data files of the Gravestone's original creators recovered from Iokath, the Alliance saw the opportunity to optimize the ship's weapons and defense systems. 

Unfortunately, installing the new upgrades has proved far more complicated than anticipated, leaving the Gravestone trapped in dry-dock while mechanics work frantically around the clock to integrate the new enhancements. While some argue it is foolish to sideline one of the most powerful ships in the galaxy for any length of time, the benefits seem to outweigh the risk. Once completed, the greater firepower, better shielding, and improved speed and maneuverability will make the Gravestone virtually unstoppable.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="936096" version="1065353216">In an era of planetary shields, the easiest way to conquer a world is to put boots on the ground. But even the largest army of surface troops can be neutralized by hostile or impassable terrain, which is why the Eternal Empire developed the world thrasher.

A massive armored vehicle, world thrashers are sent to clear a path for incoming ground troops during the first wave of a planetary invasion. These automated machines of environmental destruction can uproot or incinerate trees, smash boulders, flatten hills, and even burrow through mountains, earning them the nickname &quot;death tractors.&quot;

Attempts to utilize world thrashers as weapons have failed because their bulk makes them too ponderous and slow to effectively keep up with a military advance. However, any enemy soldiers careless enough to approach the death tractors will inevitably suffer heavy casualties.</text>

The crystal lattice can store vast amounts of information, as well as replicate the appearance and personality of the holocron's creator as a gatekeeper who will guide students in their training.

In his youth, Valkorion--then known as Tenebrae--discovered a way to twist and pervert the lattice so it could capture the spirit of powerful Force users, locking them in a metaphysical cage. He used the weapon on Dramath, his tyrannical father, and trapped him inside the holocron for centuries. 

But the same corrupted technology Valkorion used to vanquish his father could also be turned against him, permanently imprisoning his immortal spirit... or obliterating it from existence.</text>

For centuries upon centuries, he shaped and manipulated galactic events, bending the arc of history to his will during his obsessive quest for immortality. A being of unfathomable power and insatiable appetite, he transcended death multiple times, shedding his physical shells as they were discovered, defeated, and destroyed... only to return in another form.

With each rebirth, he grew stronger. His machinations became grander. The pain and suffering he unleashed became greater. Some believed his ultimate goal was conquest: the complete subjugation of every world, known and unknown. Others believed he sought annihilation: the consumption of every living being in the galaxy, until he alone remained.

Yet, immortality is an impossibility. No matter how strong, how powerful, how godlike, all must perish. In the end, Valkorion could not escape the inevitable, permanent end to his existence. Finally, after thousands of years, the Immortal Emperor--his body, his spirit, the very essence of his being--is no more.</text>

The dark side cataclysm obliterated the Voreclaw's hive mind, transforming their underground colonies into mindless individuals without purpose or will.

Driven by hunger, the voreclaw emerged onto Nathema's barren surface, where the sun's radiation seared their exposed flesh and charred their chitinous shells. With no other plants or animals to eat, the voreclaw resorted to cannibalism-- devouring each other until only the few strongest remained.

The species was saved from extinction when the Sith Emperor captured the few survivors to use as guardians in his underground vault. Frozen in carbonite, the voreclaw remained in suspended animation for generations--grim sentries waiting to be awakened should anyone be foolish enough to enter their new domain.</text>

- Anti-Alliance hatred fueled by manufactured propaganda.
- Funding by several front companies originating in the Outer Rim.
- Connections to various deceased persons of note. 
- Transmissions via a unique encrypted algorithm. 
- Presence and usage of rare cybernetic implants at each uprising site.

This evidence directly connects the uprisings to a single conspirator. Their motives remain unknown, but they likely acted to destabilize galactic peace and weaken the Eternal Alliance. The scope and breadth of such a conspiracy speaks to an individual or group with substantial funding and expertise in the art of subterfuge and manipulation.

Alliance agents are currently investigating all possible perpetrators, including Sith Intelligence, the Republic SIS, and the Star Cabal.

The RS-33 adrenal and its progenitor, the RAK-5 serum, have been contained and the research destroyed. Doctor Semhess's dangerous project is no longer a threat. Investigations into the project's origins and principal contributors are now underway.

One notable early discovery relates to Doctor Rahser Poth, the expert who supposedly developed the RAK-5 serum. We've learned that his research was aided by an anonymous scientist. Their communications were encrypted, but we're piecing together what we've been able to recover--and it appears that this unknown scientist fed Doctor Poth the majority of the information that led to the RAK-5 breakthrough. Efforts to ID this scientist have turned up no results so far.

Also of note is funding for the project, which was falsely obtained through a Republic endowment for disease research and treatment development. A staggering amount of data was altered to facilitate this, requiring slicing skills that no one among Semhess's staff seem to have possessed. Agents will continue analyzing the falsified data to find clues as to its origin and thus identify the additional conspirator(s).</text>

With General Rike's forces defeated, the baradium mines of Denova are now under Alliance control; an odd twist of fate, given that we had no plans to claim the mines until Rike seized them to use against us. Although our forces can certainly make use of the explosive material, holding and defending the mines from here on will be an appreciable (if manageable) drain on Alliance resources overall. 

Rike had a history of exceeding orders in order to fulfill what he viewed as his duty to the Republic, so this action is hardly out of character. That he was able to move such a large force into position without challenge suggests strongly that there are further anti-Alliance conspirators within the Republic military; our agents are sifting through Rike's datafiles now to identify as many suspects as possible.

Investigations into the origins of Commander Kallin's plot are ongoing. After tracing the source of the explosives, we have ruled out that they were stolen from evidence lockups or purchased from any local criminal groups. Kallin's connections to former Chancellor Saresh are well documented, so it seems likely that he may have acquired the explosives through a mutual underworld contact.

The slicing expertise necessary to gather so many combat droids is another point of concern. The methodology employed seems to match SIS techniques; these skills may have been acquired from another mutual contact with Saresh, though she was never particularly popular within that agency.

Regardless, perhaps the most troubling aspect of the situation was its complexity and sophistication. Kallin has never been noted as a particularly surreptitious individual, preferring brute force tactics in most of his recorded operations. His psychological profile does not seem to match a false flag operation of this kind.</text>

Status: Terminated (full autopsy pending)

Doctor Oggurobb's investigations are ongoing, but initial findings revealed that the Gethul entity contained genetic markers from dozens of species, including dianoga, rathtars, and surprisingly, Rakata. This is particularly interesting as certain particulate matter found deep within the entity's digestive tract is found only on the planet Belsavis, suggesting that the creature originated there and was at some point moved to Makeb, perhaps by the same Rakatans who constructed the Belsavis containment facilities.

The entity's mental connection to Adelade and its sway over other biological creatures suggests some degree of Force sensitivity, further deepening the mystery of its origins and life cycle. Is this creature representative of an undiscovered species, or merely a unique creation of ancient Rakatan scientists? While we search for answers, one troubling mystery remains.

Adelade found the entity based on intel she received from an unidentified third party. This source sent her precise coordinates--and the claim that she would discover one of the Force's greatest mysteries buried beneath Makeb. Who sent her this intel? If it was a friend, why cover their tracks? If an enemy, what did they hope to accomplish by luring Adelade into the heart of madness? We will continue to investigate.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="949665" version="1065353216">Subject: Commander Tassar
Status: Terminated

Battalion Commander Tassar was the foremost architect of the Star Fortress program, employing her combination of scientific genius and strategic expertise in subjugating the larger portion of the Core Worlds for nearly half a decade. Of course, as our Alliance has proven, even the most brilliant designs can be compromised, and Tassar's esteem among the Zakuulan elite fell along with her battle stations.

Tassar chose exile rather than face the direct judgment of her Eternal Empress, and was joined by her most loyal troops. A cult of personality formed around her, with her followers becoming increasingly zealous in their beliefs that Tassar was the one true hope for Zakuul's future. It's unclear if Tassar herself shared in this belief or merely exploited it to continue the work that had become her sole fixation: shoring up her Star Fortress designs to be completely indestructible. If her work had been completed, the integration of Rakatan self-repairing technology would have made Tassar's new Star Fortress truly formidable.

Most of Tassar's data was destroyed, but our agents did discover one point of interest: Tassar's discovery of Rakata Prime and its technologies appears to have resulted from the interception of one of our own transports, which was carrying samples to Doctor Oggurobb for study. Investigation of that incident will be expanded immediately.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="951982" version="1065353216">The Six Gods</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="951982" version="1065353216">Little is known about the six titan droids that lie in hibernation on Iokath. These superweapons were created millennia ago by the planet's architects, likely designed to pacify, subjugate, and destroy entire civilizations. Salvaged records indicate these machines operate as a sentient family unit of &quot;god kin.&quot; They are:

TYTH, God of Rage.
AIVELA, Goddess of Passion.
ESNE, Goddess of Envy.
NAHUT, God of Apathy.
SCYVA, Goddess of Sorrow.
IZAX, God of Death.

During early weapon testing, Iokath unleashed the Six Gods on various unsuspecting planets. Trillions of lives were lost. The people of Zakuul were among the targeted victims, and the survivors eventually mythologized their would-be destroyers as a pantheon of merciless gods. Centuries later, these machine gods are still worshipped on Zakuul.

When civil war broke out on Iokath, one faction did the unthinkable and turned the Six Gods against their rival brethren. The resulting cataclysm wiped out all life on the planet and exterminated the Iokath species. These titans were their greatest achievement--and the engines of their ultimate destruction. Now, after a millennia-long slumber, the droids are about to reawaken.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="951983" version="1065353216">Iokath Remotes</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="951983" version="1065353216">The strange remotes are one of Iokath's many mysteries. These technological obelisks have been spotted across the world, hovering just above the ground via unseen propulsion systems and scanning their surroundings with omnidirectional lenses. Some remotes are mobile, while others hang in stationary orbit around the planet's various technoliths. They are outfitted for observation over combat, though they possess the unique ability to interface with Iokath's advanced technology.

Doctor Oggurobb believes the remotes were built centuries ago as multi-purpose drones used to construct the massive planetary structure of Iokath. More recently, the AI known as ARIES likely repurposed them to monitor any trespassers stranded on the planet. Oggurobb has attempted to dismantle several damaged remote husks recovered from Iokath--to disastrous effect. Latent safeguards buried in the remotes sent electric shocks through eight of Oggurobb's assistant researchers, singing eyebrows and temporarily blinding two scientists. At this rate, the true function of the Iokath remotes may forever remain a mystery.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="951984" version="1065353216">Pneumatic Trams</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="951984" version="1065353216">The pneumatic trams of Iokath cross every kilometer of the planetary megastructure in a complex network of tubes that doubles as a transportation system and cooling matrix for the technological world. The trams were initially built as an energy-efficient method of moving construction supplies to the far corners of the planet. Propelled by pressurized gas, these materials were transported across entire continents, speeding up Iokath's creation tenfold.

For centuries, the trams operated without incident--until an act of sabotage ignited the pressurized gas and sparked a catastrophic explosion that killed thousands and leveled a nearby settlement. This attack sparked the Iokath Civil War, a centuries-long conflict that ended with the extinction of every organic species on the planet. When the dust settled, Iokath's droid caretakers fixed the tram and used it to help repair the damage wrought by their deceased creators.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="952315" version="1065353216">Theron was born from the love affair between two Republic heroes: Jedi Knight Satele Shan and Republic Captain Jace Malcom. Their romance was short-lived, and Satele only discovered her pregnancy after the two parted ways. She kept the child a secret and gave birth in hiding. Though Satele wanted nothing more than to care for her newborn son, she had to uphold her duty to the Jedi Order. She surrendered Theron to the care of her Jedi Master--Ngani Zho--to continue serving the Republic.

Theron was briefly raised as a Jedi, but the older he grew, the more obvious it became that he was not Force-sensitive. He ultimately left the Jedi Order and joined the Republic Strategic Information Service. Theron excelled in his covert work as a spy, and finally met Jace Malcom and learned that he was his father. They worked together on Operation End Game and parted on good terms. In the following years, they shared the occasional father-son meeting, but struggled to grow close. Though the meetings were awkward, Theron always felt a fondness for his father--a feeling he never had for his mother, who he felt abandoned him for the good of the Republic.

Theron's relationship with Malcom reached a breaking point when he left the Republic to help found the Alliance. Malcom saw this as a betrayal, but Theron refused to bow to the Eternal Empire's oppressive army. Harsh words were exchanged during their last holocall several years ago. They haven't spoken since.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="952317" version="1065353216">Jace Malcom</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="952317" version="1065353216">Jace Malcom--Acting Supreme Commander of the Republic Military, celebrated Republic war hero and one-time leader of Havoc Squad--has spent most of his life locked in battle with the Sith Empire. His forces respect his calm leadership, and he offers the same respect in return, regardless of rank or position. Among his many legendary victories, his earliest defining success was his clash with Darth Malgus during the Battle of Alderaan. With help from Havoc Squad and Jedi Knight Satele Shan, Malcom ambushed the invading Imperial army and successfully forced Darth Malgus to retreat. Malcom still wears scars from that battle as a proud reminder that one must be willing to sacrifice everything to defeat the enemies of peace and justice.

Details of his brief romance with Shan are a closely-guarded secret. Their relationship began on the battlefield and continued behind closed doors as the soldier and Jedi found trust and love in each other's company. Their love affair ended shortly after it began, but not before they sired a son: Theron Shan. Satele hid Theron's existence, and Malcom only met his lost son many years later.

Malcom later served as the Supreme Commander of the Republic Military. When the Eternal Empire rose as a major galactic threat, he pushed for open defiance, but his hands were tied by a corrupt chancellor and a browbeaten senate. He finally found support after Coruscant was nearly destroyed by the Eternal Empire. As the Republic rebuilt, Malcom used his newfound political clout to raise an army and prepare for the coming war. Under his watch, the Republic would stop at nothing to reclaim its lost glory and restore peace to the galaxy.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="952464" version="1065353216">With the fall of the Eternal Empire, millions of Zakuulan armed forces were cast adrift, without a leader to command them or an empire to defend. Senya Tirall approached her former comrades in the Knights of Zakuul and convinced a contingent of the Force-sensitive warriors to join the newly forged Eternal Alliance. Meanwhile, Doctor Oggurobb tackled the Skytrooper problem. Under his supervision, Alliance engineers reprogrammed the Overwatch control center on Zakuul and converted the Skytrooper battle droids into loyal Alliance soldiers.

Tensions spiked as the Zakuulan forces flooded the Eternal Alliance ranks. Some feared being displaced by the new recruits, while others couldn't trust their former enemies. The xenophobic Alliance Captain Hym Jemuro even imprisoned the Skytroopers stationed aboard his capital ship in the cargo hold, claiming they were plotting a mutiny. Two days later, his ship suffered catastrophic damage while navigating the Kauron asteroid field. The Skytroopers escaped the cargo hold, repaired the ship's critical systems, and saved the crew. Since then, the Alliance has largely embraced their former enemies, much to the frustration of the disgraced Captain Jemuro.</text>

Most notable is Umbara's research into technological uses for Adegan crystals.

Though offworlders have no issue breathing the planet's dense atmosphere, native Umbarans' delicate systems require special helmets in order to breathe. Preferring solitude and secrecy, Umbarans rarely leave their dark homeworld, opting to isolate themselves from the rest of Republic space.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="957641" version="1065353216">Even before the Eternal Empire's reign, the war between the Republic and Sith Empire created a constant strain on resources. Vital raw materials from planets on both sides were often shipped to the military for use in the war, creating scarcity on Republic and Imperial worlds.

When both factions fell to the Eternal Empire, what little raw materials and supplies they'd managed to save were forfeited to the Eternal Fleet. Conquered worlds suffered a major resource crisis and resorted to heavy rationing. In extreme cases, like Tatooine, civilian vehicles were confiscated for scrap, and residents were limited to a single government-issued ration bar per day.

After the Eternal Empire's defeat, many hoped for an improvement in the availability of resources. However, what little the newly freed planets had left was needed to repair the damage caused by the devastating war. Those hit hardest by the Eternal Fleet, such as Voss, struggled to survive amidst the wreckage of their crops and manufacturing facilities. For both the Empire and Republic, hope lies in what little they can secure from neutral worlds discovered during the war.</text>

Rather than see their society crumble in the face of tyranny, the Chiss decided to strike a deal: they would freely give their two richest industrial worlds to Arcann as tribute. In return, the Eternal Empire would allow the Ascendancy to retain their homeworlds.

This deal let the Chiss remain largely untouched by the war. After the Alliance's victory, the Ascendancy easily claimed their lost worlds with the Sith Empire's help. Though the Chiss claim to be suffering a resource crisis like the rest of the galaxy, rumors circulate about secret stores they've kept hidden from the Sith.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="959947" version="1065353216">Though incredibly rare, the Chiss have produced Force-sensitives among their people. There's a strong stigma against Force-sensitives among the Chiss because many believe it's an impurity or faulty genetics, and must be purged. Most Force-sensitive Chiss work hard to hide their shameful abilities.

When a Force-sensitive is discovered in the Ascendancy, the consequences depend on the individual's social standing and family lineage. A lower-class Chiss is exiled from the Ascendancy, while a social elite may be allowed to use a combination of surgery and medication to keep their powers dormant. Any Chiss caught practicing or weaponizing the Force within Ascendancy territory is executed without question.

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="959948" version="1065353216">As the Aristocra of House Miurani, Saganu served as a commander in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force and occasionally performed diplomatic duties for the Ascendancy. During the war, Saganu and his troops were stationed on Hoth to help the Sith Empire seize the planet from the Republic. Though it was scrubbed from official records, rumors indicate he also provided support for Imperial Intelligence before its disbandment.

During the Eternal Empire's attack on known space, it was Saganu who brokered the deal between Arcann and the Ascendancy. His cool-headed negotiation tactics allowed the Chiss to retain the majority of their worlds in return for abundant production resources for the Eternal Fleet. This deal earned him a promotion to supreme commander of the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force, where he oversees all Chiss military campaigns.</text>

After the Eternal Empire's invasion, the station's staff was relocated and never replaced, and the station itself was forgotten, a victim of the secrecy that once protected it--there was no one left who knew that it needed to be staffed in the first place.

Sensors have detected energy signatures from the station's equipment that do not match any known Imperial technology, likely the result of modifications made by the station's mysterious new occupants. The original source, purpose, and capabilities of these modifications are unknown.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="972017" version="1065353216">The few surviving Zealots who once served Valkorion in his Nathema stronghold now eke out a bleak existence in the planet's abandoned wilds, where they live in fragmented tribes.

Although each and every one of the Zealots felt Valkorion's death vividly through the Force, all of them refuse to believe that it has actually occurred. Wild and improbable theories about his current state of existence and how best to continue serving him have driven the Zealots into forming rival, warring groups who raid and kill one another interminably.

Ironically, all of the Zealots still alive owe their survival to their master's death and the subsequent blooming of life on the planet's once-barren surface; otherwise, they would all have starved long ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="972018" version="1065353216">Nathema Reborn</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="972018" version="1065353216">The ecological revitalization of Nathema has been nothing short of miraculous. Vibrant plant life has not only taken root but flourished, dramatically altering the planet's once-desolate landscape.

Force-users no longer experience the unsettling &quot;wrongness&quot; that they once felt whenever setting foot on the planet. The air has become fresher, and the weather more dynamic.

That this has all occurred since the death of Valkorion cannot be a coincidence, though experts cannot agree on any precise environmental mechanism that could have brought about such an abrupt change.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="972019" version="1065353216">The Order of Zildrog</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="972019" version="1065353216">Formed by Vinn Atrius, the Order of Zildrog is highly secretive, militantly organized, and ruthlessly dedicated to a single purpose: the death of the Outlander who now commands the Eternal Alliance.

The group's membership is mostly made up of Zakuulan hardliners like Atrius who blame the Outlander for destroying the civilization that Valkorion built for them. Their numbers include Knights and soldiers from the Zakuulan military, cultists from fringe groups like the Heralds of Zildrog, and even a handful of individuals from the Core Worlds with personal vendettas of their own.

Unified by their singular hatred and the countless lives they've seen ruined in the Outlander's wake, the Order will stop at nothing to complete their mission of vengeance.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="972020" version="1065353216">Zildrog</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="972020" version="1065353216">The ancient mechanical entity known as Zildrog has always operated from behind the scenes. Unlike the other &quot;machine gods&quot; of Iokath, Zildrog permanently functions in two forms.

The first is a central computer that specializes in the transfer of life energies. Given this device's presence on Nathema, it is likely that Zildrog was a key element of the original ritual Tenebrae used to empower himself at the cost of all life on the planet. Beyond that first atrocity, however, Zildrog's central mind appears to have played no role in Tenebrae's dual life as Vitiate and Valkorion, and slumbered in stasis mode until Vinn Atrius discovered it many years later.

The second of Zildrog's forms is the ancient warship known as the Gravestone. Though it can be operated by an organic crew when required, the vessel's Dark Heart functions as a remote command core that allows Zildrog to control the ship as an extension of itself.  

Ancient Zakuulan myths often confuse or conflate Zildrog and Izax, likely because both entities are aerial platforms employing omnicannon technology. Given the many differences in their construction and operation, it seems likely that they were actually built entirely separately--perhaps even as rival projects carried out in Iokath's endless pursuit of better and deadlier weapons.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="972021" version="1065353216">News of the near-total destruction of the Eternal Alliance fleet has spread quickly, leading to renewed fears of a reignited war between the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire. Both factions have reportedly redoubled their efforts to hoard supplies, munitions, and fuel in anticipation of renewed hostilities. Resource shortages, already a common occurrence on many core worlds, are becoming a daily reality across the galaxy at large.

With no single unifying threat to motivate their continued cooperation, these tensions have led many of the Alliance's forces to return to their original sides of the age-old conflict, rejoining their longtime allies and waiting with grim certainty for the war to begin anew.

A hardened force of dedicated troops and staff still maintains the Alliance base on Odessen, however, and a small fleet still patrols Wild Space on their behalf. The Commander's closest allies remain loyal to the leader who helped unite them during one of the galaxy's darkest times--whatever path the Commander chooses next, they will most certainly follow, potentially tipping the scales of any conflict....</text>

Debate had been raging in the Republic over the issue of droid rights: Did droids deserve the same treatment as organic beings, and was owning droids tantamount to slavery? This question was rendered moot when a Czerka-built assassin droid, HK-01, went rogue and began reprogramming other droids to rise up against their masters, in what would be called the Great Droid Revolution.

Republic citizens, surrounded by thousands of rogue droids--every model, from protocol to sanitation to battle units--found themselves at the mercy of their former servants. Several planets were subjugated in the name of the droid rebellion, until the signal controlling the droids was traced. 

Following the signal, a team of Jedi destroyed HK-01, returning the rogue droids to their original programming. The relieved Republic returned to normal, and the issue of droid rights was not raised again.</text>

At the time of the Cron Supernova, the Great Jedi Library of Ossus was overseen by Ood Bnar, a Jedi Master specializing in knowledge of the Sith and their use of the dark side. Though his tenure as head librarian was short, Ood Bnar served loyally, defending the library's artifacts from the Sith Lord Exar Kun in the final moments before the supernova razed the planet.

As a member of the tree-like Neti species, Ood Bnar could alter his physiology and shape, allowing him to transform from a humanoid into a towering tree in order to envelop and protect a cache of ancient lightsabers. He entered a form of deep hibernation as the Cron Supernova struck and has yet to rouse from this trance-like state. Master Gnost-Dural and many other Jedi have meditated at his roots, hoping to communicate and learn from the ancient Jedi, but thus far, Ood Bnar has offered no response.</text>

Ossus still bears the scars of the Cron Supernova: its surface is a seared wasteland of rock and sand. But even this degree of desolation is shockingly mild; that the planet was not rendered into a charred ball of molten rock, or even obliterated completely, is nothing short of miraculous.

Little academic work has been put forward to explain this unlikely survival; only conjecture. The initial cause of the supernova was unnatural; perhaps this explains the unnatural results? Ossus was a stronghold of the Jedi; does the inherent life force of such a place make it more resistant to destruction? Could the unique astrophysical structure of the Adega system where Ossus is found have played a role? 

Regardless of the reasons, the continued survival of Ossus offers the promise that its ancient mysteries may one day be unlocked.</text>

Of his many accomplishments, perhaps the most influential of Odan-Urr's works was his revised version of the Jedi Code, which he created in response to the struggles of his pupils to fully understand and embrace what it meant to be a Jedi. Odan-Urr's revised wording of the code became the definitive version, taught and recited by Jedi ever since.</text>

Master Arca Jeth and his students sought to cleanse Onderon of Nadd's influence by moving Nadd's sarcophagus to Onderon's moon, Dxun, but they were ambushed by Naddists who stole the sarcophagus. 

While seeking out the Naddists, Arca Jeth discovered that King Ommin, long thought dead, was being kept alive in a secret facility. Also a follower of Nadd, Ommin joined forces with Nadd's undying spirit and managed to capture Arca Jeth. The king fled to a secret stronghold while Arca Jeth's student, Ulic Qel-Droma, called for Republic reinforcements.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="977353" version="1065353216">Devastated by the Sith centuries ago, the planet Ossus has largely been forgotten by the greater galaxy. Enshrouded in the nebular material of the Cron Drift, the planet is difficult to even reach, with those who survive the journey discovering only hazardous wastelands and abandoned ruins on its surface.

Though it was once a notable center of Jedi culture and learning, the planet has rarely been visited by members of the Jedi Order in recent decades, as Ossus is located well within the Sith Empire's sphere of influence. For their part, the Sith have shown no interest whatsoever in exploring the planet; what purpose could be served by visiting the charred grave of an already-defeated foe?</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="979211" version="1065353216">On Ilum, war brought ruination to a sacred Jedi world--and to my own life as a member of their order.

Stranded in the aftermath of their downfall, my only path forward was among the planet's scofflaw denizens. As a member of the Corellian Run Scoundrels, I continued my path ever onward.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="979278" version="1065353216">Mysterious. Intriguing. Captivating. These are only a few of the descriptors applied to the individual known only as Don the Exiled Knight. In the short time since the publisher of his forthcoming autobiography first introduced him to the galactic stage, Don has become a HoloNet sensation, driving speculation and curiosity from literary fans across the galaxy.

Where does he come from? Why was he exiled from the Jedi? Where will his wanderings take him next? An audience hungry to learn the full facts about this unusual individual has sprung up seemingly overnight, driving an unprecedented search by journalists and investigators hoping to be the first to find Don and learn the truth from the Exiled Knight himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="980970" version="1065353216">Survivors of the Cron Supernova</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="980970" version="1065353216">Though it would seem impossible, sparse evidence exists suggesting that there were survivors of the Cron supernova that devastated the surface of Ossus. Colonists have reported missing personal items, strange noises, and mysterious footprints, particularly in areas deep within surviving ruins; quite reasonable, considering that no one who was on the planet's surface could have survived such a cataclysm.
Unfortunately, any survivors who may exist seem determined to remain unseen and undiscovered. With the present crisis, it is unlikely that a more detailed search will be conducted at any point in the near future; the truth of the survivors of Ossus will thus be left to future generations to discover.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984047" version="1065353216">A seasoned Jedi, Tau Idair spent years engaged in front-line combat against both the Sith Empire and Zakuul. She has a natural aptitude for lightsaber fighting techniques, as well as the mechanics of the weapon itself; her personal lightsaber has seen enough tinkering and modification to rival any hot-rodded swoop or smuggler's freighter.

Tau was recruited to join the Jedi colony on Ossus by Master Gnost-Dural himself; the two of them were among the only survivors of a lengthy campaign fought in the rugged swamps of the planet Mimban. Although he was not her original master, Gnost-Dural has become a close friend and mentor to Tau, and the two of them make a formidable team in even the most dire circumstances.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984049" version="1065353216">Darth Malora</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984049" version="1065353216">Darth Malora sits on the Dark Council of the Sith Empire, where she oversees the sphere of Scientific Advancement. Initially held back from opportunities by her first master, Lord Renning, Malora eventually managed to escape his &quot;mentorship&quot; and make a name for herself through her mastery of a combination of Sith alchemy and genetic engineering; in particular, a technique for regenerating damaged tissue and organs more quickly than even bacta or kolto.

By cautiously offering &quot;treatments&quot; to only the most powerful and influential Sith on Dromund Kaas, Malora rose to prominence and gained the resources necessary to advance her experimentation ever further. She has since made extensive modifications to her own body, the purposes of which she has revealed to no one.

When Darth Acina took the Imperial throne, she made scientific progress a priority, creating a pathway for Malora's work to gain notoriety and, eventually, for her rise to the Dark Council.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984056" version="1065353216">Master Gnost-Dural</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984056" version="1065353216">Jedi Master Gnost-Dural is most widely known as the order's chief historian; his extensive analyses have been pivotal in the Jedi Council's decision-making for many years, and his deep study of the actions and motives of influential Sith figures has led directly to numerous key victories against them. 

But the studious and patient Kel-Dor Jedi has not merely viewed the events of the galaxy from a safe distance; Gnost-Dural has played an active role in galactic events throughout his career, granting him a unique level of insight into the day-to-day realities of the people he documents.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984057" version="1065353216">Major Anri</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984057" version="1065353216">The advancement of non-humans in the ranks of the Sith Empire's military has been slow but steady since the reforms first put forth by Darth Malgus and continued by Darth Marr. It is now estimated that up to eight percent of the Imperial military is staffed by non-humans; among the highest-ranking of these is the Twi'lek ex-slave Anri, who serves as a major in command of a prestigious Special Forces unit: Raven Squad.

Anri views her advancement in the meritocratic terms of the Sith Empire at large; one's power and standing rises as they prove their superiority by overcoming the threats and impediments facing them. Her skillful leadership and gallows humor have made her popular with her fellow troops, and while her outspokenness has led some officers and Sith to question her dedication, her troops know firsthand that her determination to see the Sith Empire triumph over all foes is absolute.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984065" version="1065353216">The Reformed Dark Council</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984065" version="1065353216">After her rise to the throne of the Sith Empire, Empress Acina streamlined the structure of the Dark Council, reducing its size from twelve seats to five. Each of these Dark Councillors now oversee two to three of the spheres of power controlled by the original council.
The new seats on the Dark Council and the spheres they oversee are structured as follows:

Sith Doctrine
--Ancient Knowledge 
--Mysteries 
--Philosophy

Military Command
--Defense of the Empire 
--Military Offense 
--Military Strategy

Scientific Advancement
--Technology 
--Biotic Science

Civil Administration
--Production and Logistics 
--Laws and Justice

Galactic Influence
--Sith Intelligence

		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984067" version="1065353216">The Great Jedi Library of Ossus</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984067" version="1065353216">Constructed more than a thousand years in the past, the Great Jedi Library of Ossus long stood as a center of learning and knowledge in the Republic. Records suggest that the library once contained countless documents and data detailing civilizations, species, and events that history has now long forgotten. Recent Jedi excavations have rediscovered much of this material, though the true depths of the library's ruins remain unexplored and undocumented. 

Professional historians and academics often hold the destruction of the Great Library at the hands of the Sith as one of the greatest tragedies in civilized history. It is common for modern libraries throughout the Republic to feature commemorative placards in honor of their destroyed &quot;ancestor&quot;, promising to preserve and pass down knowledge freely and widely in order to avoid another such catastrophe.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984068" version="1065353216">Mutated Geonosians</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984068" version="1065353216">The newest of Darth Malora's creations, the mutant Geonosians deployed on Ossus are actually a hybridization of multiple species drawn from across the galaxy. Most of the original subjects were purchased as adult slaves or in egg or larval forms from a secretive group of Hutt gourmands who have no objections to devouring sentient species (when properly prepared).

Using a combination of genetic engineering and Sith alchemical techniques, Malora created Geonosian warriors with the thick armored carapaces of Acklays, the rapid reproduction of Killiks, and the heightened sensory capabilities of the Melitto. Only the barest amount of sentience remains--just enough to operate weapons such as blasters and vibroblades.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984069" version="1065353216">Krex</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984069" version="1065353216">The Krex are a hardy reptilian species with a knack for survival. Despite their fearsome appearance, the Krex are most widely known as explorers, pioneers, and colonists of hazardous and far-flung worlds, where their natural regenerative properties and tough skin are of great benefit. Still, it's not uncommon to find hardened Krex putting their abilities to work in other dangerous professions.

Interestingly, the Krex homeworld of Rokirex does not appear to be their actual planet of origin; the ancient mythology of the Krex refers to their ancestors exclusively as &quot;travelers&quot;, and no examples of similar species can be found anywhere in the Rokirex archaeological record. This has led some biologists to theorize that they are actually descendants of long-lost Chistori colonists who gradually developed into a distinct genetic line.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984070" version="1065353216">General Daeruun</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984070" version="1065353216">A staunch Republic loyalist, Ardinondu Dipolus Daeruun's hulking and fearsome appearance belie his studious nature and passion for the arts. Despite his natural physical strengths, Daeruun has no particular love for battle, and rarely even carries a blaster. He is tremendously fond of literature, poetry, theater, and the visual arts; his personal quarters are scattered with paintings and musical instruments he's dabbled with over the years. 

Daeruun's love of culture and the arts was the primary driver of his enlistment in the military and subsequent years of meritorious service. In his youth, Daeruun's family worked with Jedi Master Vij Markos to help resettle refugees from worlds conquered by the Empire, instilling him with a deep understanding of the cost of any Imperial victory.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984071" version="1065353216">Strike Base XR-484</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984071" version="1065353216">XR-484 acts as the staging point for all Imperial operations on the planet Ossus. It was constructed within a field of starship wreckage on the recommendation of the scouts who first reconnoitered the planet, who correctly assessed that the Jedi are more interested in exploring ancient structures than old crashed ships, ensuring the base could be established without drawing enemy attention.

The majority of the ship wreckage around XR-484 is the result of crashes caused by the Cron Supernova centuries ago. However, the remains of newer vessels are also present, suggesting that atmospheric or gravitational conditions somehow result in a higher-than-average distribution of crashed ships in this specific area.

Although the members of Raven Squad consistently refer to the base as &quot;the Nest&quot;, Darth Malora pointedly refuses to use the term.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984073" version="1065353216">The Hidden Jedi Colony on Ossus</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984073" version="1065353216">With the Jedi in tatters after years of war against the Sith and Zakuul, Master Gnost-Dural feared that the order was on the verge of total destruction. To preserve the Jedi and their teachings for the future, he secretly gathered the allies and resources necessary to establish a hidden colony on Ossus, hoping that the planet's obscurity and remoteness would provide ample protection.

The colony has flourished beyond even Gnost-Dural's greatest hopes; innovative environmental reclamation techniques have allowed farming and water purification on a planet that otherwise supported little if any life.

Perhaps the only major challenge the colony faced before the Sith invasion was the decision to remain out of communications. Although heavily debated by the colonists and Jedi alike, Gnost-Dural ultimately insisted that the colony remain as cut-off from the larger galaxy as possible, and it has remained in total isolation for years.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984077" version="1065353216">Twi'lek Pilgrims on Ossus</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984077" version="1065353216">Despite initial tensions around their settlement on Tython, many of the Twi'lek Pilgrims established long-lasting friendships with their Jedi neighbors over the subsequent years. In particular, Master Gnost-Dural's efforts to document the Pilgrims' struggles and the history of their settlement helped to create a stronger relationship between the two groups.

When he set out to create the Jedi colony on Ossus, Gnost-Dural was quick to reach out to the Pilgrims for their advice and aid, having come to admire their resilience and expertise. This led several of the Pilgrims to volunteer to join the project and share their years of colonizing experience, contributing much to the colony's success in the harsh conditions of Ossus.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="0" id2="984130" version="1065353216">Darth Malgus Lives</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1" id2="984130" version="1065353216">Having returned to the galactic stage as part of the Empire's assault on the Jedi colony of Ossus, Darth Malgus has become a topic of widespread debate and investigation once more--particularly his improbable survival after his attempted coup during the battle of Ilum. 

The most popular theory holds that agents of Darth Acina, then-head of the Sphere of Technology, retrieved Malgus and resuscitated him, transforming the cyborg Sith into her own secret enforcer. That she gained control of an agent as deadly as Malgus would explain much about her subsequent rise to the Imperial throne. Some now theorize that Acina may even have used Malgus to eliminate her rivals on the Dark Council during the confusion of the war against Zakuul, though this remains only conjecture.</text>
