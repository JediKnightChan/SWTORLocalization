Nico will not participate in the story prior to the point where he would naturally join you, but he will still accompany you on your adventures and will look great doing it.

(Unlocking Nico early will not prevent you from experiencing his recruitment mission when you reach its natural place in the story, he will simply become unavailable for a short while as you run the mission)&quot;</text>
