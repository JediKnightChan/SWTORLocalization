		<text bitflag="321" id1="1219332" id2="17" version="1065353216">For those who do not wish to wait to recruit Ranos naturally on their adventures (which will happen following KotFE Chapter 9 and completion of the Dark vs. Light Eternal tier), this device can be used to get Master Ranos's assistance early, and instantly unlock her as a companion.

Ranos will not participate in the story prior to the point where she would naturally join you, but she will still accompany you on your adventures and cut down your enemies with the powerful grace of a veteran Jedi Master.

(Unlocking Ranos early will not prevent you from experiencing her recruitment mission when you reach its natural place in the story; she will simply become unavailable for a short while as you run the mission.)</text>
