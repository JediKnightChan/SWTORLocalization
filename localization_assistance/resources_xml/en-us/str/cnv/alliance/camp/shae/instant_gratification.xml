		<text bitflag="321" id1="1219263" id2="17" version="1065353216">For those who do not wish to wait to recruit Shae naturally on their adventures (which will happen following KotFE Chapter 14), this device can be used to get Shae Vizla's assistance early, and instantly unlock her as a companion.

Shae will not participate in the story prior to the point where she would naturally join you, but she will still accompany you on your adventures and eliminate your enemies with the merciless skill befitting a Mandalorian warrior.

(Unlocking Shae early will not prevent you from experiencing her recruitment mission when you reach its natural place in the story; she will simply become unavailable for a short while as you run the mission.)</text>
