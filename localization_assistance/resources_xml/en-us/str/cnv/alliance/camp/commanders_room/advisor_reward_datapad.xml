I now find that you have already started upon some of the paths that I see in my visions. Your steps are exceptional, Commander. There is no doubt that you are the one who will lead this Alliance to victory.

We require support of body and mind. Artifacts and relics will teach us, as new recruits will broaden our eyes. You will be the one to bring this all together. My visions can guide you, but you must walk the path.

We'll continue to snatch up every last credit from the pockets of the Eternal Empire. If we find anything extra, I'll be sure to let you have your pick of the good stuff.

We're getting fresh faces and fences in here every day. Some of the boys are putting bets on what or who you'll cart in next. My coin's on a Drall with the skills to crack the best casinos on Corellia.

Looking forward to your next haul.

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1194324" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey Commander,

We need as many ears to the ground and eyes in the shadows as we can get if we're going to pull this off. There are some runners around that can carry their weight, sure--but it's not going to hold up for long without more resources and enough credits to fill an XS Freighter. See if you can chum up some of the contacts on my list and bring us more information on what's going on in the underbelly of the Eternal Empire. 

You bring me the people and the resources, and I'll show you what we can really do when our hands get greasy.

-Hylo</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1194326" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander,

I hear your name is making rounds in all the tales shared in the barracks, Commander. They see you as an icon of strength and perseverance, with rumors that you charged into the enemy's ranks on the back of a krayt dragon. Maybe I missed out on a new pet that you've been hiding around here--but that image alone is enough to give our troops a zeal that is beyond anything I've seen in all my career. There is always room to grow, but you've assured that our stockpiles are as bountiful as our morale. 

Keep up the great work. Our men and women will help us see this through.

-Admiral Bey'wan Aygo</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1194328" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander,

Morale continues to climb with each supply cache and recruit that you haul in. Keep bringing us the tools to succeed, and we'll keep showing the Eternal Empire a force that's not to be underestimated.

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1194336" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander,

I actually spotted some of our Republic and Imperial troops shaking hands prior to their last deployment, Commander. They're seeing themselves as one team, one Alliance, that has a chance to face the might of the Eternal Empire in earnest. You and I both know that they would still be at each other's throats if it weren't for your continued support and example. You're teaching them to put aside their differences for a cause that is greater than any individual. We can do this--but only if we are willing to stand together.

I don't need to tell you that we have neither the troops nor the resources to match the Eternal Empire. Our forces are still preoccupied with personal differences and old rivalries, and the lack of offensive hardware isn't helping the situation. We need more leaders and military assets to unify our men and women under this new Alliance. We need you to give us the muscle we need and bring some hope back to these people. I believe in your ability to get things done, Commander. Show the troops that my claims aren't misplaced. 

-Admiral Bey'wan Aygo</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1194348" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander,

You continue to supply us with a plenitude of brilliant minds and extraordinary technologies. It warms my heart to be surrounded by such enlightened kin. 

While we certainly clash on topics of ethics and moral liberalism, I do find motivation and a boundless desire to create in their company. Your assistance has certainly aided in maturing this Alliance into a hub of intellectual innovation, Commander. Our discoveries and inventions remain ceaseless.

Though I am undoubtedly the nucleus of genius in the laboratory, the new minds in my department are welcome additions. Our fields of expertise play well together, and we find new means of scientific inquiry with each new resource that you provide us. We could do with some organic subjects to test our theories and hasten our progress. Admiral Aygo was less than welcoming towards my request to procure injured troops that are unfit for active duty. Alas, he does not understand the concessions required to outwit our enemy. Perhaps you could convince him otherwise.

The sagacious minds of this Alliance require your assistance. How can an artist create his masterpiece with empty hands? We need materials to mold and like minds to succor. At present, our tools are grossly inferior.

I request that you probe the lengths of the galaxy for any and all scientific enigmas and intellectual savants to be found. We require outstanding vessels of body and mind to produce wonders that rival the Eternal Empire. See that my brilliance is not left to stagnate alone and unfulfilled.
