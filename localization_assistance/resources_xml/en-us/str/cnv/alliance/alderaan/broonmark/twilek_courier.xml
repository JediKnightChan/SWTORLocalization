		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188732" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi? Hey! You have to help me, I just got robbed and nearly killed!</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188733" id2="17" version="1065353216">My sympathies, but I've got an assassination attempt in need of thwarting.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188734" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm afraid muggings are a little low on my priority list at the moment.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188735" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess you're just part of whatever it is that's going on. They all came the same way you did.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188737" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Republic soldier? If you're part of whatever's been going on today, I don't want to be involved anymore than I am!</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188738" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm trying to catch up to a diplomat with an assassin on his tail. If you've got intel, time's a factor.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188739" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does that involve Wookiees?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188741" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, great, now Imperials... how unlucky can I get in one day? I don't want any trouble!</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188742" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me if you've seen any Wookiees come through here. Now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188743" id2="17" version="1065353216">Uh--yeah, actually. Ruined my day.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188745" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, so much more unlucky. Would you like something to really moan about?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188746" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, no, sorry, please! I just got robbed and all I want is to get home in one piece.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188748" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can guess that you didn't intend to be on foot out here.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188749" id2="17" version="1065353216">I got robbed!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188751" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey! Hey, I haven't got anything left! Police are on the way, okay? I don't want any trouble!</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188752" id2="17" version="1065353216">First of all, rude. Second, what are you going on about?</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188753" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I were here to rob you, I wouldn't bother asking.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188754" id2="17" version="1065353216">Okay, okay, sorry. It's been a rough day and I just want to get through it in one piece.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188756" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's terrible, tell me what happened.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188757" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not here to cause you any trouble. You've seen others come through here?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188758" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, whole bunch of crazies.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188760" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who are you and what are you doing out here?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188761" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm just a courier!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188763" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was on a delivery when a couple Wookiees came out of the woods into the middle of the road.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188765" id2="17" version="1065353216">They flagged down the speeder ahead of me and took off in it! I stopped to check on the driver and bam!</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188766" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bam?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188767" id2="17" version="1065353216">I get flung off my bike like I hit a low branch. I hear the other driver run off screaming and my swoop tearing off into the distance.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188769" id2="17" version="1065353216">Caught a glimpse of it speeding toward House Alde, just down the road, same as the Wookiees.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188770" id2="17" version="1065353216">That'll do. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188771" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need to follow them, good luck to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188772" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you find the one who took my bike, sock'em for me!</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188773" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shut up. I need to hurry.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188774" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a day....</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1188775" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just tell me which way they went.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1188776" id2="17" version="1065353216">Off toward House Alde, right along the road. Same as the thing that took my bike!</text>
