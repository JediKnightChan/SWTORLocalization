		<text bitflag="321" id1="1181887" id2="17" version="1065353216">You wouldn't believe the stuff they dug up over at sixteen. Pharb showed me this freaky looking mask he found. All painted up and thorny. I think it's even made of bone. Said he was going to keep it locked up back at base camp until he could send it home. Not my choice of memento, but I guess no one will miss it.</text>

I've heard of this kind of thing, it's a freaking ghost! He's coming for that mask, I know it. Maybe it's cursed. I saw it. Does that mean I'm next? I've got to get out of here.</text>
