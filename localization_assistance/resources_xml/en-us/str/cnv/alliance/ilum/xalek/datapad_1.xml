		<text bitflag="321" id1="1182286" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, turns out someone else thought this cave was a pretty safe place to stay too. Found some signs of life. Some small temple, or shrine maybe, is sitting right on the crystal seam. Pharb thinks it's probably some long-dead primitive's worship spot, but it doesn't look all that old if you ask me. Sent word to the foreman, but we're probably losing at least a day to sorting this out.</text>

I'll bet corporate didn't bother trying to sort out who might have the rights to cultural artifacts. Won't matter once the digging starts. Kind of a shame, someone put a lot of care into the thing. Maybe I'll take a holo.</text>
