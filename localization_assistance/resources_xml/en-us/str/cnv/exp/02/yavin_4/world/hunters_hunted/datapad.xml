Well, that didn't work out.

The Massassi were on us as soon as we left the drop zone. They don't watch from the shadows anymore--we're their new favorite prey.

The team went down fast. Survivors got dragged in the direction of the Massassi village. Enemy must have assumed the hole in my gut had killed me. If you're reading this, my one-woman rescue attempt ended badly.

Sorry to disappoint you, Major Tso. You always said a rich girl like me shouldn't be in charge. Guess you win the argument by default.</text>
