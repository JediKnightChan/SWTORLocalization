		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136952" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry, but I have things to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136953" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did it. You're sure you did it? Dastid wears armor....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136955" id2="17" version="1065353216">Trust us--armor melts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136956" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Kanawyn Syndicate is finished. Its leaders are dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136957" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. Really, thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136959" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't--I don't like having people killed. But we had to. Not just for the business, but for my mom. She'd be glad it was you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136960" id2="17" version="1065353216">Crysta went down fighting for the sake of her family. That's not a lot of comfort, but it should mean something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1136960" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least she died well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136961" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. I know. I get it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136963" id2="17" version="1065353216">Spread the word. I don't like having my rep questioned, and the Syndicate won't be talking.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1136963" id2="17" version="1065353216">It should help my reputation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136964" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rishi's isolated, but people will hear. Don't worry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136966" id2="17" version="1065353216">You wanted them killed and I killed them. No one's asking for justification.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1136966" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get over it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136967" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fair enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136969" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said you wouldn't charge, but Crysta would never accept charity. I've transferred a little to your accounts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136971" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got your money, as promised. Everything I have without selling what's left of the business.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136973" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can I ask you something, though? I know you're not, like, a citizen, but--you must have opinions about working in the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136974" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't last as a bounty hunter by judging your clients. I stick by that. Mostly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1136974" id2="17" version="1065353216">My job isn't to have opinions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136975" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's complicated, but... if we weren't doing the work, someone else would. And at least we're professionals.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136977" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course. I'm not questioning your decisions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136979" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;The Empire&quot; is a name on a map. I deal with people, and Imperials are as tough and smart as anyone. Maybe a little proud, is all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1136979" id2="17" version="1065353216">The people aren't so bad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136980" id2="17" version="1065353216">And a little crazy. Still better than Hutts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136982" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want the truth? Those people don't have a clue what they're doing. But... they keep my work interesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1136982" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lunatics and fools, all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136983" id2="17" version="1065353216">Guess that's not easy when you're running out of things to kill.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136985" id2="17" version="1065353216">So--just a thought--you must be big enough to have some authority there. Priority access, clearance codes, that sort of thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136986" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you suggesting?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136987" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now that my business is safe, I want to expand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136989" id2="17" version="1065353216">You could get me access to Dromund Kaas; I could sell contraband to a whole new market. We'd both profit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136990" id2="17" version="1065353216">No spice, no slaves. Otherwise, we have a deal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1136990" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine, but nothing harmful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136991" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're asking me to work with one hand tied behind my back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136992" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you don't like it, you can walk away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136993" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, I can--I can make it work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136995" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we have to betray our client's trust, I suppose it could be worse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136997" id2="17" version="1065353216">Some people might say you were getting soft. If they knew. But they won't.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1136999" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you again. For Crysta, not just the business.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137000" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come on, Mako. We've got jobs waiting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137002" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not in the business of crime. If you don't understand that, I doubt you understood Crysta.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137002" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not what I do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137003" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't have the right to say that. When's the last time gang trouble even scared you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137005" id2="17" version="1065353216">You used to work for Nem'ro the Hutt. You used to get your hands dirty!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137007" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come on. We did what we came to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137009" id2="17" version="1065353216">And if that's the life we left behind... maybe we're better off. Maybe we shouldn't miss it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137010" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not a bad proposal. All right--let's do business.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137010" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like the way you think.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137011" id2="17" version="1065353216">What?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137013" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will she be a problem?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137014" id2="17" version="1065353216">No problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137015" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fantastic. I promise, I'm a good partner. I'll show the capital what it's been missing--the really good stuff.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137017" id2="17" version="1065353216">We probably shouldn't be seen together, though. So: thank you again. For Crysta, not just the business.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137019" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will you sell out anyone? Or just the Empire?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137020" id2="17" version="1065353216">We put up with too much from the Sith and the military. So far as I'm concerned, we earned this money.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137020" id2="17" version="1065353216">Think of it as compensation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137021" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then you can keep it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137023" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're not breaking any promises. Why do you care about Imperials?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137023" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm surprised you object.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137024" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't, it's just--we're not criminals. We're bounty hunters. We supposed to enforce the law--our law--not break it on purpose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137026" id2="17" version="1065353216">After all this time, you really think I care about your objections?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137026" id2="17" version="1065353216">Save it for someone else.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137027" id2="17" version="1065353216">You wouldn't be here without Crysta, and you wouldn't be here without me. Maybe you'll never see that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137029" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's go. We've got other jobs to worry about.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137031" id2="17" version="1065353216">They deserve worse, you know. Killing them is being nice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137034" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks for doing this. Crysta was crazy, but I kind of liked her. If something's happened....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137035" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thera Markon?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137036" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stars, you're like a walking--does anything you're wearing not kill people?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137037" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said Crysta was dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137038" id2="17" version="1065353216">My mom. Yeah. She talked about both of you--she hunted for years, wanted me to take up the business, but coaching you was her biggest win.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137040" id2="17" version="1065353216">She got a rep for it. You made her respected again. She liked that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137041" id2="17" version="1065353216">We weren't friends, but Crysta gave me a fair shot. Tell me what happened to her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137041" id2="17" version="1065353216">Crysta was good people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137042" id2="17" version="1065353216">Crysta didn't talk much about her life. She wanted you to be a bounty hunter?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137042" id2="17" version="1065353216">Were you two close?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137043" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I was a kid, she'd leave me at home while she was out chasing marks. She'd come back smiling and bruised.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137045" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't like bruising. She was disappointed, but we stayed in touch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137046" id2="17" version="1065353216">So what happened?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137047" id2="17" version="1065353216">How long are you going to talk without paying me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137047" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're wasting time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137048" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're impatient--I get that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137050" id2="17" version="1065353216">I run a small shipping concern. Direct-to-customer regulated goods.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137051" id2="17" version="1065353216">Smuggling.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137052" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right. Crysta got killed protecting my business from the Kanawyn Syndicate. Thugs dealing in weapons and spice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137054" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kanawyns have been after me for months--they want my routes, my customers. Crysta's rep--your rep--made them keep their distance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137055" id2="17" version="1065353216">I take it they don't keep their distance anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137055" id2="17" version="1065353216">What changed?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137056" id2="17" version="1065353216">What sort of chatter is there about this Syndicate?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137056" id2="17" version="1065353216">You heard of these guys, Mako?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137057" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know it's pretty small--just a few dozen men, but with serious credentials. They skinned an Exchange boss who wouldn't join.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137059" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you want them dead for Crysta? Or is this just business?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137059" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now you want revenge?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137060" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not just business. She was my mother.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137062" id2="17" version="1065353216">A few weeks back, they started harassing me again. Crysta showed up. I might have mentioned your name, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137064" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Kanawyns said they wouldn't fall for it this time. They said mom was washed up. They said you're Imperial now--you don't do underworld jobs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137066" id2="17" version="1065353216">They didn't say that. That's not okay!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137068" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everyone says it. That you escaped the life to become, I don't know--Dark Council enforcers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137070" id2="17" version="1065353216">They killed mom, but I still have money. I'm putting a bounty on the Kanawyns. I want their bosses in a bloody heap.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137071" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've done gang sweeps before. What approach did you have in mind?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137071" id2="17" version="1065353216">Okay. Give me the details.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137072" id2="17" version="1065353216">I owe Crysta Markon, and I pay my debts. Forget the credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137072" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep your money. I'll do it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137073" id2="17" version="1065353216">Okay. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137075" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're telling the truth, then I have a message to send. I'll take the job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137075" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one doubts my reputation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137076" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't lie. You terrify me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137078" id2="17" version="1065353216">Finding the Kanawyns won't be hard. Start at the bottom, work your way to the leaders: Avax, Chrone, and Dastid.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137080" id2="17" version="1065353216">Avax used to be an assassin for the Chevin Conglomerate. Brutal, kind of a sadist. Chrone's her brother, former slaver, loves his guns.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137082" id2="17" version="1065353216">And Dastid?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137084" id2="17" version="1065353216">Worked for the Cartel until Makeb happened. Hit a colony ship once, spaced five hundred people on board. Watch out for him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137085" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll hit those three after the rank and file. Where do I look?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137086" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got a list of their hangouts. I'll stay in touch over comm, if you want.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137088" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want you to know--I appreciate this. Crysta would, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137116" id2="17" version="1065353216">What? No. Not now.</text>
