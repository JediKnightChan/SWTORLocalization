		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140147" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's my droid. You've got my droid. He was... we were mapping unexplored space. Rishi was our resupply point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140149" id2="17" version="1065353216">When the Nova Blades took him, I thought we'd lost years of work. Hundreds of star charts, inhabited planets... you want a copy, it's yours.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140160" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh-eight? I am not receiving. Repeat, I am not receiving. Where are you?</text>
