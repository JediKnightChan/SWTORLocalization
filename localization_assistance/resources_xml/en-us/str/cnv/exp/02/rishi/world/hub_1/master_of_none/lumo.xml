		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140125" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll take every Nova Blade still standing, I swear it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140128" id2="17" version="1065353216">So Kendruh's dead? If that's his list of our families, you'll get all the help you need. No one on the fence, no one holding back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140131" id2="17" version="1065353216">You really want us to fight back, get to Kendruh first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140133" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who are you? Did you escape from the slavers?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140134" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're blasted right--and soon as I can, I'm going back to fight. If you're going in first, listen up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140136" id2="17" version="1065353216">Slavemaster Kendruh doesn't just hurt us. He keeps records on our families, says he'll track them down if we rebel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140138" id2="17" version="1065353216">So far as I'm concerned, he has to die first, and his black book of secrets needs to be found. Otherwise, half the slaves in there won't fight back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140141" id2="17" version="1065353216">Careful--I escaped, but they're hunting for me. Don't let them catch you, too.</text>
