		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1132878" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have fun with the Mandalorians. I hear they're real easy to talk to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1132881" id2="17" version="1065353216">Margok is losing his mind over you!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1132884" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's hit those Blades where it counts--in the profits.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134109" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome back!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134111" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've achieved more in your short time here than we ever thought possible. You should be proud.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134112" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's kind of you to say. Perhaps working together like this means there's hope for a more peaceful future.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134112" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, Lana.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134113" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps so.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134115" id2="17" version="1065353216">What I achieve, I do through patience and the guidance of the Force. You could do the same, if you chose to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134115" id2="17" version="1065353216">You could be like me, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134116" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take your attempt to convert me as a compliment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134118" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't achieve all of this. We did. Working together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134118" id2="17" version="1065353216">Teamwork was the key.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134119" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps a sign of better things to come.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134121" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm usually pretty modest, but just this once I'll admit it: I am the most amazing person alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134121" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're right: I'm awesome.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134122" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hah!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134124" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think seeing that smile of yours is a much better achievement for the day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134124" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] I'm glad you're happy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134125" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now you're just teasing me....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134127" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then you understand why the Jedi are going to win this war in the end.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134127" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is why Jedi are superior.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134128" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come now. We're working together so well--why ruin it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134130" id2="17" version="1065353216">Say whatever you want--I'm never going to forget who and what you are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134130" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't want your praise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134131" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rather a strong grudge for a Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134133" id2="17" version="1065353216">Compliments from a Sith don't mean much. Save your breath.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134133" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't want your praise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134134" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you say so....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134136" id2="17" version="1065353216">A compliment from the killer Sith Lord! I'm touched. Really.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134136" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't want your praise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134137" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have it your way....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1134139" id2="17" version="1065353216">Droid! They're all just standing around talking. You said this would be a party!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134141" id2="17" version="1065353216">I also said we should stop for decorations on the way! Now the party's terrible, and it's our fault as much as theirs!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134143" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey. Slicing the Nova Blade files is slow going, but I've already found more references to this Torch person that Margok and Revan were talking about.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134145" id2="17" version="1065353216">She definitely heads up a group of Mandalorians based here on Rishi. They were allied with the Revanites, but then broke ties--and not on good terms.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134147" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we can find Torch and get her talking, she might give us some good intel. Maybe even help us take the Revanites on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134148" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've fought my share of Mandalorians. It would be nice to have some on our side for a change.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134148" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds good to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134149" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134151" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't know anything for sure yet. It's best to be cautious when it comes to Mandalorians.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134151" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's not get our hopes up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134152" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fair enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134154" id2="17" version="1065353216">These people kill for credits. They're more trouble than they're worth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134154" id2="17" version="1065353216">Mandos can't be trusted.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134155" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think that's a risk worth taking, don't you? Otherwise we're just sitting around here waiting for the computer to finish.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134157" id2="17" version="1065353216">It looks like Torch and her crew control their own island not far from here. Think you could head over and see what she has to say?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134158" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll contact you once I've found Torch. Let me know as soon as you pull anything else out of the Nova Blade files.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134158" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134159" id2="17" version="1065353216">You got it. Good luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134161" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, since you asked so nicely....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134161" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] For you? Anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134162" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stay safe out there, all right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134164" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is going to end badly. Wait and see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134164" id2="17" version="1065353216">Got a bad feeling about this....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134165" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure you can handle one aging crew of Mandalorians.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1134167" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get some drinks while you're out! This party won't get better on its own....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134193" id2="17" version="1065353216">I got the slaves off of the island.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134194" id2="17" version="1065353216">We heard. Word of your raids is going around fast. Even the Revanites have heard about the great Red Hulls.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134196" id2="17" version="1065353216">We just intercepted this transmission from the Nova Blades' headquarters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134198" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is ridiculous! How am I supposed to hold up our part of the deal if you won't give us any backup when we're in trouble?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134200" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then perhaps we should seek other allies. I'm sure there are other crews on this planet who are capable of managing their own affairs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134202" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, we've done our share! You wanted the shipping lanes raided, we raided 'em! You wanted stragglers picked off from the big battles, we did it!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134204" id2="17" version="1065353216">And your clumsiness cost us our Mandalorian allies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134206" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torch and her crew of old fossils? We're better off without 'em.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134208" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I'm beginning to think we're better off without you. Deal with your own problems if you want to prove otherwise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134209" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have Revan and his followers fooled. We'd better move quickly--if they cut the Nova Blades out, there may not be any information left to recover.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134209" id2="17" version="1065353216">The plan worked perfectly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134210" id2="17" version="1065353216">I agree. Speed is essential now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134212" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you know anything about the Mandalorians they mentioned?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134212" id2="17" version="1065353216">They mentioned Mandalorians....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134213" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've heard people around town mention Torch, but I didn't realize she was tied to the Blades or the Revanites. Might be a good lead for later.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134215" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right now, though, I think we should press our advantage against the Nova Blades.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134217" id2="17" version="1065353216">So that was Revan? Somehow, I expected more.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134217" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan doesn't look so scary.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134218" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we keep this up, Revan won't have anyone left to keep his secrets.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134218" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan's running out of friends.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134219" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's managed to do a lot. I don't think it's wise to count him out just yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134221" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll deal with Revan soon enough. For now, we should focus on the Nova Blades.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134223" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134225" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Nova Blades are based out of an old crashed warship: the Aggressor. You've probably seen it, off in the distance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134227" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need to hit them hard--make it look like the goal is to completely crush them, so nobody notices when we raid their computer cores for intel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134229" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jakarro is refueling his ship as we speak. While you approach the Aggressor, you can use your target designator to call for his assistance, just like before.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134230" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll contact you as soon as I reach the Aggressor. And then we can finally get the answers we need.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134231" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our enemy is cornered, but not helpless. I'll proceed cautiously and contact you when I reach the Aggressor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134232" id2="17" version="1065353216">May the Force be with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134233" id2="17" version="1065353216">Understood. Once I'm ready to breach the Aggressor, I'll contact you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134234" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like fun. I'll get in touch when I hit the Aggressor, so you can start putting together a victory party at the cantina.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134235" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's not get ahead of ourselves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134237" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134275" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Nova Blades have a pretty good setup here. They're not gonna enjoy watching it crumble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134278" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134281" id2="17" version="1065353216">Theron? Lana? You're the ones behind all of this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134282" id2="17" version="1065353216">Guilty as charged. Sorry if we put you out, but we had to be cautious.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134284" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Revanites have gone to increasingly severe lengths to hunt us down since we destroyed their operations on Rakata Prime.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134286" id2="17" version="1065353216">We had to get you here to help us without leaving a trail. Sorry we couldn't be more... direct.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134287" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure you wouldn't have done all of this without a good reason. What have you found?</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134289" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd been hoping to recruit your help with this problem for quite a while, actually. Your record speaks for itself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134291" id2="17" version="1065353216">And, as it happens, our list of trustworthy allies is rather short at the moment.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134316" id2="17" version="1065353216">Honestly, it's too bad you never pursued thuggery as a profession. You're taking to it quite well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134318" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can see why you chose your profession. You take to these underworld sorts quite naturally.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134320" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need to go after the pirates that run things on Rishi--the Nova Blades.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134322" id2="17" version="1065353216">They butcher entire starship crews and enslave anyone on Rishi who stands up to them. And now we've learned that they're working with the Revanites.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134324" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Nova Blades are being sent to attack trade lanes in very specific areas. They've gradually remapped quite a bit of stellar traffic. It's all very strange.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134332" id2="17" version="1065353216">Exactly. We need to figure out what those goals are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134334" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Revanites have some major expenses. Maybe the pirates are just helping them cover costs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134334" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everybody needs credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134335" id2="17" version="1065353216">That may well be part of it. But there's more... a pattern, though we can't determine its purpose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134337" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our team isn't exactly normal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134339" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one would expect a Jedi, a Sith, and a spy to work together, but here we are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134340" id2="17" version="1065353216">They've got Revanites and pirates, we've got Special Forces, a covert agent, and a Sith lord. I think we've got them beat in the &quot;strange&quot; department.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134341" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revanites teaming up with pirates isn't any weirder than our little group. A smuggler, a spy, and a Sith lord... sounds like the set-up for a good joke, actually....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134342" id2="17" version="1065353216">Circumstance alone brought us together. The Revanites chose their allies very specifically. We must learn why.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134344" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, in all your time here, you've learned that some pirates are doing some raiding. Top-notch work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134344" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is all you've found?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134345" id2="17" version="1065353216">They aren't raiding for themselves--that's the point. They could be making far more credits elsewhere. This is all the Revanites' doing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134347" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need to shake the Nova Blades down, find out what they know. Their computers could tell us everything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134349" id2="17" version="1065353216">But a direct attack on the Blades' base now might make the Revanites suspicious. We need to hide our real motives.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134350" id2="17" version="1065353216">So that's why you told everyone I'm a pirate. When I attack them, it will look like a fight between gangs, instead of a targeted move.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Exactly. Now, before we send you for the main event, we should hit a few other Nova Blade holdings to solidify the cover story.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134353" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Blades have a supply cache hidden nearby. Once the &quot;Red Hulls&quot; have destroyed it, word should spread quickly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134357" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have some... mutual friends who are excited to help with the task. They'll meet you in the field to settle the details.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134358" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jakarro and Ceetoo Deefour?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134359" id2="17" version="1065353216">The very same.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134363" id2="17" version="1065353216">Theron and I have a pair of... associates... who will be aiding you in this task. They'll meet you in the field with more details.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134364" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can I trust them?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134365" id2="17" version="1065353216">With information? Yes, they know everything we do. They can get a little carried away, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134367" id2="17" version="1065353216">While you're hitting the supply cache, we'll keep spreading the word about your &quot;grudge&quot; and see if we can find any other targets. Sound good?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134368" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll get out there right away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134368" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134369" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just be sure you don't make things too colorful. People think I'm bad enough as it is.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134369" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't exaggerate too much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134370" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think going after the Nova Blades should increase your popularity quite a bit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134372" id2="17" version="1065353216">You two have put me through quite a bit already. This had better go smoothly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1134372" id2="17" version="1065353216">This plan better work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134373" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the spirit....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134375" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134379" id2="17" version="1065353216">Theron? Lana? I didn't expect to find you here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134380" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our situation became rather grave after the operation on Manaan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134382" id2="17" version="1065353216">We tracked Colonel Darok and Darth Arkous to a facility on Rakata Prime. They were going to mass-produce the cyborgs they developed in their research lab.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134384" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jakarro and Deefour helped us defeat them, but we still barely escaped with our lives. And we discovered that Darok and Arkous weren't the ones in charge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134386" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan is alive. Apparently, he's the one running the whole show. He's got some kind of grand plan, and Rishi is a part of it--that's why we're here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134387" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was there when we freed Revan from an Imperial prison. Why has he turned on us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134388" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan was an ally of the Republic--why would he turn against us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134389" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wish I knew.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134393" id2="17" version="1065353216">Theron Shan... so you're behind all of this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134394" id2="17" version="1065353216">Afraid so. Things have gotten... complicated... since we last spoke.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134396" id2="17" version="1065353216">You remember our conversation in the cantina? How the attacks on Tython and Korriban seemed suspicious? I tracked down the truth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134398" id2="17" version="1065353216">Colonel Darok was a traitor--and he wasn't the only one. The Republic and the Empire have both been infiltrated by members of the Order of Revan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134400" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's why I'm here. Lana Beniko.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134401" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Sith?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134402" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not in good standing, if that's at all reassuring. This cult is a threat to the Empire as well as the Republic. They've infiltrated the highest levels of both our governments.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134404" id2="17" version="1065353216">At first, we thought Colonel Darok and his Imperial accomplice were in charge. We even destroyed an operation they had going on the planet Rakata Prime. That's where we uncovered their real leader.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134408" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who are you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134409" id2="17" version="1065353216">My name is Theron Shan. I'm an agent for the Strategic Information Service... or used to be, anyway.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1134411" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic has been infiltrated. The Empire, too. Both sides are being manipulated by a secret cult: the Order of Revan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135084" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Aggressor must have been quite a ship, back when it could actually fly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135085" id2="17" version="1065353216">I doubt the Nova Blades set up all of this data security on their own. The Revanites must've given them a helping hand. This is going to take a while....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141088" id2="17" version="1065353216">Barsen'thor, I'm glad to see you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141090" id2="17" version="1065353216">Masters Bestros and Gnost-Dural send their best--we miss your insight on the Jedi Council.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141091" id2="17" version="1065353216">I miss the Council's debates, Grand Master. But alas, Tython isn't where I'm needed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141091" id2="17" version="1065353216">Always a pleasure, Satele.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141092" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have a lot to discuss.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141094" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why do I have the feeling the Council prefers me at a distance?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141094" id2="17" version="1065353216">I doubt anyone's missed me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141095" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't say. You're always welcome on Tython--even when there's not an invasion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141096" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Satele, a lot has happened since we last spoke...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141097" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've heard rumors. But I can't guarantee this channel is secure, so I'd rather you safeguard your secrets. Just listen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141099" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Jedi Council must do more than react to crises--we must see to the future of the Order and the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141101" id2="17" version="1065353216">What we've seen in war, the truths we've learned, will be our gift to later generations. And few Jedi have seen or learned more than you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141102" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our understanding of the Esh-kha, the Emperor's Children, even the shielding technique that defeated Terrak Morrhage--it could all be lost if we take no pains to preserve it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141102" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want my lore preserved...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141104" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've done no more than any Jedi. You were there at the war's beginning, you rediscovered Tython....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141104" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm nothing special.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141105" id2="17" version="1065353216">Years ago. And humility is no virtue when it blinds.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141107" id2="17" version="1065353216">Worrying about our legacy seems premature when we may not survive to leave one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141107" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have more urgent concerns.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141108" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then why are we Jedi? Or put that aside, and think of your own evolution.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141110" id2="17" version="1065353216">In truth, you are becoming one of the greatest Force users our Order has ever seen. You stand witness to our era's conflicts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141112" id2="17" version="1065353216">But to reach your full potential, you must test yourself--and there's one trial you've yet to undertake.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141113" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want me to construct a holocron.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141114" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes. You've contributed to holocrons before, but we need a full archive of your history, your thoughts--a record to continue all your life, as you grow, learn and change.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141115" id2="17" version="1065353216">As you said, we have a duty to the future, and I feel the burden keenly. But I've had no opportunities to act.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141115" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been thinking about it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141117" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do you suggest I proceed, Master Satele?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141118" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't object--but why a holocron instead of a written record? It would certainly be simpler.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141118" id2="17" version="1065353216">What makes holocrons special?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141119" id2="17" version="1065353216">A holocron is attuned to the Force. When you unlocked the Noetikons on Coruscant, would a document have sufficed instead?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141121" id2="17" version="1065353216">My ways aren't traditional Jedi ways. Are you sure you want them passed down?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141121" id2="17" version="1065353216">You may not like my teachings.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141122" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your ways have earned my respect, if not my understanding. Let posterity be our judge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141124" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've granted the request of Master Kutri O'a to seek you out. He is a prophet and a master of the holocron's craft.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141126" id2="17" version="1065353216">He wishes to aid you in the device's construction. He's come to Rishi, believing the Force has willed it. You might be flattered.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141127" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where is he?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141128" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll send coordinates.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141130" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have much to offer our successors, and much to learn. Do what you must, and may the Force be with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141132" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everything you just heard? It's important. Remember it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141134" id2="17" version="1065353216">But... it can wait a little while. There's something I want you to see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141135" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who's there?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141136" id2="17" version="1065353216">Follow your feelings, and you'll find it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141138" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, if it isn't the Voidhound himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141140" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know, I ran into your pirates on Port Nowhere. It's cute how they fight to be your favorite.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141141" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know there's a Republic representative to Port Nowhere, now? It's almost like you cleaned up the place.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141142" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know, no one believed me on Port Nowhere when I said we'd met. Probably good for your rep.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141145" id2="17" version="1065353216">Beryl Thorn. Still sore about Taris?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141146" id2="17" version="1065353216">Most of the bruises are gone, so only a little.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141148" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look, I saw you were around, and against my better judgment I thought I'd call.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141151" id2="17" version="1065353216">Beryl Thorn. How long's it been? Since Quesh?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141152" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's not talk about Quesh. I still have a rash from the fumes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141154" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look, I saw you were on Rishi and thought I'd run something past you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141156" id2="17" version="1065353216">An opportunity's come up. How would you like to make a fortune together?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Been a while since I had an offer like that. You know I'm in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you even need to ask?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141158" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good, because I'm out a crew and this is a two-person job, minimum.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141160" id2="17" version="1065353216">Make a fortune together, smuggle core samples together... whatever you need me for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141160" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] For you? Always.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141161" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just the fortune for today.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141163" id2="17" version="1065353216">Swing by my ship and we'll talk. Beryl out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141164" id2="17" version="1065353216">You never struck me as the get-rich-quick type. More the practical, helpful, scary-when-she's-cornered type.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141164" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're awfully confident.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141165" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks, I guess. But this is something I've been thinking about awhile.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141167" id2="17" version="1065353216">Normally I'd love to, but the galaxy needs saving and I'm apparently the only one who knows how.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141167" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm a little busy right now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141168" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're really committed to this whole protector-of-the-Republic bit, aren't you? Come on, you can make a little time. Might even broaden your horizons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141170" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be at my ship. Meet me if you want.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141172" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, if it isn't the Voidhound herself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141176" id2="17" version="1065353216">Major. I understand Havoc is engaged on Rishi without official orders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141177" id2="17" version="1065353216">General Garza. It's complicated, sir...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141178" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't need an explanation. I need you to place your mission on hold and rendezvous near the spaceport.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141180" id2="17" version="1065353216">Something's come up. I'll brief you in person.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141181" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please confirm, General. You're going to rendezvous with Havoc on Rishi?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141181" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're coming here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141182" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not with Havoc--with you. I'll explain everything shortly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141184" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's going on, General? I haven't received orders from you since Corellia.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141184" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been a long time, sir.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141185" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm happy to discuss that, Major--in person.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141187" id2="17" version="1065353216">This signal is encrypted, but the longer we talk the more likely it is to be tracked. Understood?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141188" id2="17" version="1065353216">Understood, sir.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141189" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good. Garza out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141190" id2="17" version="1065353216">With due respect, sir, I've uncovered evidence of a conspiracy inside Republic ranks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1141190" id2="17" version="1065353216">This seems suspicious.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141192" id2="17" version="1065353216">Until that's dealt with, it might be safer for us to keep our distance from one another.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141193" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know what you're suggesting, Major, and I don't like it. I am still your commanding officer, and I am ordering you to these coordinates.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1141195" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anything else we'll need to discuss in person. This signal is encrypted, but if we talk longer it will be tracked. Garza out.</text>
