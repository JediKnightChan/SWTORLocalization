		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1132396" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kai Zykken, greetings. I speak to you now to deliver a warning.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1132398" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Howling Tempest Gang is one of the galaxy's most feared pirate associations. They have just now set their sights on Rishi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1132400" id2="17" version="1065353216">As you know, the Corellian Run Scoundrels owe the Howling Tempest Gang a great many credits. There is no telling what will happen when you are discovered.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1132402" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suggest you herald the gang's arrival to draw unwanted attention on them; I'm dispatching several droids across Raider's Cove to do the same.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1132404" id2="17" version="1065353216">Or you could do nothing and suffer the consequences. The choice is yours.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1133808" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Red Hulls may be the galaxy's most bloodthirsty and sadistic pirate crew. And they're heading toward Rishi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1133810" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure you remember the debt that you owe the Red Hulls. Quite a few credits... not something they're likely to forget.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1133813" id2="17" version="1065353216">My droids are spreading word of their arrival. If you were to do the same... they might be too distracted to come after you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1133814" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kai Zykken? Greetings. I have important information for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1133819" id2="17" version="1065353216">The choice is yours, of course.</text>
