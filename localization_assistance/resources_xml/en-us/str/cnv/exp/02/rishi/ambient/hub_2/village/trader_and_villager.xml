		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1142098" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh! But it's everyone's village, not just ours. You are always welcome!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1142100" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, not the village itself, but... you know, the others. Each time I come back the daggers in their eyes get bigger, know what I'm saying?</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1142104" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, count your blessings. Whoever these characters are, they're about as serious as it gets....</text>
