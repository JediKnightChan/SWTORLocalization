		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140166" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, I'm not looking for any trouble--are those my biosamples? We were smuggling those to a research buddy of mine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140168" id2="17" version="1065353216">Make you a deal--I pay for those, his company gives you and your buddies first shot at whatever he's making. Agreed?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140171" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nova Blades shot down a friend's ship--just thought I'd take a peek.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140174" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, I can't get any closer. Nova Blades shot the ship down--what makes you think they won't shoot me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140176" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look, I'm losing your signal, and I think someone's listening. Let's just hope the Nova Blades don't search the wreckage before we get those biosamples back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140178" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got a buyer all lined up, and he says they're just what his company needs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140181" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't cause you trouble. Just making a holocall, here.</text>
