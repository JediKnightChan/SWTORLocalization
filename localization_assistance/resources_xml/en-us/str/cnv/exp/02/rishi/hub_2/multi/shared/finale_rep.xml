		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135397" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. Thank you. I'm fine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135399" id2="17" version="1065353216">All right. Off to a good start....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135400" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Satele. Thank you for coming.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135401" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135403" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do we have casualty reports from the fleet battle?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135404" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was bad, but it could have been much worse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135406" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's with all the sour faces? Did somebody start a war or something?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135407" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not helping....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135409" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Revanite ships have all been scattered, captured, or destroyed. Their accomplices aboard our vessels are in chains.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135411" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan is still alive, my lord. And his plans don't stop here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135413" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor is not dead. Revan thinks he can fix that--but he's wrong, isn't he?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135415" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one person--not even Revan--can truly destroy the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135416" id2="17" version="1065353216">I struck the Emperor down myself. I saw him die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135416" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then who did I kill?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135417" id2="17" version="1065353216">You destroyed his body. Even wounded his spirit... perhaps more than anyone before you. But that was not enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135419" id2="17" version="1065353216">I sense fear in you, Marr. If your Emperor cannot be destroyed, why fear Revan?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135419" id2="17" version="1065353216">That isn't the whole truth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135420" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would welcome the Emperor's destruction. Revan's meddling will bring quite the opposite.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135422" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care how much Force nonsense is involved--anybody can be killed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135422" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one is indestructible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135423" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor can be destroyed. But not by Revan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135425" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan isn't exactly alone in this. We've stopped a lot of his followers, but who knows how many more he's got?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135425" id2="17" version="1065353216">He does have a few friends....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135426" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Revan wants to kill the Emperor, why are we concerned?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135426" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why not let Revan try?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135427" id2="17" version="1065353216">Because he will fail. And his failure will have consequences for us all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135429" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course you'd say he's indestructible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135429" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pure Sith lies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135430" id2="17" version="1065353216">I do not speak with pride or misplaced faith. I know the depths of the Emperor's true power--and the true ramifications of Revan's interference.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135432" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor's current state is... nebulous. Incorporeal. To strike at him, Revan will first have to return him to a physical form.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135434" id2="17" version="1065353216">Which is exactly what the Emperor wants.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135436" id2="17" version="1065353216">He will destroy Revan, then move on to the rest of us. In time, he will consume all life in the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135437" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do we prevent it? How do we stop Revan?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135437" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have to stop it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135438" id2="17" version="1065353216">How is that possible?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135439" id2="17" version="1065353216">You knew that was his goal, and still followed him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135439" id2="17" version="1065353216">You admit your leader is crazy?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135440" id2="17" version="1065353216">I only learned of his true plans recently. And I am no more interested in being fuel for his insanity than you are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135442" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have to stop this--intercept Revan before he can restore the Emperor's form.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135444" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor's hideaway is a secret, even to the Dark Council.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135446" id2="17" version="1065353216">The fourth moon of Yavin. That's where we'll find Revan. He wanted me to join him there... never said I couldn't bring a few friends.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135448" id2="17" version="1065353216">According to our data, he still has extensive forces at his disposal. We would stand a better chance of overcoming them together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135450" id2="17" version="1065353216">No matter what evidence I present, I doubt the Supreme Chancellor will agree to any kind of alliance or truce.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135452" id2="17" version="1065353216">Neither will the Dark Council. But my ships and the soldiers aboard them are loyal to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135454" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can convince my troops to maintain a truce. They've seen Revan's threat firsthand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135455" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then we meet on Yavin Four.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135456" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135457" id2="17" version="1065353216">Next stop, Yavin Four.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135458" id2="17" version="1065353216">Very well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135460" id2="17" version="1065353216">Theron....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135462" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can talk on the way to Yavin. I have some business to finish here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135464" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for your help. All of you. This can't have been easy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135466" id2="17" version="1065353216">The conspiracy is finally exposed. We've been hiding our actions from our allies for so long... it's a relief to have everything in the open.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135468" id2="17" version="1065353216">So we can talk about how you threw me to the wolves, now?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1135470" id2="17" version="1065353216">So that's why you stopped me!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135472" id2="17" version="1065353216">I made a calculated strategic decision. And it worked, as we can all see now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135474" id2="17" version="1065353216">And if you'd talked to me about it, I would've volunteered. But you didn't even give me a choice!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135476" id2="17" version="1065353216">We couldn't risk the Revanites knowing that your capture was a ploy. You had to be in the dark for the plan to work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135477" id2="17" version="1065353216">Theron had a right to know the danger he was going into, Lana. You should never have hidden the truth from him--or the rest of us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135477" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's no excuse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135478" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Revanites knew your capture was staged, they would've killed you, and we wouldn't have learned Revan's plan. Hiding the truth was probably the best option.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135478" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lana has a point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135479" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care what your excuse is, Sith. You lied to us. Do it again, and it will be the last time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135479" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lie again and you're dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135480" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will do whatever serves our goal best. Defeating Revan must outweigh all other concerns.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135482" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think it's time we moved on. Yavin is a long way from here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135486" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed. Let's get moving.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135487" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been too long since we really talked, Theron. Can you stay for a while?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135487" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] Theron--stay a moment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135488" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135490" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have a safe trip to Yavin!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135492" id2="17" version="1065353216">Guess you'll think twice next time a spy asks you out for a &quot;quick chat.&quot; Wouldn't want to go through all this again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135493" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have been through a lot, haven't we?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135493" id2="17" version="1065353216">This wasn't what I expected.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135494" id2="17" version="1065353216">To put it mildly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135496" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you kidding? This is the most fun I've had in a long time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135496" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd gladly do it all again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135497" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know if I'd go that far. But good company helps.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135499" id2="17" version="1065353216">I could definitely imagine more relaxing ways to spend my time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135499" id2="17" version="1065353216">It hasn't exactly been fun, no.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135500" id2="17" version="1065353216">Me too. At least there was good company for the ride.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135502" id2="17" version="1065353216">I may have mentioned this before, but I've never been much of a team player. Things usually go better for me when I'm on my own.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135504" id2="17" version="1065353216">Relying on someone else has been interesting. I'm beginning to think I should've started a long time ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135506" id2="17" version="1065353216">The SIS is a big agency. How did you end up working by yourself?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135506" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why did you work alone?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135507" id2="17" version="1065353216">You relied on Lana, and look what that got you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135507" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even after the torture?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135508" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's... not a bad point, but I was really thinking about you more than her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135510" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyway, thanks. Working with you has made all this madness worthwhile.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135511" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lana? Stay a moment. We should talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135511" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] Lana--don't leave yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135512" id2="17" version="1065353216">Since you can't trust anything I say, let's not waste the time, shall we?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135514" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can stay and talk a while!</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135524" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is quite a mess I've made, isn't it? &quot;The wicked Sith can't be trusted.&quot; Just the sentiment we need right now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135525" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's too much at stake to worry about people's feelings. You got us the information we need to stop Revan, that's all that matters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135525" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did what you had to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135526" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad you agree.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135527" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't be spending so much time around you if I couldn't stand a little bit of intrigue.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135527" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like things to be dangerous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135528" id2="17" version="1065353216">It wasn't the right call. But you did it for the mission, not yourself. That's got to count for something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1135528" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, you messed up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135529" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1135531" id2="17" version="1065353216">The moments we've shared--the connection between us--it's very important to me. I would never want to lose your trust.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140454" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've found a threat--and given us the means to root it out. Separately. What do we have to discuss?</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140460" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would rather not give him the opportunity to show us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140462" id2="17" version="1065353216">Every living thing in the entire galaxy? It doesn't seem possible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140463" id2="17" version="1065353216">The depths of the Emperor's power are as much a mystery to me as to you. But he is capable of it--I'm certain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140465" id2="17" version="1065353216">The ends have clearly justified the means. Personal feelings are irrelevant next to that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140467" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got exactly one professional spy in this group. I could have handled it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140469" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry you couldn't become a Jedi, Theron. You would have been a great one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1140469" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd have made a great Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140470" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe so. Can't complain about the alternatives, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140472" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's never too late to ditch the spy business and sign up for a real job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1140472" id2="17" version="1065353216">Should've been a soldier.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140473" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've borrowed a few uniforms over the years. Not my style.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140475" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you ever get tired of that government salary, give me a call.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1140475" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got room in my crew.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140476" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140478" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like to think they just couldn't keep up. The Director probably has a different opinion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1140480" id2="17" version="1065353216">Likewise. [Kiss him]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140482" id2="17" version="1065353216">The feeling is mutual.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140485" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad we're on the same page.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140487" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come on. Let's go see what Yavin has in store for us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140489" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're not done yet. Come on, let's get moving.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1140489" id2="17" version="1065353216">Speaking of work....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140490" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hm. Yeah, I guess we'd better. I'll see you on Yavin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140493" id2="17" version="1065353216">Makes sense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140495" id2="17" version="1065353216">But that won't matter in the long run, will it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140497" id2="17" version="1065353216">And there we are again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140499" id2="17" version="1065353216">But they are the priorities of a loyal Imperial.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140501" id2="17" version="1065353216">No matter how much you tried to teach me, I would never become anything other than a Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140503" id2="17" version="1065353216">I care because I want to save our Empire. Joining you would hardly achieve that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140506" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140509" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm... not yet. But time is not our ally. We should hurry along.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1140511" id2="17" version="1065353216">No sense in belaboring the point. Let's just move on with our mission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1142581" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess from now on, you'll think twice about visiting strange planets on the edge of the galaxy. Wouldn't want to go through all this again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1142582" id2="17" version="1065353216">That seems like so long ago.</text>
