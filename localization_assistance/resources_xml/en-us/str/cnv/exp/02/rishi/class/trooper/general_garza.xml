		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137788" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get to your mission. The Republic needs you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137790" id2="17" version="1065353216">Eclipse Squad has been neutralized. But you know that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137791" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, Major.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137793" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for cleaning up my mess. They deserved better, but so do you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137794" id2="17" version="1065353216">Before what happened... they must have been fine soldiers. I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137794" id2="17" version="1065353216">I bet they were a good team.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137795" id2="17" version="1065353216">So am I. For many reasons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137797" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can't walk away from this, Garza. I just killed six of the Republic's finest!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137797" id2="17" version="1065353216">There need to be consequences!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137799" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too many good people have died--Eclipse and everyone murdered at Fort Klemark.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137800" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're more right than you know. I could cover up Ando Prime, Tavus's defection, but not this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137802" id2="17" version="1065353216">You needed a covert ops team and you took a risk. If it had worked out, who knows what Eclipse could have done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137802" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one's at fault here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137804" id2="17" version="1065353216">You and I both know playing it safe gets people killed too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137805" id2="17" version="1065353216">You and I know that, but not everyone does.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137807" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't cover this one up--not like Ando Prime, or Commander Tavus's defection. The Senate won't ignore the incident at Fort Klemark.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137809" id2="17" version="1065353216">Eclipse Squad killed two hundred innocent people. The politicians will pounce. My SpecForce career is over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137810" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's time to stop hiding behind operational secrecy. You need to tell the truth--about SpecForce's full record.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137810" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come clean. About everything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137811" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one's hiding. I've shielded the Senate from the decisions they can't face. You should know that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137812" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you keep making the same choices, and people keep paying for them. There has to be accountability.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137813" id2="17" version="1065353216">Would you testify against me, Major?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137814" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I had to? Yes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137815" id2="17" version="1065353216">I see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137817" id2="17" version="1065353216">All the testimony in the world won't right my mistakes. I'll be stripped of my uniform; likely put in a comfortable prison.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137819" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I know better than to pit myself against you. When the Senate calls, I'll open the record.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137820" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't look at this as an end. This is a fresh start--a chance to make amends.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137820" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're doing the right thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137821" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've spent my life serving the Republic--a few years in a cell won't stop me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137823" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've had our differences, General, but Havoc and the Republic owe you a debt of gratitude. You helped make me who I am.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137823" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll always respect you, sir.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137824" id2="17" version="1065353216">Frankly, General--you deserve a lot worse than what you'll get from the Senate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137824" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope you do end up in jail.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137825" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've never understood. Maybe that's for the best--maybe so long as we have strong leaders, you won't have to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137827" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't get in your way, but I won't testify for you either. What happens next is up to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137827" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're on your own, Garza.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137828" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand, Major. Sometimes a soldier has to know when the battle is lost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137830" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't expect to see the inside of a cell, but I won't be wearing the uniform anymore. Still... I'll serve the Republic so long as I'm able.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137831" id2="17" version="1065353216">I imagine you'll find something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137832" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe Coruscant Security needs an anti-gang task force.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137834" id2="17" version="1065353216">What if there were a way to deflect some of the blame?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137834" id2="17" version="1065353216">Listen... I can cover it up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137835" id2="17" version="1065353216">Eclipse Squad was my team. There's no question what they did at Fort Klemark.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137836" id2="17" version="1065353216">But who knows why they did it? Especially since they came to Rishi afterward--a planet full of Revanites.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137837" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want to claim that Eclipse Squad was part of the cult?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137838" id2="17" version="1065353216">Like you said, Havoc's got prestige these days. If I report that Eclipse turned Revanite, the Senate will believe it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137839" id2="17" version="1065353216">It could be enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137841" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd still be out of SpecForce--two squads of defectors is one too many--but I have some pull with the SIS director.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137843" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd have to adjust to a new office, say goodbye to the uniform, but I'd be back to running ops within the year.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137844" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be sorry to see you go, sir. Havoc owes its success to you. The Republic owes you even more.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137844" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been a pleasure, General.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137845" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's enough, Major. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137847" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not everyone gets an opportunity like this. Don't let Eclipse Squad happen again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137847" id2="17" version="1065353216">Use your second chance well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137848" id2="17" version="1065353216">On my oath, I swear it won't.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137850" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those spies are in for a shock. They could use a little SpecForce training.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137850" id2="17" version="1065353216">The SIS needs some backbone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137851" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too bad there's only one Havoc--and one Havoc commander.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137853" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been a long flight to Rishi, and I do need to get back to Coruscant. It could be some time before we meet again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137854" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand. I've got my own mission to handle here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137855" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then get the job done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137857" id2="17" version="1065353216">I meant what I said before--you've outgrown me, and I am proud. It's been an honor serving with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137858" id2="17" version="1065353216">General.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137859" id2="17" version="1065353216">For the last time as your commander: Dismissed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137861" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good hunting, Major.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137862" id2="17" version="1065353216">Major. Perimeter report.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137863" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're clear, sir. No enemy contact or surveillance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137864" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good. What's the status of Havoc Squad?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137865" id2="17" version="1065353216">All troops equipped and combat ready.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137866" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm counting on that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137868" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you haven't disappointed me yet. I apologize for interrupting your operation--I don't doubt your objectives.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right now I just want an explanation. There's a lot happening, and I wasn't expecting you on Rishi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me what's going on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137870" id2="17" version="1065353216">You say &quot;jump&quot; and we say &quot;how high?&quot; No need to apologize, General.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137870" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your orders come first, sir.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137871" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's good having you here, Major.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137873" id2="17" version="1065353216">You haven't been in contact for months. You can't just pull me out of a top-priority mission without explaining.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137873" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is outrageous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137874" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have my reasons, Major. Do you care to hear them, or is this officially a mutiny?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137875" id2="17" version="1065353216">Talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137876" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137878" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's a story I need to tell you. It involves a Republic Special Forces team named &quot;Eclipse Squad.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137879" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137880" id2="17" version="1065353216">It started with the Rakton campaign. Your victory on Corellia was tremendous, and it's why I've been out of contact.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137882" id2="17" version="1065353216">After what happened, the Supreme Commander wanted you on top priority, front line missions only. You were too valuable--and too recognizable--for covert SpecForce work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137883" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was never the intent. You're saying Havoc was a victim of its own success?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137883" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not fair.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137884" id2="17" version="1065353216">With Havoc in the public eye and the war running hot, pushing us to the front made sense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137884" id2="17" version="1065353216">I assumed that was the case.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137885" id2="17" version="1065353216">What does any of that have to do with the &quot;Eclipse Squad&quot; you mentioned?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137885" id2="17" version="1065353216">Old news. Get to the point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137886" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everything, if you'll bother to listen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137888" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do not misunderstand. I was proud to see you and Havoc outgrow me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137890" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still, SpecForce needed a covert team, and no one could match your track record. I had to build a replacement.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137892" id2="17" version="1065353216">I tried every combination of species and technology, but couldn't hit the right formula--not until your operation on Manaan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137893" id2="17" version="1065353216">That operation was a secret.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137894" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have sources, Major. I sent a salvage team after you, and we dredged up the Revanites' Rakata technology.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137895" id2="17" version="1065353216">You rebuilt that tech and applied it to a SpecForce team. That's what Eclipse Squad is.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137895" id2="17" version="1065353216">You used those cybernetics.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137896" id2="17" version="1065353216">Very good. We took six volunteers and made them better soldiers. They were extraordinary, at first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137897" id2="17" version="1065353216">Until it went wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137898" id2="17" version="1065353216">What kind of &quot;sources&quot; told you what happened? Even the SIS was out of the loop.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137898" id2="17" version="1065353216">How could you possibly know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137899" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are still officially part of SpecForce. I know where your ship goes--I'd be negligent if I didn't.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137901" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've always been too eager to use experimental weapons, but Rakata cybernetics? What did you think would happen?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137901" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course it all went wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137902" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought we'd find a way to help win this war.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137904" id2="17" version="1065353216">My science team reconstructed whatever Rakata tech they could. What they couldn't, they patched with replacements from the inventor Krel's blueprints.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137906" id2="17" version="1065353216">We cybernetically augmented six volunteers. They were extraordinary--Eclipse Squad was an unequivocal triumph.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137907" id2="17" version="1065353216">Until it wasn't.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137908" id2="17" version="1065353216">There were... psychological effects. The team became paranoid. We thought it could be controlled.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137910" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then a fight broke out at Fort Klemark. The fort was destroyed and two hundred Republic soldiers killed. Eclipse went dark, and I've been tracking them ever since.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137911" id2="17" version="1065353216">Two hundred people. They must have thought Eclipse were heroes before they pulled the trigger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137911" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's terrible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137912" id2="17" version="1065353216">So they're a rogue SpecForce team. Why are they doing this? Why come to Rishi, of all places?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137912" id2="17" version="1065353216">What does Eclipse want?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137913" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those volunteers trusted you, and you as good as betrayed them when you pumped them full of alien tech.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137913" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've gone too far this time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137915" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now two hundred people have died? This has to stop--you have to stop.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137916" id2="17" version="1065353216">I made a mistake. We can discuss blame in-depth, or we can solve the problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137918" id2="17" version="1065353216">Eclipse is sick, Major. They believe they're serving the Republic--I think they're here investigating the Revanites--but they see everyone as the enemy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137920" id2="17" version="1065353216">Havoc is still the superior unit. Together we have to find them and stop them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137921" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll need all the intel you can provide and a way to locate Eclipse. They won't make it off Rishi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137921" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take care of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137922" id2="17" version="1065353216">If they're working as a team, investigating the Revanites, then they can still reason. We can talk to them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137922" id2="17" version="1065353216">They might still be savable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137923" id2="17" version="1065353216">They have programming now, not reason. You don't reason your way to mass murder.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137924" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe. What do you propose?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1137925" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like Eclipse is only a danger inside Republic lines. Out here, they might do some good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1137925" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why not let them continue?</text>
