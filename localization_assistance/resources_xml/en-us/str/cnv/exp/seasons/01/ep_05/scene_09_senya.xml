		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158161" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know. I couldn't help but take this place in, either. Reminds me of a song I wrote.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158168" id2="17" version="1065353216">I feel like I'm being watched.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1158168" id2="17" version="1065353216">This place is unsettling....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158169" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't have pegged you for a songwriter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1158169" id2="17" version="1065353216">You wrote a song? You?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158170" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd like to hear that. Just a few bars?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1158170" id2="17" version="1065353216">Care to sing it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158173" id2="17" version="1065353216">Without accompaniment? I'm not that brave.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158175" id2="17" version="1065353216">You seem nothing at all like the person I met in the swamp.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158177" id2="17" version="1065353216">Being a Knight means everything, but I don't let it define me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158179" id2="17" version="1065353216">When it's time to go to work, I'm who I need to be. The rest of the time, I'm just me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158181" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't strike me as all that different.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158182" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you mean?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1158182" id2="17" version="1065353216">How so?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158183" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm always me. It's as simple as that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1158183" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am who I am.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1158184" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not always a Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158185" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your Jedi Code. I've heard it recited. It's interesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1158187" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wouldn't work for me, I don't think. Definitely wouldn't work for Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160812" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad we could talk one to one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160815" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know, I get that a lot. Probably because most people meet me when I'm terse and angry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160816" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can stop looking at you. Maybe that will help? There.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160818" id2="17" version="1065353216">Better...? No? Worth a try.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160822" id2="17" version="1065353216">Parts of who you are have no place in war. They can't survive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160822" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160823" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think that's true, but it's hard to help sometimes. Someone like Arcann can make things unavoidably personal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160824" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;You're an outlaw.&quot; &quot;No, you're a vital asset in the war.&quot; &quot;No, now you're a pirate outlaw!&quot; Enough to make your head spin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160824" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's exhausting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160825" id2="17" version="1065353216">Think of it this way: you can be a &quot;vital pirate outlaw asset&quot; in the war against Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160826" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not always a Sith Lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160828" id2="17" version="1065353216">I live by a code, but I don't follow it to the letter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160829" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've heard your code. Victory from passion. It's a powerful notion. Very much like how Arcann operates.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160830" id2="17" version="1065353216">The things I have to do on the job stay on the job, if that's what you mean.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160830" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't let work get to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160831" id2="17" version="1065353216">Exactly. Though I think some things we can't help but be haunted by. Like having worked under Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160832" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever the situation requires of me, that's who I become.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160832" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've had many faces.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160833" id2="17" version="1065353216">I imagine that can get complicated. But it will make you useful against Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160834" id2="17" version="1065353216">I get the feeling you aren't entirely yourself when matters call for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160836" id2="17" version="1065353216">Like me, I think you send parts of yourself deep down when it's appropriate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160838" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think that's true of a lot of people. I like to think it's even true of Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160839" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think that's fine, but expect your sense of self to be tested if you confront Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160840" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know why I oppose him. What's your reason?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160841" id2="17" version="1065353216">Years after the death of our Immortal Emperor, most are still so afflicted with remorse that they don't see what's happening.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arcann has become oppressive and cruel. He'll crush anyone who doesn't share his plan for the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160845" id2="17" version="1065353216">So that's me. What about you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160846" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arcann wants to lay waste to everything I've fought for and accomplished. I won't let him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160846" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm trying to save the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160847" id2="17" version="1065353216">Neither will I. I may not know much of the worlds you've inhabited, but I do know what he's doing to them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160849" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everything I've done has brought me here. I'm supposed to face Arcann. To stop him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160849" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's my destiny.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160850" id2="17" version="1065353216">Careful with that. Destiny can cloud your judgment more than doubt ever could. Or rum.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160852" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arcann took five years of my life. Turned everything inside out. He has to pay.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160852" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want revenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160853" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know what that's like. Not exactly, but I see where you're coming from.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160857" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not what I expected. Not sure if that's good or bad yet, but I do know I'll have an easier time with you than Koth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160858" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope you'll try to get along. The more we work together, the better off we'll be.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160858" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please make an attempt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160859" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just because he betrayed our enemy doesn't change the fact that he was a traitor. You need to be cautious.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160860" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't trust either of you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160860" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're both strangers to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160861" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's fair. But I think you'll come to find one of us is more trustworthy than the other.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160862" id2="17" version="1065353216">If either of you makes this difficult for me, the Gravestone is equipped with several airlocks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1160862" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyone crosses me, they die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160863" id2="17" version="1065353216">When the time comes for us to confront Arcann, that might be just the kind of conviction we'll need.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160865" id2="17" version="1065353216">Valkorion lives. He is not himself, nor has he taken a new body. It is difficult to see...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160867" id2="17" version="1065353216">...and yet it is unmistakable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160869" id2="17" version="1065353216">His presence in the Force has always been deceptive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160871" id2="17" version="1065353216">Like on the Yavin moon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160873" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, and many times before and since.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1160875" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even when my life depended on it, I did not see him properly until it was too late....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176418" id2="17" version="1065353216">When it's time to go to work, I'm who I need to be. The rest of the time, I'm just myself.</text>
