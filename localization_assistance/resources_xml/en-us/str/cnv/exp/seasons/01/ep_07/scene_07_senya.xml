		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165000" id2="17" version="1065353216">A lot of firepower standing between us and their leader. They call him &quot;the Exalted&quot;.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165002" id2="17" version="1065353216">About time you got here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165003" id2="17" version="1065353216">Koth?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165004" id2="17" version="1065353216">Teeseven told me you were headed into Breaktown, figured the rest for myself. Didn't think there was a scenic route to get here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165006" id2="17" version="1065353216">What in Scyva's name are you doing here? Couldn't trust us to get the job done?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165008" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't stay ahead of you all of those years by trusting the wrong people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165010" id2="17" version="1065353216">No offense, Outlander. You, at least, I want to trust, so let me clue you in: the Exalted hates Knights. He won't say one word to Senya.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165012" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll make him talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165014" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look, I'm regular people. I speak their language. You want to make a deal with the Heralds, I'm your man.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165016" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're delusional thugs. There's no deal to be made.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165017" id2="17" version="1065353216">Koth, come on. Let's see what you can do. Senya, hang tight. We may still need you in there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1165017" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm taking Koth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165018" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's clear you two can't work together. Senya, you're with me. Koth, keep your ears open.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1165018" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm taking Senya.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165019" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're making a mistake....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165565" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arcann put him in charge here, but he's little more than a servant. And not a sane one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1165566" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, keep an eye out.</text>
