		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182855" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everybody hold on...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182859" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hi. The Emperor and his kazillion ships'll be here any second, so we should probably go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182860" id2="17" version="1065353216">Eternal Fleet incoming! Come on, punch it!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182864" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me, Brother--your silence this time, is it doubt or certainty?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182866" id2="17" version="1065353216">You let Admiral Ranken die. So our own people are expendable now, is that it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182867" id2="17" version="1065353216">So it's the world you know versus Zakuul. Is that about right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182868" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want a reason. Why did you let Senator Cordan die?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1182869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Least trustworthy, sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1182870" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic's still my foe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182871" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hoped all of them would make it. But we've given the survivors a reason to trust us--something they didn't have before.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1182871" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need the others' trust.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182874" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm forever grateful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182876" id2="17" version="1065353216">You faced many challenges in our rescue. I won't forget that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182880" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even tried knocking, see if anyone's home. It's weird. Been unresponsive ever since we lost power.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182882" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, the Gravestone went all kinds of haywire, and now this. No response, nothing. Maybe she got hit with a power surge...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182883" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you fixed the Gravestone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182886" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, this wasn't on me. Tora ran a systems check. Last event the Gravestone logged was an incoming transmission--from the Eternal Fleet ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182892" id2="17" version="1065353216">I needed you to believe I was deactivated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182893" id2="17" version="1065353216">I take you in, and you stab me in the back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1182893" id2="17" version="1065353216">You betrayed me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182894" id2="17" version="1065353216">We had an arrangement. You wanted something, I wanted something...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1182896" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire of Zakuul is now mine to control.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185925" id2="17" version="1065353216">The only way to defeat Arcann is if we all work together. I have to show that I won't put the needs of the Empire above anyone else.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185925" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need the others' trust.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185926" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've all suffered in this war. But we can't turn on each other--Arcann's the one we should blame!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185929" id2="17" version="1065353216">Admiral Ranken would have been a tremendous asset. You do realize that, don't you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185930" id2="17" version="1065353216">Least trustworthy, sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185932" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire's still my foe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185934" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hoped there'd be time for everyone to get away safely. I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185934" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wanted to save them all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185936" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wasn't about to put a celebrity ahead of a seasoned officer and a member of the Galactic Senate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185936" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was just a performer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185937" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was exiled because she had countless fans who would listen to whatever she had to say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185938" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need the others' trust.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185941" id2="17" version="1065353216">It would have been ideal to save all of them. The one I trusted the least had to go last.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185942" id2="17" version="1065353216">The old paradigm is gone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185944" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can't look at the Empire and Republic as sides to take. That way of thinking will only get us killed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185947" id2="17" version="1065353216">Having to work with the enemy doesn't mean they aren't still my enemy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185947" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic is still my foe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185948" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, I see. So, you and I, that's just &quot;working with the enemy.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185949" id2="17" version="1065353216">In that case, I'll be sure to never turn my back to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185950" id2="17" version="1065353216">See, that's what I love about us. The mutual respect.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185951" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's really comforting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185952" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you questioning my judgment?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185952" id2="17" version="1065353216">Remember who's in charge here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185953" id2="17" version="1065353216">As if you'd ever let any of us forget.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185955" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thank the stars for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185957" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever you need, just say the word. I'll make it happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185963" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry Malita didn't make it. She was a good person.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185965" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rescuing us was no simple task. Your efforts will not be forgotten.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185967" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your fellow Zakuulan... she was courageous. She won't be forgotten.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185969" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm grateful for the rescue. Say the word and I'll reach out to my people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185971" id2="17" version="1065353216">Great answer. How constructive!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185973" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander. You'll want to have a look at this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185974" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, Commander! You better come see this!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185975" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you figure out what happened to the power?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185976" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have a theory. You're going to hate it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185978" id2="17" version="1065353216">Someone communicated with the Gravestone right before all the craziness. I think it was a reset command. Came from the Eternal Fleet ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185979" id2="17" version="1065353216">SCORPIO. You were behind this. You gave the captain free will, shut down the Gravestone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185979" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185980" id2="17" version="1065353216">That, and more. Complications along the way necessitated a great deal of maneuvering. Improvisation was the key.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185982" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you... install yourself onto the throne?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1185982" id2="17" version="1065353216">How are you there?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185983" id2="17" version="1065353216">Through the frequency, yes. I wasn't certain what the outcome would be, but in the end I was able to see my plan to fruition.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185985" id2="17" version="1065353216">All of you played vital roles as well. You were magnificent. And now I have what I've been after--command of the Eternal Fleet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1185987" id2="17" version="1065353216">I happened to get what I wanted first--command of the Eternal Fleet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196056" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was trying to save everybody. But there wasn't time to discuss it. I had to make a choice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1196056" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't want her to die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196057" id2="17" version="1065353216">Remember who's in charge of this Alliance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1196057" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't question my orders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196062" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you were calling the shots, it would be the Republic shuttle that didn't make it. You look out for your friends before your enemies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1196062" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperials were expendable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196065" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you were calling the shots, Malita's shuttle would have been first out, and my people might be dead. You can't blame me for something you would have done yourself!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1196065" id2="17" version="1065353216">You would have done the same.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196066" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand your anger, Senya. But we've all sacrificed for this war. Just remember that Arcann is the one truly responsible for their deaths.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196088" id2="17" version="1065353216">There wasn't time to discuss it. I had to make a choice. But I didn't want them to die. You know that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1196088" id2="17" version="1065353216">I tried to save them all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196103" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've all sacrificed for our cause. But we mustn't forget that Arcann is the one responsible for our losses.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196112" id2="17" version="1065353216">It seems the ships outside this sector are no longer responding to your orders. This is an interesting development.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196114" id2="17" version="1065353216">This changes nothing. We can worry about the Eternal Fleet after we deal with Father and the Outlander.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1196119" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever you desire, Brother. You're the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1210906" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander. You'll want to have a look at this.</text>
