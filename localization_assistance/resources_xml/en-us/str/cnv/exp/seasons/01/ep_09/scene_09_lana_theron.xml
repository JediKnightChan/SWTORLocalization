		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168936" id2="17" version="1065353216">What is all this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168937" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's your first official speech as Alliance Commander.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168938" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll have to thank everyone for their vote of confidence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1168938" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm honored.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168939" id2="17" version="1065353216">Enough standing around. Let's get this underway.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1168939" id2="17" version="1065353216">About time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168940" id2="17" version="1065353216">When was that decided without my having any say whatsoever?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1168940" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't agree to that role.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168941" id2="17" version="1065353216">There was no vote. No meetings, no debates. It's simply the way it is. The way it has been since the day you arrived.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168943" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everyone knows it. It's just... official now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168945" id2="17" version="1065353216">So I've been promoted from Commander to....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168946" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you hated titles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168947" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hate having one, but I do love granting them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168949" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're looking to you to guide them to greatness as only you can. Take them there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168950" id2="17" version="1065353216">You began with nothing. Now you stand inside the base you have built. The Alliance grows stronger every day. You have done well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1168950" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Give an oppressive speech]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168952" id2="17" version="1065353216">All of us here, we know about loss, don't we? We've lost loved ones, friends. We've been beaten down time and again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1168952" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Give an inspiring speech]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168954" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our lives have been taken from us. It almost feels like our destiny. But not one of you has given up. You've stuck it out through your losses.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168956" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've come together to build, to create, to fight--and I appreciate each and every one of you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168958" id2="17" version="1065353216">Working together, the galaxy won't have to live under the threat of a tyrant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168960" id2="17" version="1065353216">Together, we will remove Arcann from the throne and we will prevail!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168963" id2="17" version="1065353216">They have come so far.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168965" id2="17" version="1065353216">Indeed, they have.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168967" id2="17" version="1065353216">They still have far to go, but at this rate they could one day pose a challenge to the Eternal Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1168969" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps. A pity so many of them will have to die....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1169306" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was never decided.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1169308" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, you have. Congratulations, Commander.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1169312" id2="17" version="1065353216">But make no mistake--your work has just begun. It's time to redouble your efforts. To sacrifice, and do as your superiors tell you without question.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1169314" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you grow tired, when you wish it would all end, I want you to think about the madman out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1169316" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arcann remains a threat to everything you have ever held dear.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1169318" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arcann is your enemy. Destroy him... or be destroyed.</text>
