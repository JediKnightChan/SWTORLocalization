		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164756" id2="17" version="1065353216">--a love the hand of Tyth could not deny....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164757" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're headed back into the heart of Arcann's empire, and you're singing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164758" id2="17" version="1065353216">What better time?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164760" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyway, where we're going, no one will be looking for criminals. Most of the people there are criminals. Which, of course, presents its own dangers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164762" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even so, I do enjoy visiting the Old World. It's a piece of Zakuul history. Valkorion's first attempt at creating a grand society.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164763" id2="17" version="1065353216">A failed attempt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164764" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only in scale. To him, it wasn't nearly grand enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164766" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hello, little one.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1164768" id2="17" version="1065353216">You = welcome // T7 = ready to assist with mission!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164769" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gotten yourself into any trouble while I was gone?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164769" id2="17" version="1065353216">How are you, pal?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1164770" id2="17" version="1065353216">Trouble = everywhere // T7 = good at blending in</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164772" id2="17" version="1065353216">Teeseven, what do you have for us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164772" id2="17" version="1065353216">Find out anything new?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1164773" id2="17" version="1065353216">New data = unavailable // T7 = searching extensively</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164775" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't suppose you have any news about Doc or Kira or anyone?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164775" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any word from our friends?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1164776" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ally status updates = nonexistent // All searches = inconclusive // T7 = never giving up hope</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164778" id2="17" version="1065353216">Seems like you're everywhere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164778" id2="17" version="1065353216">You really get around.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1164779" id2="17" version="1065353216">All = see T7 as harmless // T7 = able to go almost anywhere</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164781" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want updates, not chatter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164781" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get to the status report.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1164782" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lady of Sorrows = difficult to locate // Operations base = undetermined</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164784" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Lady of Sorrows is wanted for murder and theft of state secrets, among other charges. The Knights have hunted her for years. No one's come close.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164785" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look who you're talking to. I'll get her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164785" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hunting is what I do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164786" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, I've heard you were quite the mercenary.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164788" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll find her--as a team.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164790" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll find her--as a team.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164792" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure the three of us will manage if we work together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164793" id2="17" version="1065353216">They aren't me. I'll find her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164793" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm better than your Knights.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164794" id2="17" version="1065353216">With my help, I don't doubt it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164796" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who has she murdered?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1164796" id2="17" version="1065353216">Murder?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164797" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, just anyone who's managed to get in her way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164799" id2="17" version="1065353216">You may not believe this, but it's rare for someone to escape a Knight's justice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164800" id2="17" version="1065353216">And when that someone is the Knight's own child?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164801" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll find out, won't we?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164803" id2="17" version="1065353216">Could I...? Is it possible for me to talk to him? To Valkorion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164804" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't think it works that way, exactly....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1164807" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lots of things live down here. Few of them friendly. We should be careful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176862" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want to know more about your relationship with Valkorion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176862" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about you and Valkorion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176865" id2="17" version="1065353216">The story really isn't as outlandish as whatever you're imagining.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176867" id2="17" version="1065353216">We met after I earned a place in his elite guard. I never hesitated to speak my mind, which... caught his attention, I suppose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176869" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was fascinating. Bold. Always completely certain of his next step.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176870" id2="17" version="1065353216">The way you describe him, I can't blame you for taking an interest.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176870" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can understand that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176871" id2="17" version="1065353216">You also have to understand his place in our culture, our psychology... our entire conception of ourselves. He guided Zakuul's prosperity for generations. Centuries.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176872" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I were describing you, I'd say the same things.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176872" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] Just like you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176873" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're flattering me. But, yes, somehow we had a fair bit in common.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176876" id2="17" version="1065353216">Every &quot;next step&quot; he took was for his own gain. How did you not see that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176876" id2="17" version="1065353216">So he was smug and ruthless.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176877" id2="17" version="1065353216">Like I said earlier... the man I knew was different. He did nothing but improve his people's lives.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176879" id2="17" version="1065353216">What we had wasn't a child's notion of romance, but... we were happy. Then the twins came.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176881" id2="17" version="1065353216">I loved Arcann and Thexen, but no matter what I did... they wanted nothing to do with me. And Valkorion wanted nothing to do with them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176883" id2="17" version="1065353216">His mind was somewhere else. He barely spoke, barely acknowledged any of us for weeks at a time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176885" id2="17" version="1065353216">And then Vaylin... Vaylin was troubled from the start.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176886" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was she really dangerous even as a child?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176886" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was that bad?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176887" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know this is hard for you. We don't have to keep talking about it if you'd rather not.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176887" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't have to discuss this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176888" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd have to start young to end up as crazy as she is.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176888" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hardly surprising.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176889" id2="17" version="1065353216">She made furniture move while she was still in the womb. Tore droids apart as a toddler. Once, a guard dropped a ball she tossed. Vaylin crippled him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176891" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've kept it in for twenty years, and I wouldn't say it helped. We'll see if letting it out works any differently.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176893" id2="17" version="1065353216">The boys were always aggressive, but they understood restraint and boundaries. Not Vaylin. She was a danger to everyone around her, even as a child.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176895" id2="17" version="1065353216">I confronted Valkorion. His daughter needed help. His sons needed him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176897" id2="17" version="1065353216">His &quot;solution&quot; was to cage Vaylin's mind. Most of her power was locked her away, along with most of who she was. He ignored the rest of us outright.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176899" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't stand by and watch. I gathered the children. I tried to tell them we needed to go. They laughed and called me weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176901" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even as children--even with Vaylin's power restrained--the three of them together were still far more powerful than me. I couldn't force them to go. So... I left.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176902" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't imagine how hard that must have been for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176902" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm so sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176903" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did Valkorion try to stop you from leaving?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176903" id2="17" version="1065353216">What did Valkorion do?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176904" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were the only one who wanted to help those children, and you ran away. Now look at them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176904" id2="17" version="1065353216">Coward.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176905" id2="17" version="1065353216">Better than being trapped there, helpless.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176907" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. I'm not sure he even noticed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176911" id2="17" version="1065353216">There was nothing I could do for them. I couldn't stay there and watch, helpless.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176913" id2="17" version="1065353216">I transferred to the Knights' enforcement division and took assignments at the outer fringes of our empire. Valkorion never spoke another word to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176918" id2="17" version="1065353216">Since then, I've only ever seen my children in broadcasts. I don't even know if they remember me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176923" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come on--we should keep moving.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176923" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's keep moving.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1184158" id2="17" version="1065353216">What we had wasn't a child's notion of romance, but... we were happy. Then Arcann and his brother, Thexan, were born.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1184160" id2="17" version="1065353216">I loved them so much, but no matter what I did... they wanted nothing to do with me. And Valkorion wanted nothing to do with them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1184162" id2="17" version="1065353216">Since then, I've only seen my children in broadcasts of public events... like Thexan's funeral. Killed in the Core Worlds... I doubt they even remember me.</text>
