		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162106" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's destiny. I ditch all of these parts before we crash, we find the Gravestone, and then what do we need to get it flying? Honestly, it's plain as day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162108" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not for Lana, though. For her, it's all just skill and luck and coincidence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162110" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you don't need to hear it from me, right? You two were saving the galaxy together before I even met her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162111" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are we still talking about destiny, or is this about me and Lana?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162112" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you'd heard stories like the ones I've heard, you'd be curious, too. Now I can finally hear it straight from the source.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162113" id2="17" version="1065353216">What Lana and I had was special... but circumstances kept getting in the way. I'm hoping this is our chance to finally be together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162113" id2="17" version="1065353216">We were lovers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162114" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's what I figured.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162115" id2="17" version="1065353216">We were allies through a dangerous time. I like to believe that we were even friends, and still are. But that's all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162115" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're just friends.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162116" id2="17" version="1065353216">Interesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162117" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm much more interested in hearing about you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162117" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] Why not talk about us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162118" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh... uh... actually, that's probably a good idea.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162120" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's something you need to know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162122" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not here to tell you stories. I don't even know you. Just do your job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162122" id2="17" version="1065353216">Less talk, more work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162123" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not good enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162125" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look... there's something you should know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162127" id2="17" version="1065353216">I grew up on Zakuul, served in the military. I captained a warship during Arcann's campaign against the Core Worlds, one of the last ships without an all-droid crew.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162129" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lana might have told you I was the captain of a warship during Arcann's campaign against the Core Worlds.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162131" id2="17" version="1065353216">My crew and I deserted, but I'm not going to pretend we didn't do our share of damage beforehand. Just... thought you should hear it from me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162132" id2="17" version="1065353216">Something must have happened to make you desert your post. What was it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162133" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lana mentioned that you deserted instead of following orders... what was the order?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162134" id2="17" version="1065353216">We were holding territory on Denon. Locals rioted, and orders were to open fire until they stopped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162136" id2="17" version="1065353216">None of us even wanted to be there... massacring civilians? That's not how Zakuul is supposed to operate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162137" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for being honest with me. You and your crew made the right choice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162137" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did the right thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162138" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad you think so.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162140" id2="17" version="1065353216">Deserting doesn't undo what you did. Make one wrong move and I'll end you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162140" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be watching you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162141" id2="17" version="1065353216">So glad I could be honest with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162143" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess that's how Arcann operates.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162143" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arcann doesn't have any rules.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162144" id2="17" version="1065353216">Which is why he has to go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162146" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come on, let's get this stuff back to the Gravestone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162148" id2="17" version="1065353216">Salutation: It is a pleasure to see you again so soon, masters. I have encountered minimal resistance in my patrol.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162150" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Minimal&quot;?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162152" id2="17" version="1065353216">Reassurance: Only one Skytrooper and three local predators with poor survival instincts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162154" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our position appears to be secure at this time, but I would still advise caution on your return trip, masters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162155" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep up the good work, HK.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162155" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162156" id2="17" version="1065353216">Appreciation: It will be my pleasure to do so, master!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162157" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you've already spotted enemy scouts, more are bound to be coming. Keep patrolling.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1162157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get back to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162158" id2="17" version="1065353216">Reassurance: I will annihilate any potential threat that approaches the Gravestone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162163" id2="17" version="1065353216">Request: Please rendezvous at my current coordinates at your earliest convenience, masters. I require assistance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1162165" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blasted droid....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Relying on fate to get you out of trouble will always leave you disappointed. Better to rely on yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176228" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176229" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm with you. Things always end up going my way--there's really no other explanation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176229" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm on your side in this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176230" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't come out here to philosophize. I just want to get off this planet, the sooner the better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176230" id2="17" version="1065353216">I really don't care.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176231" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't believe you two. Just wait and see--I know I'm right on this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176233" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's hope that includes taking down Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176235" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can't disagree with that too much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176237" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lana's told me about all the things you've done. More than once. Half the reason I agreed to this crazy rescue was to see if you were actually real.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176239" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, I figure I know all about your past--you deserve to know mine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176244" id2="17" version="1065353216">One more thing--as long as we're being honest.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176246" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you risked your life to shut that generator down, you showed me that you're someone I can count on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176248" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want to take Arcann down, but we don't have to take down all of Zakuul with him. I'm glad to know you understand that, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176249" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too many innocent people have suffered already. I'm not going to add to that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176249" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176250" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm hoping that's not the only thing we have in common.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176250" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] Nice to be appreciated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176251" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a nice sentiment, and this time things worked out. But when it comes down to it, I'm not going to let anything stop me from beating Arcann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176251" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't get your hopes up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176252" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess we'll find out, huh?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176254" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know things were hairy back there, but a lot of innocent people died. A lot. That's not what I signed up for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176256" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm in this to save Zakuul from Arcann, not to tear it down with him. I need to know you're on board with that, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176257" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're absolutely right. I won't let any more innocent people suffer because of Arcann and Vaylin--no matter where they're from.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176257" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176258" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want to help your people--I admire that. I won't let anything more happen to them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176258" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] You're a good man.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176259" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm in this to win. No matter what the cost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1176259" id2="17" version="1065353216">Victory is worth any cost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176260" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then sooner or later, we're going to have a problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1176261" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
