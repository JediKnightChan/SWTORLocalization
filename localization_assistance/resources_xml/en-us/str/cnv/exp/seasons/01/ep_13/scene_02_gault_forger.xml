		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189625" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, this plan I mentioned. It's going to take the best identity forger this side of the galaxy to pull off.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189627" id2="17" version="1065353216">Problem is, he's been in hiding--specifically in that--for a long time. He probably won't be too thrilled to have visitors.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189629" id2="17" version="1065353216">Especially not visitors who had his safehouse shipped a few thousand parsecs unannounced. Be on your toes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189630" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you kidnapped him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1189630" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unannounced?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189631" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's more a change of address.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189633" id2="17" version="1065353216">What makes you think he'll cooperate?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1189633" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not reassuring.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189634" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, he'll come around.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189636" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think I can handle a grimy hermit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1189636" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not worried.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189637" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just don't kill him, or the only thing getting washed is the plan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189641" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dretcher, is it? They always say retirement's a good time to travel. Why don't you come and check out the new scenery?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189643" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tyresius. You've got a lot of nerve showing your ugly mug to me again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189644" id2="17" version="1065353216">Another partner you burned?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189645" id2="17" version="1065353216">This one was asking for it, and we were never partners.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189647" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tyresius?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189648" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just a name I carried around for a while, no use to anybody now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189650" id2="17" version="1065353216">Think you've got me confused for someone else, friend. Name's Gault Rennow, got a business proposition I think you'll want to hear about.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189652" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can't play dumb with me, Ty. I know that face better than you do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189653" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's the guy that made your duplicate, isn't he?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1189653" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is about your double.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189654" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the one, so you know I wasn't kidding when I said he's the best.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189656" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you mean?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1189656" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know his face?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189657" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's seen a lot of my work. I even made him a perfect duplicate... better than perfect. My version didn't talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189659" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gault tells me you're the best identity forger in the business. We could use you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1189659" id2="17" version="1065353216">He speaks highly of you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189660" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've had enough of helping that fraud fake his own death. This time it's going to stick.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189662" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care what kind of past you two share. We've got business to get to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1189662" id2="17" version="1065353216">Enough bickering.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189663" id2="17" version="1065353216">The only thing I've got to get to is finally enjoying my retirement.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189665" id2="17" version="1065353216">A little gift for your hospitality. You can mail order just about anything these days.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189669" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is the place. Ah, that container, over there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189672" id2="17" version="1065353216">There she is: Vandin. Mind the ledges when you're walking around, unless you fancy a death by scenic view.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189675" id2="17" version="1065353216">You haven't mentioned why we're here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189676" id2="17" version="1065353216">Giant barge. Full of money. Is this ringing any bells? It's out there somewhere, swimming below sight and scan range.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189678" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's enough magnetism in this place to rival my own. Would have been quite the headache for Mako, I'm sure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189680" id2="17" version="1065353216">Something about the magnetism here plays havoc with sensors, and cheap fillings.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189682" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bottom line is: we'll never find the Gilded Star out there, which is all the more reason to get our preparations underway.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189684" id2="17" version="1065353216">Such as picking up the last member of our illustrious crew.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189688" id2="17" version="1065353216">How many people are we going to need?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1189688" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're still recruiting?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189689" id2="17" version="1065353216">Half a dozen, give or take? This is the last one unaccounted for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189692" id2="17" version="1065353216">He should be in a warehouse not far from the dock yards. I'll point out the place when I see it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1189694" id2="17" version="1065353216">Vandin. If you need coordinates, just check with Hylo.</text>
