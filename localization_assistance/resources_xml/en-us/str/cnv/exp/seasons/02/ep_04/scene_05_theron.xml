		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207891" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can't be too careful in this neighborhood. The others are here, safe and sound.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207892" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a relief. I hope one of them brought the Gravestone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207892" id2="17" version="1065353216">All we need now is our ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207893" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everyone's on foot. Whatever put us here didn't want us too mobile.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207895" id2="17" version="1065353216">The last time I saw Vette, Vaylin was about to kill her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207895" id2="17" version="1065353216">How is Vette?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207896" id2="17" version="1065353216">It shook her up, but Vette's tough. Already focused on getting us home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207898" id2="17" version="1065353216">Vaylin's forces may know where to find their Empress. Bring me people to interrogate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207898" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need more information.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207899" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll do what we can. You know what it's like out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207901" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm scanning for our ship, but so far nothing. The Gravestone could be anywhere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207902" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep looking. SCORPIO said our vessel was built on Iokath.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207902" id2="17" version="1065353216">It came from this world.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207903" id2="17" version="1065353216">You saw how huge this planet is from orbit. My scans can only extend so far.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207905" id2="17" version="1065353216">If this is our base of operations, we need to know it's absolutely safe. What have you learned?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207905" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about this place.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207906" id2="17" version="1065353216">It feels like some kind of monument. To what, I don't know--but we're the only ones here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207908" id2="17" version="1065353216">We won't need the Gravestone. We can kill Vaylin without it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207908" id2="17" version="1065353216">All I want is Vaylin's head.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207909" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd rather hit her with the Omnicannon. More satisfying. Safer, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207913" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's the traitor doing here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207915" id2="17" version="1065353216">He picked up my holo-signal to the others and I let him in, against my better judgment. Told him if he moves, he's dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207917" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I told you, I came to help. Come on, Commander. I want off this rock as much as you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207918" id2="17" version="1065353216">The past is done. We need to focus on the present. I'll take all the help I can get.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207918" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're all in this together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207919" id2="17" version="1065353216">You heard the Commander. Start by helping secure this entrance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207921" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've &quot;helped&quot; enough, Koth. You had your chance to be a hero.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207921" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't want your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207922" id2="17" version="1065353216">The only reason you're here is so you won't cause more trouble out there. Don't push it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207925" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need to secure this entrance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207927" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can help with that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207929" id2="17" version="1065353216">Vette's in the main room, poking at one of those monuments. She's onto something that could help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208199" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry you were on your own for so long. I got here as fast as I could.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208199" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's good to see you, my love.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208200" id2="17" version="1065353216">People keep trying to break us up. They never learn.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208434" id2="17" version="1065353216">I ran a medical scan when she arrived. She's fine. Excited to see you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1213914" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I told you, I came to help. Come on, Commander. I want off this hunk of metal as much as you.</text>
