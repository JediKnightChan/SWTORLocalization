		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1214685" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never believed you were really dead, Commander. Not even for a second. Can't con a con artist, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1214690" id2="17" version="1065353216">By the way... if anyone contacts you asking about a life insurance policy that paid out in your name, just say you don't know me, okay?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1214694" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good to see you back in one piece, Commander. Don't know what the Alliance would do without you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1214695" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I heard the rumors you were gone... the thought of losing you...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1214697" id2="17" version="1065353216">Seeing you standing here, alive and well... I can't believe I almost fell for Saresh's lies. Welcome home, Commander.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1214698" id2="17" version="1065353216">You disappeared five years ago, and I thought you were dead. I gave up on you then. This time, I knew better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1214701" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know better than to doubt you. But for a moment I felt... no. You're alive. That's all that matters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1214706" id2="17" version="1065353216">The rumors, the official reports... none of that mattered. I knew you'd come back to me.</text>
