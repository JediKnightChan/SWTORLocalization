		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1204600" id2="17" version="1065353216">The beasts ripped a young man apart. He died screaming in front of Vaylin, but she made no move to help. Things are progressing well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1204601" id2="17" version="1065353216">The methods they used to control her were harsh, but they worked.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1204601" id2="17" version="1065353216">Brutal but effective.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1204602" id2="17" version="1065353216">Interesting. They wanted to curb her power without creating an aversion to horrific violence.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1205139" id2="17" version="1065353216">With all the experiments they did on her, I'm surprised she would ever set foot on Nathema again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1205139" id2="17" version="1065353216">Vaylin must hate this place.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1205143" id2="17" version="1065353216">I imagine she would do anything to break free from Valkorion's mental conditioning.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1211843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Or he simply awoke her inner monster.</text>
