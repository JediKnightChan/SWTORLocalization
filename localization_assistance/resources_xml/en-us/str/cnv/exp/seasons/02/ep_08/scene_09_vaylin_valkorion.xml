		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207066" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. Father did this! A trick! It has to be.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207067" id2="17" version="1065353216">This has nothing to do with Valkorion. You brought it on yourself when you attacked my people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207067" id2="17" version="1065353216">You caused this, not him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207068" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can't be foolish enough to believe that. Father drove you to this. You've been his puppet all along.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207072" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've made no secret of my goal. Neither you nor Arcann were worthy of my legacy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207074" id2="17" version="1065353216">He turned on his family, Outlander. His own flesh and blood. It's only a matter of time before he betrays you, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207078" id2="17" version="1065353216">This isn't over. Even now, my daughter is a threat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207080" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, Father. You know me so well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207086" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're losing altitude!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207088" id2="17" version="1065353216">Something's dragging us down to the surface... along with every other ship in orbit!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207104" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have no more power over Vaylin. Only you are strong enough to stop this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207106" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Eternal Throne is mine!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207107" id2="17" version="1065353216">This isn't about the throne. It's about stopping you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207107" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never wanted it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207112" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Eternal Fleet just retreated. Every single ship... gone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207114" id2="17" version="1065353216">Enemy lines have broken! It's a rout! They're surrendering by the thousands!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207116" id2="17" version="1065353216">My sister's rage was the only thing giving her troops the will to fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207118" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then it's over. We've won.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207121" id2="17" version="1065353216">We won.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207124" id2="17" version="1065353216">I still can't believe Vette's gone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207125" id2="17" version="1065353216">She sacrificed herself for the sake of others. Taking out the enemy artillery guns saved countless lives.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207125" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was a true hero.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207126" id2="17" version="1065353216">We will honor her memory... along with everyone who fell defending Odessen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207128" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander. Urgent distress call coming in from Empress Acina.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207130" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dromund Kaas is under attack. The Eternal Fleet is bombing us from orbit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207140" id2="17" version="1065353216">We won't abandon an ally. I'm sending our fleet, Empress--with the Gravestone at its head.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207141" id2="17" version="1065353216">This reaches far beyond the borders of the Sith Empire. The Republic is also under attack.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207143" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm picking up urgent distress signals from Coruscant and the other Core Worlds.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207145" id2="17" version="1065353216">We know Vaylin didn't order this. The GEMINI captains must have gone rogue.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207147" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's more. Emergency calls coming in from Zakuul. The Eternal Fleet set up a blockade. They're bombing them into oblivion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207148" id2="17" version="1065353216">Valkorion, what did you do?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1207148" id2="17" version="1065353216">Valkorion's behind this!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207149" id2="17" version="1065353216">You caused this, not I.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207151" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Eternal Throne sits empty. Leaderless, the fleet has reverted to its most primal function: extermination.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207153" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unchecked, they will destroy all life in the galaxy. There is only one way to stop them. Claim the Eternal Throne and seize your destiny.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1207154" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ready the Gravestone. We're going to Zakuul.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208106" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm stronger than you, Vaylin. Admit it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208106" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's no trick. I beat you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208107" id2="17" version="1065353216">Throw down your weapons. This doesn't have to end with your death.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208107" id2="17" version="1065353216">Surrender and live.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208108" id2="17" version="1065353216">Valkorion gave you a piece of his power. Why?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208109" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you really think Valkorion will let me live? And you, just a pawn.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208110" id2="17" version="1065353216">The throne needs a strong ruler. Someone like me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208110" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can't stop me!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208114" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're losing altitude!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208117" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget the throne. Forget everything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208117" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's over, Vaylin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208119" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Eternal Fleet just turned tail and ran! The whole fleet!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208121" id2="17" version="1065353216">Without Vaylin to drive them, her troops have no will to fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208123" id2="17" version="1065353216">We did it. We won.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208126" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not yet. This doesn't end until I'm sitting on the Eternal Throne.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208130" id2="17" version="1065353216">We lost many lives defending Odessen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208130" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's not the only one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208131" id2="17" version="1065353216">And they all gave their lives for you. The least we can do is honor their memories.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208133" id2="17" version="1065353216">I still can't believe Torian's gone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208134" id2="17" version="1065353216">If she was stronger, she'd still be alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208134" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208135" id2="17" version="1065353216">Turn your back on everyone weaker than you, eventually you stand alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208136" id2="17" version="1065353216">He sacrificed himself so our cause could live on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208136" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was a true hero.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208137" id2="17" version="1065353216">We will honor his memory... along with everyone who fell defending Odessen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208138" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was a soldier. Soldiers die during war.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208138" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was his duty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208139" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can still honor his memory. It's the least we can do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208140" id2="17" version="1065353216">If he was stronger, he'd still be alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208140" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208141" id2="17" version="1065353216">I rejected your offer to join forces, remember? Deal with them yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208148" id2="17" version="1065353216">None of this affects us. Let the Eternal Fleet wipe out our enemies, then we clean up the mess.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208148" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good. Let them burn.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208149" id2="17" version="1065353216">You cannot ignore this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208151" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't sit by while the Eternal Fleet wipes out billions of lives!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1208151" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have to help them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1208152" id2="17" version="1065353216">You cannot solve this with your armies and fleets.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209087" id2="17" version="1065353216">She'll bring the entire base crashing down on us!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209089" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's tearing the entire base apart!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209119" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need to talk about Vaylin's death. Her lifeforce flowed into you when you struck her down. Just like Arcann's.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209120" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need to talk about my sister's death. I felt something when you struck her down. Like her lifeforce flowed into you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209121" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've consumed many spirits over the years. This felt no different.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209122" id2="17" version="1065353216">This happened once before... when Valkorion died.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209123" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unlike my father, Vaylin didn't have the power to transfer her spirit to a new host.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209124" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe you're right. Unlike my father, Vaylin didn't have the power to transfer her spirit from host to host.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209127" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's possible you simply absorbed her strength, while her spirit was obliterated. I hope that's all it was.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209128" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Vaylin was alive, I think I would sense her--like Valkorion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1209128" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't sense her presence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209129" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you saying Vaylin's not really dead? Or do you think Valkorion is up to something?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1209129" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think this is a trick?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209130" id2="17" version="1065353216">Vaylin's spirit could be destroyed, trapped, or wandering Odessen. It makes no difference to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1209130" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care about her fate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209131" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not if Father is preventing it. I have no proof, but we both know he can't be trusted. Be careful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209132" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know. Something strange happened, and we both know my father can't be trusted. Be careful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209133" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't ignore what happened. I have no proof, but I'm afraid Valkorion may be up to something. Be careful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209134" id2="17" version="1065353216">Valkorion's been pushing me to destroy his children. You think he's up to something?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1209134" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think this is a trick?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209135" id2="17" version="1065353216">Valkorion's children were both powerful, angry, and violent. Their spirits wouldn't just fade peacefully away when they die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1209135" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not surprising.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209136" id2="17" version="1065353216">Vaylin was weak. She didn't deserve her power, so I took it. That's all that matters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1209136" id2="17" version="1065353216">I consumed her strength.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209137" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps, but I don't trust Valkorion. I fear he's still plotting... something. Be careful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209138" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not them I'm worried about. We both know Valkorion can't be trusted. He's up to something. Be prepared.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209139" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's always up to something. I have no proof. Only suspicions. But you know he can't be trusted. Watch your back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209140" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not just the Sith who are under attack, Commander!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1209142" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Vaylin was still alive inside me somehow, wouldn't I notice?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1209142" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't feel any different.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1213907" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're dealing with our own crisis, Acina. You're on your own.</text>
