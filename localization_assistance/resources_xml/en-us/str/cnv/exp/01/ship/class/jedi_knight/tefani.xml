		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068882" id2="17" version="1065353216">Boy, this is some ship the Jedi got you. Makes me wish I had the Force. Except for the &quot;no emotions&quot; thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068884" id2="17" version="1065353216">I checked out the engine--she was running a little hot, so I made some adjustments. Hope you don't mind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068885" id2="17" version="1065353216">This ship has served me well. I'd like to keep it in top condition, if you're willing to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1068885" id2="17" version="1065353216">I appreciate any assistance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068886" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad to hear it. I've got a bad habit of doing without asking.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068888" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have you always been this handy with machines?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1068888" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're quite a tinkerer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068889" id2="17" version="1065353216">Since I was a tyke. It's just neat, knowing how everything works.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068891" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep your hands to yourself. You're not part of my crew.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1068891" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't do it again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068892" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll put her back the way she was, but don't come crying when she shorts out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068894" id2="17" version="1065353216">If it runs, guzzles or hums, I can't help taking it apart. Used to drive my wife crazy. Still does, when I'm home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068896" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once, during shore leave, I tried to convert our freezer into a tankless water heater. Was she mad!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068897" id2="17" version="1065353216">It must be difficult, being away from the people you love.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1068897" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you miss her?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068898" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't think about it. That's the trick. Especially when you're alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068900" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't know you had a wife. How long have you been together?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1068900" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're married?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068901" id2="17" version="1065353216">Since before the Protectors. Used to do maintenance at a swoop track, and she sold snacks to the crowd.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1068903" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd be mad, too!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068905" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Doc did anything like that, he'd be sleeping on the floor for a week.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068906" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, he knows. We've traded a few war stories already.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068909" id2="17" version="1065353216">She never sees you, and when you are home, you break her things?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068910" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have you two met? Because that is a dead-on impression.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1068912" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wives are nothing but trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068914" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least she doesn't have the Force. Try living with that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068915" id2="17" version="1065353216">No thanks. I'd rather observe and pity you from afar.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068918" id2="17" version="1065353216">Marriage is a dead end. No one's going to tie me down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068919" id2="17" version="1065353216">Meet the right person, and they might change your mind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068921" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's hard sometimes, being away from her. But even she says I've got a gift. And I'm a good engineer, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068923" id2="17" version="1065353216">You get it? Because she... well, your medic liked it. Good talking to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1068925" id2="17" version="1065353216">Listen. That's the sound of a perfectly optimized hyperdrive. I love this ship.</text>
