		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1019071" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll get word to Tad and Samsin--let them know the stand-off has ended.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1019073" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why it had to end like this, I don't know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020761" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll spend my life in a Republic lockup...long as I get to see my family....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020764" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arrin!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020766" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get back... stay with the hostages, you can slip away....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020768" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's over, don't you see that? You can't even move. Someone, please, help him!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020769" id2="17" version="1065353216">Some of you are medics, aren't you? Do what you can for him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020769" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Protectors will help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020770" id2="17" version="1065353216">That should help with the pain, but he needs immediate medical attention.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020770" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll do what I can.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020771" id2="17" version="1065353216">Standard-issue first-aid kit. Might help with the pain, but not much else.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020771" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here's a medpac.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020772" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyone here know their way around a blaster wound?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020772" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, I'm no doctor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020773" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm on it. Good thing he didn't torch our supplies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020775" id2="17" version="1065353216">This man held you hostage for days. Now you're worried he's going to die?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020775" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's going on here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020776" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not a hostage, I'm his wife.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020778" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unless you want to die with him, back away slowly and don't move again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020778" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get out of my way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020779" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know what he did was wrong, but he was just trying to save us. No one got hurt, see?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020781" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about the Protectors? They aren't soldiers--those were civilians he killed!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020783" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's with the Regulators. They betrayed everyone on Makeb!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020785" id2="17" version="1065353216">My husband was trying to get seats on the ark for his family. That's all any of his men wanted. You would've done the same!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020786" id2="17" version="1065353216">You could have come to the Republic, to the Protectors--done all this without violence. Who says we wouldn't evacuate the Regulators' families?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020786" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why not just be honest?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020787" id2="17" version="1065353216">And would you've let us come along? Would Shalim?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020789" id2="17" version="1065353216">All of these people want to escape Makeb alive. They haven't put a gun to anyone's head to get there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020789" id2="17" version="1065353216">These people were innocent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020790" id2="17" version="1065353216">They had a choice! Our men didn't.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020792" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your husband and his men killed innocent people. They deserve to die for what they've done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020792" id2="17" version="1065353216">Last warning, lady.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020793" id2="17" version="1065353216">You killed the rest of my men... I'll die with them... but my family wasn't in on the plan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020795" id2="17" version="1065353216">No! We won't leave you behind!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020797" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please, let him go with us! He'll surrender to the Republic, I swear it!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020798" id2="17" version="1065353216">You and your husband can get on the ark, but he'll have to answer for what he's done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020798" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll all be saved.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020799" id2="17" version="1065353216">A ticket to jail, huh.... Sure you want to be a criminal's wife?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020801" id2="17" version="1065353216">Better than being his widow. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020803" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's not leaving Makeb alive. As for the rest of you...  the resistance will sort you out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020803" id2="17" version="1065353216">Justice first. [Kill the mercenary]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020804" id2="17" version="1065353216">No! Please, don't kill him!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020806" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arrin...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020808" id2="17" version="1065353216">None of that. Go on, get out of here... time to go. For all of us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020810" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's all right, everyone. Just stay where you are. We'll get a head count and check your vitals.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020812" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did the right thing with Captain Nikols. We appreciate it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020813" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stay back! I'll blast everyone in here, I swear it!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1056339" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Regulators are gone. We just want out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1102167" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll do what I can.</text>
