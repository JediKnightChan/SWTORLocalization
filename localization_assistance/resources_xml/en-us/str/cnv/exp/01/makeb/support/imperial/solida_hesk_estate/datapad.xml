RE: Access Codes
What is it about &quot;highly classified&quot; that you find so difficult to understand? I'll transmit the Hutt Embassy access codes THIS ONE TIME if you promise me you'll memorize them and then DELETE this message! The last thing we need is for anyone to root through the network because you left your blasted datapad lying around or something. Are we clear?</text>
