		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1067423" id2="17" version="1065353216">I demand to have a spot on the ark. My family has been here for generations!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1067425" id2="17" version="1065353216">More like resting on your laurels for generations. Sir, I'm willing to spend whatever it takes to secure a compartment for my family.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1067427" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please, calm yourselves. Both of your families are safe. The ark has room for everybody left on Makeb.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1067433" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we have to, we can fit one-and-a-half Makebs into the ark. Take a look at these schematics. There's enough room.</text>
