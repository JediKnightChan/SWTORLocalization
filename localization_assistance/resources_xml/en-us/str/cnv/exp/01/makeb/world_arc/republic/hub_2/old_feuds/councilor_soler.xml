		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1013820" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperial warned you this would happen. Why couldn't you just let them go?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014882" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shalim's expecting you at his new camp. We can take care of ourselves now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014883" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't kill these people. That Imperial did, and I made sure he paid for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1014883" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is war.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014884" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never meant for this to happen. I thought I could stop him before he pulled the trigger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1014884" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry. It was a mistake.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014885" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll have to leave the bodies. We barely have enough speeders as it is.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014887" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't answer to you. Just get these people out of here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1014887" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shut up and do your job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014888" id2="17" version="1065353216">Y--yes, of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014890" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should contact Shalim, let him know we're bringing wounded....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014892" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank goodness you're... wait, where is Mayor Erkens?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014893" id2="17" version="1065353216">The mayor's dead. This whole mesa has become a combat zone, and it's crumbling to pieces. We need to evacuate the wounded right now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1014893" id2="17" version="1065353216">She didn't make it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014896" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have more problems than Toborro. Imperial forces came here to retrieve samples of isotope-5. They killed the mayor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1014896" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got the Empire here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014897" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a loss--and now we have the Empire to contend with?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014899" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got bigger problems. It looks like Toborro has an army of those isotope-5 droids.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1014899" id2="17" version="1065353216">Toborro has many droids.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014900" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then our jobs just got a lot harder.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014902" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're ready to evacuate, but many of our people were wounded in the attack.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1014904" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've established a medical triage center. I'm sending the coordinates, Soler. Get your people to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020380" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've also relocated to a new camp near the ark construction site. I'm transmitting coordinates. Meet me here to plot our strategy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020381" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have we managed to investigate Toborro's claims about the ark's fuel supply?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020381" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any news on the ark?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020382" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're concentrating all of your forces in one area. Toborro won't resist that temptation for long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020382" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've made yourself a target.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020383" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our proximity to the ark limits the kinds of attacks he can make. Aerial bombardment is now off the menu.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020385" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't make this any more complicated than it has to be. Point me at Toborro, and I'll put an end to him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1020385" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's simple: Kill Toborro.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020386" id2="17" version="1065353216">If only it were that simple.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1020388" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Republic engineer just arrived. He's analyzing the ark schematics now. Get here as soon as you can.</text>
