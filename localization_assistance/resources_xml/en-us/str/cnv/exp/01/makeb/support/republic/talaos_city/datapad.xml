Subject: RE: Internment?

We do what we're paid to do. Shuffling people between secure locations keeps them from organizing against us. That keeps the Hutts' projects running smooth, which keeps the credits flowing into our pockets, which pays your salary.

If you like getting paid, round the people up, check them with the database, and then send them on their way.

If you need &quot;time to think&quot;, I'll have you put on a few dozen cleaning details, and you can do your thinking in the 'freshers, where no one will bother you.</text>
