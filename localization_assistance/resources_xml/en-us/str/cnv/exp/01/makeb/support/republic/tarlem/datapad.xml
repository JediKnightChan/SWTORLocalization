Subject: RE: File Deletion(!)
Might want to keep copies? For what? Do you think Toborro's going be able to build a second ark?

Toborro has promised we'll get on that ark, but we have to keep the Republic from taking off with it first. The best way to do that right now is to keep the various fuel-component schematics out of Republic hands so they won't know how it works.

All other copies across the planet are already wiped, and we don't have remote access from here. Again, the redundancy system stores the files across terminals, so you'll have to wipe them all manually. Firebomb them if you have to! And hurry!
