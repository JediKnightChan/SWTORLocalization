You're absolutely correct that the lasers are causing the groundquakes. I do not agree, however, that Makeb is in danger; I merely believe these quakes will end in unison with the drilling. To prove I'm correct, I've set up some sensors of my own to monitor sub-mantle plate integrity. I will let you know once my hypothesis is confirmed.

Surprised I haven't heard back from you by now. Please be safe.
