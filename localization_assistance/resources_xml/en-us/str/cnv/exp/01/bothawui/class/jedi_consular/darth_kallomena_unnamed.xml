		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1022157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stay... stay back. All this, and the boy Torwin... I just need to think.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1022161" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1022163" id2="17" version="1065353216">So... so your reputation stands. You... really do know which end of a lightsaber is which.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1022165" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Jedi, are you there? Your presence seems to be having an impact. We're seeing movement along the Empire's defensive line.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1022167" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll get him, Master Jedi, even if we have to invade Liah'starn to do it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1022169" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tread carefully, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1051432" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know.... You seek the boy and his pets. How did the Jedi learn about him? Speak!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1051433" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't get to make demands of me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1051433" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't answer to Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1051434" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force gave me a vision of him--and the destruction that surrounds him. I had to find him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1051434" id2="17" version="1065353216">I had a vision.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053602" id2="17" version="1065353216">The boy... spoke of a vision. What have you told him? Speak!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053603" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin is at the center of cataclysm that will engulf the galaxy. The Force revealed it to me, and I told him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053603" id2="17" version="1065353216">I told him his future.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053604" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin Vehl isn't even an apprentice. So what are you? His protector? His servant?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053604" id2="17" version="1065353216">What is he to you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053606" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wrong. Someone will answer for this. You, or... or Torwin if he's fool enough to defy me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053608" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, there was a vision. But it came... to a Jedi, and not to me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053610" id2="17" version="1065353216">But, that comes later. After... a moment to rest. Do not follow.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053612" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are those the only options? I'm the discipline that... keeps chaos in check.</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1053668" id2="17" version="1065353216">Back into shadow. Pfagh, even scent is gone. Strange prey, this Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053669" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blast it all! It's like trying to pin down an Adegan eel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053670" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get back here! This isn't over!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053671" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master, are you alright? Did that woman leave any injuries or indelible stains?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053672" id2="17" version="1065353216">Watch your back! No telling where she is.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053673" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gone again. And... I can't even sense where she went. How is that possible?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053674" id2="17" version="1065353216">Protest: Master, if this aggravating individual persists in remaining undeleted, I cannot speak for my mental state.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053675" id2="17" version="1065353216">A vision? Revealed... revealed to you, and not me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053679" id2="17" version="1065353216">Something to think on as... as I rest. Do not follow.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053682" id2="17" version="1065353216">But that's... that's not your concern. And mine is... taking a moment to rest.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053688" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those strong in the dark side of the Force can cloud one's senses, to their own advantage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053688" id2="17" version="1065353216">The dark side confuses.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053690" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget about her; what matters is Torwin Vehl. If he gets off-planet, we may not be able to catch him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053690" id2="17" version="1065353216">We must intercept Torwin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053692" id2="17" version="1065353216">She can't have gone far. Search the ruins; she's our best link to Torwin Vehl.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053692" id2="17" version="1065353216">Search for her!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053693" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hold that thought, HK. There'll be a time to deal with her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053693" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll get her. Just wait.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053697" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nothing about this is normal. This &quot;hunt&quot; will require caution.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053697" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everything here is strange.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053699" id2="17" version="1065353216">Holiday, quickly: Which way did she go?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053699" id2="17" version="1065353216">Holiday, can you track her?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053701" id2="17" version="1065353216">She can't run forever. Eventually she'll run out of hiding places.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053701" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll get her, Zenith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053703" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm fine. I've survived much worse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053703" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry about me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053705" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's a sly one, whoever she is. She's probably waiting for us somewhere nearby.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053705" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe she's laying an ambush.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053706" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're making a push into their territory; looks like we stand a chance of breaking through. Did you find Torwin Vehl?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053707" id2="17" version="1065353216">That masked Sith turned up just as I found Torwin. She tried to delay me while he escaped to a shuttle.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053707" id2="17" version="1065353216">I ran into a Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1053869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Save your demands. I am a Jedi; I don't answer to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1053869" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't give me orders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056307" id2="17" version="1065353216">But there will be answers.... Even if I have to wring them out of you and Torwin myself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056309" id2="17" version="1065353216">Scanning! Oh, phooey. No one but us in immediate range.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056311" id2="17" version="1065353216">I did, but he managed to slip away; he's trying to get off-planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056311" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, but he escaped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056312" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin's about to get off-planet. If the defense satellites are still available, I need them now more than ever.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056312" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need to track him again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056313" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll see what the feed has to say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056315" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least you made it out alright. Let me get into our defense satellite feed; maybe we can track him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056317" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our defense satellite feed is still up. Maybe I can see where Torwin went.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056319" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's headed toward... Liah'starn. A big Imperial-controlled settlement, around Bothawui's weather machine. The Empire's last bastion, shielded against satellite monitoring.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056321" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin likes to stay close to his creations. If we're careful, they might lead us right to him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056321" id2="17" version="1065353216">Track the beasts, find Torwin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056322" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said Liah'starn is under Imperial control. What else should I know? What defenses does it have?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056322" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about Liah'starn.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056325" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's a lot of those beasts on the outskirts, though. Maybe they're coming from Liah'starn?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056326" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget his creations, Commander. What matters is finding Torwin before he escapes the planet!</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056326" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just focus on Torwin!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056331" id2="17" version="1065353216">Understood. But maybe those things could tell us where in Liah'starn he's headed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056337" id2="17" version="1065353216">With their defensive line weakened, I can get a few scouts up there. When our forward position's set, I'll have them meet you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056601" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm willing to keep my distance; there's no need for anyone else to die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056601" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't have to fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056602" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hah. I can't fault your restraint; I'd have decapitated you by now. If I could.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056604" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're correct to question what you're doing. You must know better than anyone what Torwin's capable of.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056604" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're conflicted. Rightly so.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056605" id2="17" version="1065353216">As if I need a Jedi's &quot;wisdom&quot; to know my own mind. But, you are....</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056607" id2="17" version="1065353216">What you need, Sith, is to understand when you've failed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056607" id2="17" version="1065353216">Accept that you're beaten.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056608" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, truly, how I have failed. Torwin free, and I'm... still breathing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056627" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps we can be of use to each other. For the moment, at least.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056627" id2="17" version="1065353216">A truce, then. For now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056628" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need a Sith's assistance like I need a hole in the head--which you'd likely give me. Why should I ally with you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056628" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why do I need you?</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1056629" id2="17" version="1065353216">Herald, step soft. This dark thing has teeth bared for your spine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056631" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps, little lizard. Though I see that faith and pride have become your shackles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056633" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, past the crimson lightsaber and mask of terror, I'm sure she's a charming creature.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056635" id2="17" version="1065353216">So. The professor. All those gaudy dreams of grandeur.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056637" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi, she's standing right there. Kill her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056638" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not destroying someone who could help me stop Torwin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056638" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't. She's useful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056639" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't believe this. Maybe it's a ruse, or.... You're really sure this is a good idea?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056641" id2="17" version="1065353216">No better nor worse than bringing along a disgraced lieutenant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056643" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can feel what she is, what she can do. I don't know if this is wise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056645" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've heard of you. The girl-Jedi hiding power behind innocence. You remind me of Torwin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056647" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master, if you please... I wonder if this is safe; I don't have any parameters for this situation....</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056649" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I wonder how you can bear such chatter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056650" id2="17" version="1065353216">Query: Master, am I actually expected to exercise restraint around this organic?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056651" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose I can agree to that. After all, I can destroy you whenever I wish.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056651" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can always kill you later.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056652" id2="17" version="1065353216">So. Even more steel underneath....</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1056654" id2="17" version="1065353216">Know that Scorekeeper's claws touch your throat, dark thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056655" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, Jedi, your approach to negotiation has certainly... evolved.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056656" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do it now. Finish her off.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056657" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think she got the message when I defeated her earlier, Zenith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056657" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no need.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056658" id2="17" version="1065353216">Trust me, Zenith. We can take care of her once we have what we need.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056658" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will, later. Play along.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056659" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I want your input, I'll ask for it. Until then, be silent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056659" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't question my decisions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056660" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. She is a Darth; you can't trust her!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056662" id2="17" version="1065353216">And should she trust you--a terrorist, saboteur and liar? At least I don't hide what I am.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056664" id2="17" version="1065353216">And can he trust you, terrorist, liar and saboteur that you are? At least I don't hide what I am.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056669" id2="17" version="1065353216">Query: Are we taking turns, master? I have an excellent shot lined up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056670" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am the subjugator of Talesia, a scholar of the ancient Rakata, one who wandered the Korriba Scar and lived. You may call me Darth Kallomena.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056671" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm more interested in Torwin. What is he? Where did he get his ability?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056671" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about Torwin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056672" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I am the Barsen'thor of the Jedi Order, Herald of the Scorekeeper, who freed the Esh-kha and fought the First Son of the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056672" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have titles, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056673" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll call you whatever I wish; I only care that you can help me find Torwin Vehl.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056673" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your name doesn't matter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056674" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin is gone. He swore he was taking my shuttle to Imperial space, but he destroyed its transponder after takeoff.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056687" id2="17" version="1065353216">A fascinating relic. Very compassionate of you to try and give it purpose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056691" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then perhaps we can help each other. But Torwin destroyed my shuttle transponder after I ordered him to leave.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056750" id2="17" version="1065353216">Better follow through, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056752" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, barbed looks from the killer hiding behind the name &quot;freedom fighter.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056757" id2="17" version="1065353216">He unearthed a relic of the Rakata Infinite Empire here, on Bothawui. It became his prize test subject, the center of all... this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056758" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's why you came back. To find this test subject.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056758" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, you're here to find it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056760" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, one of the Republic commanders said Torwin had been involved in excavations here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056760" id2="17" version="1065353216">Niccos mentioned excavations.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056761" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've encountered relics of the Rakata Empire. They enslaved much of the galaxy millennia ago; I didn't realize they had left traces on Bothawui.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056761" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know of the Infinite Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056762" id2="17" version="1065353216">And to hopefully gain some leverage over Torwin, yes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056771" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't see much of his dig site, but apparently he dug up something worthwhile.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056773" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin called it &quot;the Custodian,&quot; said it could be our Empire's salvation. Though he refused to confide any more--a warning sign I missed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056777" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Torwin placed such value in this Custodian, wouldn't he have taken it with him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056777" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think it's still here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056778" id2="17" version="1065353216">If this Custodian has what we need, I'll be the one deciding how that knowledge gets used.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056778" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lead me. Not you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056779" id2="17" version="1065353216">Their Force-powered technology gave the ancient Rakata a long reach. Whatever Torwin unearthed will have many secrets. Hopefully they will lead us to him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056780" id2="17" version="1065353216">What exactly is this Custodian? An animal, a person--?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056780" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you know what to look for?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056781" id2="17" version="1065353216">It must be alive, despite its age. Given Torwin's other creations, it will be something aberrant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056786" id2="17" version="1065353216">This might go faster if we search separately. Don't worry--I'm in no condition to leave. Looking at you makes my wounds ache.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056794" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin won't have had time to transfer the Custodian out of his lab. If it's still on Bothawui, the Custodian is here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056805" id2="17" version="1065353216">Going to really enjoy killing her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056806" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmph. So much for keeping an eye on her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058344" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a farming settlement; it grew up around a weather machine that manages Bothawui's climate. The Imps have troops, artillery and armored units.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058569" id2="17" version="1065353216">No Jedi has ever bested me.... You, Torwin's disobedience, these abominations--everything is wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058571" id2="17" version="1065353216">You feel it, don't you? Something is happening, bigger than both of us. If I can't defeat you, then perhaps the Force has a lesson for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058572" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you believe the Force is trying to tell you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1058572" id2="17" version="1065353216">What kind of lesson?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058573" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've foreseen catastrophe surrounding Torwin. And you understand that Torwin has gone too far. Together, we might be able to stop him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1058573" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can help each other.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058574" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you really need a final proof that you're outmatched, I'll give it to you. At about neck height.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1058574" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes: know when you're beaten.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058581" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gall as well as teeth. Yes. Maybe this is the path.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058582" id2="17" version="1065353216">That attacking you will only gain me new scars.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058585" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have power, and purpose. I know Torwin, and I want the secrets he's kept from me. Couldn't a truce, of sorts, benefit us both?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058597" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know what's stranger--that you're offering help, or that I'm tempted to accept.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058599" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. We both need answers from Torwin. Together, we could find them. A truce, then?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058604" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed, so long as you remember: A truce is an act of good faith on both sides. Don't betray that trust.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1058604" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes. I hope I can trust you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1058605" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have no wish to be trounced again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062644" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have conquered worlds; spent decades studying forgotten cultures. I could give you access to my resources and the Empire's.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062646" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I've protected Torwin for months. I have more insight into him than anyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062647" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose that much, at least, is true....</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062675" id2="17" version="1065353216">It would take too much time to get something so ancient offworld. And he'd have wanted the Custodian close by. It's here, somewhere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062864" id2="17" version="1065353216">His family sent him to Korriban. The overseers sensed he had power, but Torwin had all the natural talent of a stone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062873" id2="17" version="1065353216">Failure is death. Torwin's final trial was to kill a gang of tomb robbers. His attack made one of them Force sensitive. He is a true anomaly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062951" id2="17" version="1065353216">Without his one talent, Torwin would have died unknown and forgotten. Just another failed acolyte.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1062951" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's a washout.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062953" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can see how the Sith would have found ways to use his ability, whether he wanted it or not.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1062953" id2="17" version="1065353216">That you decided to exploit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062982" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin was shunned, so he investigated his condition alone. That led him to ancient Force-sensitive cultures. I was asked to protect him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062983" id2="17" version="1065353216">I almost expected him to have learned this talent from a holocron, or from some Sith experiment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1062983" id2="17" version="1065353216">A natural gift? Surprising.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062984" id2="17" version="1065353216">Actually, the overseers almost put him to death, as a monster.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1062985" id2="17" version="1065353216">For all our scholarship, the Force can still surprise us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1075868" id2="17" version="1065353216">And the clock is ticking. There'll be time for a reckoning once the galaxy's safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1075869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. Fate of the galaxy's at stake. Otherwise, I'd say we kill her right now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1075874" id2="17" version="1065353216">Better to have her where we can keep an eye on her, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1075877" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't need to trust her. Just use what she knows.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1075896" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hear your superiors believed the same of you, once.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1075976" id2="17" version="1065353216">As you've killed so many before, in the name of freedom.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1075984" id2="17" version="1065353216">Advisory: Master, perhaps we should consider an alliance. Traditionally, allies are far easier to ambush.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1076001" id2="17" version="1065353216">Temperance, professor? I heard you didn't know the meaning of the word.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1076016" id2="17" version="1065353216">The daughter of Sarkhai is growing up. How like Torwin you are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1076019" id2="17" version="1065353216">He learned caution at the Korriban Academy; he had power, but no ability to demonstrate it.</text>
