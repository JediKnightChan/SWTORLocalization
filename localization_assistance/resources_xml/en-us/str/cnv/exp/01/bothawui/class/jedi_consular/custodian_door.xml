		<text bitflag="65" id1="1022123" id2="17" version="1065353216">[The chamber is partially frozen shut and sealed with a strange lock.]</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1022125" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin's organization of his specimens is as undisciplined as his mind. But it seems you've have better luck?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1022127" id2="17" version="1065353216">As a Jedi, you'll be delighted to know I have a question. Should you find Torwin, what do you intend to do?</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1022129" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who--? There is one. And another. Filled and brimming with power.</text>
		<text bitflag="65" id1="1022131" id2="17" version="1065353216">[The chamber is partially frozen shut and sealed with a strange lock.]</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056811" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fascinating. Rakata construction, as is the lock.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056812" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said you were a scholar of the Rakata. Prove it. Open the chamber.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056812" id2="17" version="1065353216">Open it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056815" id2="17" version="1065353216">There are similar chambers on Belsavis, keeping prisoners in suspended animation. This might explain how Torwin's &quot;relic&quot; survived.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1056815" id2="17" version="1065353216">Looks like a stasis chamber.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1056816" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're lucky I'm curious about this relic myself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057165" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just as well you've made no attempt to open it. This requires an expert touch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057171" id2="17" version="1065353216">That locking mechanism is considerable. Torwin wasn't taking any chances.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057171" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's impressive security.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057201" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin seems amenable. He can still change his path, once he's made to understand the danger he poses.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057201" id2="17" version="1065353216">Appeal to his reason.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057202" id2="17" version="1065353216">Truthfully? I should annihilate you for even making the threat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057203" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not about to share my plans to defend the galaxy with some Sith I just met.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057203" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not telling an enemy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057204" id2="17" version="1065353216">With the fate of the galaxy at stake, I'm taking no chances. Torwin has to die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057204" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kill him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057216" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck with that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057217" id2="17" version="1065353216">Smart move.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057218" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a meaningful concord we've achieved.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057220" id2="17" version="1065353216">Spoken like one who's never had to convince that boy of anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057221" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's too bad; there are... things I want to ask, about his powers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057222" id2="17" version="1065353216">Basic precaution. No offense.</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1057224" id2="17" version="1065353216">Herald's wisdom is not for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057330" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we're saving an entire galaxy, we can start with saving one person from himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057331" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, yes, the Jedi battle doctrine: Talk the opponent into submission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057528" id2="17" version="1065353216">But, Torwin's creations are unnatural. They twist the Force against itself. Something must be done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057529" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not just him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057532" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tactically, it makes sense; it just doesn't feel right. He's only a kid.</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1057536" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do... do not hurt the one who sought only to guard. Where is the boy? A begging: I do not want the gifts he gave. Take them back!</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057537" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are the Custodian, &quot;the one who sought to guard&quot;? You look like a Rakata, but....</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057537" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you?</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1057538" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was left sleeping, a watchman. The boy woke me. He gave power I did not want, hoping to buy my knowledge of the Shrouded Ones.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057539" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be at peace. You're in no danger. I just need some answers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057539" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're not going to hurt you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057540" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;The boy&quot; is who I want to find. You were his prize experiment; you must know something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057540" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm looking for Torwin.</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1057541" id2="17" version="1065353216">The one built to watch, to wait. To be useful.</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1057542" id2="17" version="1065353216">A remembering: the boy and his power, so like our empire's engineers. He came seeking things left behind from our last days.</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1057544" id2="17" version="1065353216">So did he.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057547" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've never come across that term in my studies. What are &quot;the Shrouded Ones&quot;?</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057547" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Shrouded Ones?</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057548" id2="17" version="1065353216">This poor creature wasn't a test subject. Torwin forced power upon him to try and get information.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057548" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin tried to bribe you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057549" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torwin didn't need Force-sensitive beasts or Bothans; he wanted these &quot;Shrouded Ones,&quot; and found a way to get what he needed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1104" id1="1057549" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those are what Torwin wants.</text>
		<text bitflag="1089" id1="1057550" id2="17" version="1065353216">Secrets on secrets. Torwin will answer for this. What does he intend with these Shrouded Ones?</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1057556" id2="17" version="1065353216">They are for no one. The Shrouded Ones were built to be the end of everything. A solution, to our empire's final problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="3137" id1="1057562" id2="17" version="1065353216">A fearing: The boy does not know what he seeks. The Shrouded Ones... he.... No! The gift... it devours!</text>
