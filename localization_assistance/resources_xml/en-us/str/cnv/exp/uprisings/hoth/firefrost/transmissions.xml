		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217146" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got trouble on Hoth. A group of White Maw pirates took over the Firefrost factory. A Houk named Droub is calling the shots.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217148" id2="17" version="1065353216">They've been stockpiling old military equipment. Using forced labor to melt it down so they can build new ships and weapons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217150" id2="17" version="1065353216">Droub's the last guy you want with that kind of firepower. You better get in there and shut this down before it's too late.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217159" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nice job, Commander. Droub and his crew were a threat to the whole sector. Not to mention all those workers you freed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217160" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sometimes I think you take things too far, Commander, but the galaxy is a safer place with Droub and his crew not in it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217162" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just so you know--I'm sending a salvage team into the Firefrost factory. Gotta be something in there we can use for the Alliance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217164" id2="17" version="1065353216">Making the galaxy a safer place while liberating dozens of innocent victims: not bad for a day's work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217167" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure the workers you freed appreciate it, too... at least, they will once they get over the trauma of witnessing what they're calling the White Maw Massacre.</text>
