		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217641" id2="17" version="1065353216">Disturbing intel coming in from our Republic sources, Commander. A group of rogue security agents on Coruscant is stirring up trouble with a false flag operation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217647" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're led by Commander Kallin, an outspoken critic of the Alliance. They're going to attack the Senate Tower and plant evidence that makes it look like we're to blame.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217650" id2="17" version="1065353216">We tracked Kallin and his followers to their hideout in Coruscant's industrial underbelly. Do the galaxy a favor and stop these scum!</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217655" id2="17" version="1065353216">Appreciate you taking out Kallin and those rogue security agents, Commander. I consider it a personal favor. This one hit close to home.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1217659" id2="17" version="1065353216">I used to think the Republic was better than the Sith, but those days are long gone. Guess that's why I'm with the Alliance now.</text>
