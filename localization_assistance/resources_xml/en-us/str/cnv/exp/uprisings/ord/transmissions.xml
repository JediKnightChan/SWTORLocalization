		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216067" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've sliced into the comms of Adacin and Zanisk. Happy eavesdropping, Commander.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216069" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have guests, Lord Adacin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216071" id2="17" version="1065353216">I told you they would come. Let's give them a warm Sith welcome!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216075" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have a task for you, Lord Wrad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216077" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kill the intruders. Prove your strength.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216079" id2="17" version="1065353216">I told you Lord Wrad was weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216081" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good help is hard to find. But at least now we've seen our enemies' tactics.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216083" id2="17" version="1065353216">If that's all they can offer, they won't pose much challenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216085" id2="17" version="1065353216">The intruders aren't dead. They're carving us to pieces!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216087" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have nothing to fear, Zanisk. Their defeat is inevitable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216089" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our guests are wearing my patience thin. It's time we met them personally.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216091" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't agree more!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216095" id2="17" version="1065353216">Alliance operatives have identified a major threat: a radicalized splinter group led by two powerful Sith Masters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216097" id2="17" version="1065353216">We tracked Lord Adacin and Lord Zanisk to a fortified volcano base on Ord Mantell. None of our agents have been able to breach the perimeter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216099" id2="17" version="1065353216">Adacin and Zanisk are ambitious. If you don't wipe them out, the galaxy will think we've gone soft.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216101" id2="17" version="1065353216">Adacin and Zanisk are ruthless, even by Sith standards. We need to eliminate this threat before it spreads to other worlds.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216105" id2="17" version="1065353216">Congratulations, Commander. You obliterated Adacin and Zanisk, crushing their uprising beneath the heel of the Alliance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216107" id2="17" version="1065353216">A handful of followers survived your assault, but they pose little threat. When you killed their masters, you broke their will to fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216109" id2="17" version="1065353216">This victory sends a powerful message to the rest of the galaxy: any opposition will be dealt with swiftly, harshly, and without mercy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216111" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well done, Commander. You neutralized Adacin and Zanisk, ending their threat to galactic stability.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216113" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're rounding up their followers, but without their masters driving them on, they don't pose much of a threat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1216115" id2="17" version="1065353216">You showed the galaxy that the Alliance won't run from a fight--though I doubt it will be the last time you need to send that message.</text>
