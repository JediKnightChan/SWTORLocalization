		<text bitflag="321" id1="1218032" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi Master Adelade is trying to awaken a dangerous abomination that has hibernated beneath the surface of Makeb for millennia. No records exist of this monstrosity, known only as Gethul. But if the creature awakes, it may be strong enough to destabilize Makeb's core and obliterate the planet.

Infiltrate the underground tunnel, secure explosives, and deliver the payload to Gethul's lair. Only then can you destroy the monstrosity--and save Makeb from Adelade's deranged plan.</text>
