		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1218072" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nice work, Commander. Now that you've taken the artillery bunkers off-line, our troops have re-secured the baradium mines for the Alliance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1218073" id2="17" version="1065353216">I fought many battles against the Sith alongside General Rike. He believed in the Republic... maybe too much. Made him see the Alliance as a threat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1218075" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander, there's a situation on Denova. Republic loyalists under General Amos Rike have seized control of the baradium mines.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1218103" id2="17" version="1065353216">They've set up several heavy artillery bunkers on the beachhead. We can't land troops on the surface until those bunkers are taken off-line.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1218105" id2="17" version="1065353216">It won't be easy, Commander. General Rike won many victories for the Republic: he wouldn't seize the baradium mines unless he was confident he could defend them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1218109" id2="17" version="1065353216">Amos spent decades defending the Republic from the Sith Empire. He still sees you as the enemy. I guess that's why he couldn't bring himself to trust the Alliance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1218110" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know he was technically our enemy and a traitor, but he was a good officer and soldier. That's how I'll try to remember him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1218113" id2="17" version="1065353216">I believe in the Alliance, Commander. I trust you. You know that. But part of me understands why General Rike did this.</text>
