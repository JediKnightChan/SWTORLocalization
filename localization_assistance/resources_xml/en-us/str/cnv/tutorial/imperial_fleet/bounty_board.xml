All citizens are expected to learn special skills to gather raw materials for crafting, craft new modifications for weapons and armor, or send your companions on missions for the glory of the Empire.  

Locate your nearest crafting, gathering, or mission trainer immediately and help the Empire win the war.</text>

Now we need you to do your part to show that we are a unified force, an unbreakable wall that will guard and guide every system of this galaxy in the new Imperial golden age.

Group up with Imperial citizens and earn enough Social Points to reach Social Rank I. Once you reach Social Rank I, purchase an Imperial Social Badge from Major Kahyin located at the Nexus Room Cantina on Dromund Kaas.</text>
