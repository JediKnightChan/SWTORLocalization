		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127626" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arkous and Darok were never going to be taken alive. They were never going to talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127627" id2="17" version="1065353216">I felt Darth Arkous's passing. This is an unfortunate turn.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1127629" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not unfortunate for me! I got my revenge!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127631" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, you did! What a relief!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127633" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blast it! Those two were running the show. They were our best hope of exposing the Revanites.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127635" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. They weren't in charge. The disturbance in the Force, I still feel it. It's... arrived.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127637" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got company! Ships. Capital-sized, whole bunch of them. Can't tell if they're yours or ours, but one of them's dropping in to visit!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127641" id2="17" version="1065353216">As important as Arkous and Darok were to the cause, their deaths won't stop us. They won't even slow us down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127643" id2="17" version="1065353216">Darok and Arkous fought to their last breath. We won't be getting any information from them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1127644" id2="17" version="1065353216">Copy that... blast it....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128047" id2="17" version="1065353216">That voice, I've heard it before.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128049" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's Revan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128051" id2="17" version="1065353216">I almost had the Infinite Army I wanted so badly. But even without them, I have enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128052" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you think you can take on the Empire, you're in for a rude awakening.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1128052" id2="17" version="1065353216">It won't be enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128053" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know all about rude awakenings. I won't suffer one again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128055" id2="17" version="1065353216">I watched you take your last breath and say your last words.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1128055" id2="17" version="1065353216">I saw you die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128056" id2="17" version="1065353216">You seem rather alive for someone who's supposed to be a corpse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1128056" id2="17" version="1065353216">I heard you were dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128057" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, I was dead--for all of a blink.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128059" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stop hiding behind the hull of that ship and we'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1128059" id2="17" version="1065353216">Face me, coward.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128060" id2="17" version="1065353216">Goading me into battle might have worked before I died, but not anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128062" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been reborn. My mind is clearer, my power intensified. And now, with the order under my command, I'm unstoppable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128063" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you wanted nothing to do with the Order of Revan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128064" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're telling me the Revanites weren't always under your control?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128065" id2="17" version="1065353216">At first, I wanted nothing to do with them. I was no prophet. Then I saw them in a new light.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128067" id2="17" version="1065353216">A secret group of devotees waiting to follow my lead without question? To help me save the galaxy? I was a fool to ever disregard them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128069" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've finally let the Revanites into my world--a world you have to be erased from.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128071" id2="17" version="1065353216">Turbolasers are locking on...! Get out of there!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1128807" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why should we care what they could have said? They were weak liars!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128809" id2="17" version="1065353216">I must agree with my master. They're far more trustworthy as corpses.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128811" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... sense something. We're in danger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128813" id2="17" version="1065353216">Multiple sensor contacts! Capital ships are dropping out of hyperspace--no IDs. One of them's coming in hot!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128817" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arkous and Darok were valuable allies in my cause. But their deaths will not delay what is coming.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128819" id2="17" version="1065353216">That voice....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128821" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's him. Revan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128823" id2="17" version="1065353216">My Infinite Army could have achieved so much. But I still have other weapons in my arsenal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128824" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were reported dead. Was that report wrong?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1128824" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you were dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128825" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic freed you! Why would you betray your rescuers?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1128825" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why have you betrayed us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128826" id2="17" version="1065353216">I helped free you from Imperial captivity. And now you're turning around and betraying the Republic?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1128826" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why have you betrayed us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128827" id2="17" version="1065353216">I promise, you don't have any weapons powerful enough to stop me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1128827" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bring it on!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128828" id2="17" version="1065353216">That remains to be seen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128830" id2="17" version="1065353216">My followers are legion. My ranks grow every hour, as more and more people see the truth of the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128832" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor couldn't break me. Even death could not stop me. I will finish what I've started. And you will not interfere again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1128834" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're powering up weapons! Get out of there--now!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1129033" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only somewhat. When a goal is important enough, one learns to overcome any obstacle.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1129035" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic is too weak and unfocused to do what must be done. To achieve my goals, all distractions must be swept aside.</text>
