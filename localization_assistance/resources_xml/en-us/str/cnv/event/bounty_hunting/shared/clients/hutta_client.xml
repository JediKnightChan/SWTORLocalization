		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112950" id2="17" version="1065353216">Grov put up a fight, but he didn't live up to his namesake. His ultimate fate is yours to decide.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112951" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've found Grov the Destroyer?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112952" id2="17" version="1065353216">This one won't trouble you or your boss anymore--unless you initiate the thawing sequence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112953" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must be Lo'tar. Let's talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112954" id2="17" version="1065353216">I take it this is proof enough?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112955" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your &quot;Destroyer&quot; has been destroyed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112966" id2="17" version="1065353216">What? Oh. This is about the contract. Of course. That's why I'm here. Not because I'm hiding out or anything....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112977" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's this Evocii gangster. Calls himself &quot;Grov the Destroyer&quot;--which is appropriate, because he's destroying my boss's business. Challenging the Hutts--what's he thinking, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112978" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I don't stop Grov's operations, my boss will throw me to the chemilizards. And if he doesn't, Grov's hired thugs will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112983" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've made a wise choice. Grov's gang doesn't stand a chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112983" id2="17" version="1065353216">No need to worry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112984" id2="17" version="1065353216">When this is over, it's Grov's people who will be lizard food.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112984" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not if they're dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112985" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why won't you say who you work for?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112985" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who's your boss?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112986" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm in enough trouble already without word getting around I took on outside help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112993" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck with the hunt. I'll be right here--with a stiff drink.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112994" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now there's a plan I can get behind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112995" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a real load off. You have no idea.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112999" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fat chance. I swear, that wasn't a Hutt pun.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113001" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who's lizard food? Not me--and that's what really matters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113003" id2="17" version="1065353216">For a job well done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113005" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah. Once his gangster herd got thinned out, Grov had to pick up the slack, get more personally committed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113007" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now that he's stuck his head out, I'm hoping he'll lose it. Then I can keep my job--and, you know, my life.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113009" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, thank you. Thank you. I can't tell you how much this means.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113011" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll worry about that later. What matters is the Destroyer's done. Finished.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113012" id2="17" version="1065353216">What am I saying? Of course I can. I have credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113016" id2="17" version="1065353216">Better get back to work. I told the boss I was going to the 'fresher. Hope he doesn't notice I've been gone so long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113032" id2="17" version="1065353216">And what matters more--I'm not going to be anybody's lizard food. Best credits I ever spent.</text>
