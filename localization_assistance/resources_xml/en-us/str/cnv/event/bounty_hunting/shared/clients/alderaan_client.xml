		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112839" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your son. Alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112840" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said we would discuss Claw.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112841" id2="17" version="1065353216">An associate of Claw's--dealt with, as you requested.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112842" id2="17" version="1065353216">I take it you're the client.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112843" id2="17" version="1065353216">And you're the contractors? An impressive group.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112844" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I take it you're the contractor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112846" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dariana Frayus, matriarch of House Frayus. I require your services in the disbanding of a particular group of local nuisances. They answer to a hooligan who calls himself &quot;Claw&quot;.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112848" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hooligans and nuisances? That won't be a problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112848" id2="17" version="1065353216">Consider them disbanded.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112850" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nuisances? I like the sound they make when their throats are under my heel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112850" id2="17" version="1065353216">They'll get squashed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112851" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're matriarch of a House of Alderaan. Why the need for outside help?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112851" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't you have staff for this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112853" id2="17" version="1065353216">We are a lesser House--not a militaristic power like House Organa. Perhaps if we had confronted him sooner....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112855" id2="17" version="1065353216">My, how descriptive. I only hope that I never become an obstacle to you as Claw has to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112856" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should hope not, but I would like to caution you all the same.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112858" id2="17" version="1065353216">He began as a harmless prankster, our Claw, but now he has escalated--demolitions, armed robberies, kidnappings. Innocents have died because of his thoughtless antics.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112861" id2="17" version="1065353216">Deal with Claw's associates; then perhaps we could discuss what to do about the young man himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112927" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll find a little less trouble surfacing around House Frayus after today.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112928" id2="17" version="1065353216">In carbonite. Perfect for display in the public square.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112929" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well done. I feel less troubled already.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112931" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, of course. Claw. The most heinous of them all. My son.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112935" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was such a good-natured boy before he fell in with the wrong crowd. And now....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112937" id2="17" version="1065353216">We must all pay the price for our wrongs. He will pay his, as I will mine. Go to him and see that justice is done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112939" id2="17" version="1065353216">Claw is dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112940" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. I believe I will let him remain this way for a time--at least until I devise a plan to rehabilitate him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112941" id2="17" version="1065353216">I knew it might come to that--but I fear my son may have already died the day he became Claw.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112943" id2="17" version="1065353216">All of your work is greatly appreciated. Good day to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113034" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here. I believe you've earned this.</text>
