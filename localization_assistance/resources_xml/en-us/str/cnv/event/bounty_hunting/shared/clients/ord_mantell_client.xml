		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112960" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's done. Brogon is all yours.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112961" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ex-Colonel Brogon has officially been killed in action. Here's the proof.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112962" id2="17" version="1065353216">The crew is dealt with--it's time to go after Brogon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112963" id2="17" version="1065353216">Brogon's crew doesn't mess around, but I managed to catch one of them for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112964" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can scratch one of Brogon's crew off your list.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112965" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you Ariavos? I'm here about the bounty posting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112967" id2="17" version="1065353216">At last. Thank you for coming--I have all of the information here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112969" id2="17" version="1065353216">Colonel Brogon. Ex-colonel Brogon. He's got a whole pack of ex-soldiers who extort credits from refugees and citizens alike. Those who won't pay are beaten... or worse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112972" id2="17" version="1065353216">Their extortion ends today. I'll see to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112972" id2="17" version="1065353216">They'll face justice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112973" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I'll pay handsomely.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112974" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyone who works for Brogon is dead, starting now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112974" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll wipe them out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112975" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have you taken this to the local authorities?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1112975" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you try official channels?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112979" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course! How do you think he became &quot;ex&quot; colonel Brogon? That didn't stop him... it only made things worse....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112981" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've watched. I've seen everywhere those scum go, and everyone they talk to. With what I've learned, you'll have no problem finding them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112988" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good. Let them see what it's like.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1112991" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just be careful. These men are killers--they won't hesitate. I learned that firsthand....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113140" id2="17" version="1065353216">Finally, real results. You don't know how much this means.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113141" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dead? Good. It's no more than that scum deserves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here's your fee. There's plenty more where that came from, if you're interested in taking down more of Brogon's thugs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113165" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perfect. Thanks to you, we have everything we need to find him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113167" id2="17" version="1065353216">Brogon loves to make people watch while he... he kills their families. I wish I could watch while you do the same to him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113171" id2="17" version="1065353216">At last.... he'll finally face true punishment for what he's done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113176" id2="17" version="1065353216">Adani, Torin, Vara... you finally have the justice you deserve.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113179" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. Thank you so much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1113180" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was so sure that he would never be punished. That no one would ever touch him.</text>
