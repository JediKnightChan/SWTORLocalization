		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1118289" id2="17" version="1065353216">Continuing our coverage of this most recent breakout of the rakghoul plague, I'm joined now by Addalar Hyland, founder of the philanthropic organization THORN.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1118294" id2="17" version="1065353216">Mister Hyland, you're largely known as the CEO of Galactic Solutions Industries, or GSI. Why did you create The Hyland Organization for Rakghoul Neutralization?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1118296" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, no, I don't care to talk about myself. I want to speak directly to the populace here....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1118298" id2="17" version="1065353216">The rakghoul plague is deadly, and must be contained. If you're on the infected world--remain indoors. If you even think you may be infected--seek quarantine immediately.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1118312" id2="17" version="1065353216">Finally, if you have the inclination and ability to assist THORN--we need your help. Desperately. That's it; that's all I have.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1118314" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's... direct from the, uh, very direct Addalar Hyland. A dire warning, and an impassioned plea for help with combating the rakghoul plague....</text>
