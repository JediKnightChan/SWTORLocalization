Holo-reconstruction of the temple designated &quot;Emperor's Eye&quot; at its peak usage continues to lag behind schedule. To put it bluntly, whoever designed the Omni series droids should find another line of work. Their power consumption is off the charts! Way past even GSI's battledroids, I'm sure.

Requesting (again) a new shipment of power cells--at least three times the size of the previous order. Then and only then can we complete the data retrieval process and properly compile a full temple model for holo-projection. Until then, we'll be down here. Waiting.</text>
