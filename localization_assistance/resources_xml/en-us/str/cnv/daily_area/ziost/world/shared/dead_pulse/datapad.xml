Through fissures in Ziost's crust, geomagnetic activity has been detected that may be indicative of EM pulses of incredible speed. It is unclear whether the planet's catastrophic event is responsible for the anomaly, or whether the anomaly can be replicated for technological purposes. An onsite study following an active pulse via Rapid Geoanalysis Scout could provide the data required to better understand the phenomenon.
