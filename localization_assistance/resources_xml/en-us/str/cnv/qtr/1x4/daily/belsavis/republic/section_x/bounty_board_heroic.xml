The SIS has determined the Dread Masters' true objective: an ancient Rakata weapon known as the &quot;Aurora Cannon.&quot;

Preliminary analysis shows that this weapon could vaporize every Republic soldier on Belsavis in a single shot. It cannot be allowed to fall into enemy hands.

A strike team is authorized to locate the Aurora Cannon and disable it with electromagnetic pulse munitions.

ALERT: The Dread Guard has deployed extensive forces to retrieve this weapon. Attempting this mission without a full strike team is not advised.</text>

The Aurora Cannon has been disabled. Although Dread Guard forces remain in the area, their objective has been lost forever.

Additional forces will begin final assault and recovery operations immediately. For the Republic!</text>
