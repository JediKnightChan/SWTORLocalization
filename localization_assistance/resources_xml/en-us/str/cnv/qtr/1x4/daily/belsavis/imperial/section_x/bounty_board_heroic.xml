The goal of the Dread Masters' forces on Belsavis has been discovered: an ancient Rakata weapon known as the &quot;Aurora Cannon.&quot;

This single device is capable of eliminating all Imperial forces on Belsavis in a single strike. It must be disabled before the Dread Masters' minions can capture it.

Once the cannon is located, it should be immediately disabled via electromagnetic pulse munitions.

WARNING: A massive Dread Guard deployment has been mobilized to retrieve the device. A full-size strike team is recommended before attempting to engage.</text>

The Aurora Cannon has been disabled--a crushing defeat for the Dread Masters and their cowardly servants.

Patrol teams will be dispatched to eliminate any remaining enemy forces within Section X. Glory to the Empire!</text>
