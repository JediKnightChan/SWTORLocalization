		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1069526" id2="17" version="1065353216">We leave this for any who follow. We found this abandoned starship called Theoretika, registered to Czerka Corporation. Air thin, but breathable. Power minimal.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1069562" id2="17" version="1065353216">We forced open turbolift panels. We climbed down and brought droids called &quot;illuminators&quot; to see. We saw many bodies.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1069591" id2="17" version="1065353216">We learned of treasure locked inside a distant lab. Then, three of our mates became bodies. It was sabotage.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1069593" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever schematics for the droid called &quot;HK assassin&quot; might be, they aren't worth such trouble. This ship is a trap of death.</text>
