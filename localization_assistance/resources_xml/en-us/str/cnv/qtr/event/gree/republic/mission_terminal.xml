To directly facilitate red radian, please activate any of the pylons spread through this region to begin Gray Secant's combat assessment program. Challenging opponents will be engaged immediately, and your displays of prowess recorded for all time!

The Gree Enclave happily advances blue parallel to all who participate!</text>

Recovery and recycling of data implants from Gray Secant combat specimens would surely facilitate efficient acquisition of blue acute.

Samples from local crystal formations and wildlife would also contribute valued understandings.

May your activities proceed to red tangent!</text>

The Strategic Information Service would like to get a look at some of the data being collected by this Gree starship. If they're studying our military strengths, we'd like to get an idea of what they're learning--and why.

Operatives are directed to tap into any Gree probe relays they can reach. Access protocols can be retrieved from the Gree combat droids already present in the field. 

These probe relays are likely to be well-defended, so caution and superior firepower are advised. That said, please act as discreetly as possible--we can't afford to endanger our relations with the Gree under any circumstances.</text>

Opponents embodying green perpendicular await within the vessel's corridors. Face them and rejoice in unparalleled data generation!</text>

A pirate group known as the Tonvarr has managed to discover Ilum's coordinates and land their raiding parties nearby. They're attempting to loot advanced Gree technology--primarily weapons.

We cannot allow these items to fall into outlaw hands. All Tonvarr forces should be engaged on sight, and any stolen Gree technology retrieved. Priority targets include the group's captains and shuttles. 

If possible, also recover any hyperspace navigation logs carried by the pirates' navigators. If we can determine how they're reaching Ilum, we may be able to cut them off completely.</text>

Due to increased Imperial activity in this sector, we're prioritizing the recovery of data assets from damaged military equipment that was left behind after previous engagements.

Data cores containing military intelligence are present in several downed vehicles--both our own, and the enemy's. It is crucial that we recover this data before the Imperials can.

Memory cores from enemy droids could also provide valuable intel.

Bonus pay will be offered for all collected materials. Good hunting.</text>

Gree energy condensers and pylons have been spotted in the contested area of the Western Ice Shelf. It's not clear whether they carry the same destructive potential as similar objects our forces have encountered on Seline, but we can't risk such powerful technology falling into Imperial hands.

Enemy forces are collecting the energy harvested by the condensers and using it to charge the pylons, so we have no choice but to do the same. Secure the pylons and do whatever you can to contain the threat.

Given how volatile these pylons can be, teams should be limited to four personnel. Good luck out there.</text>
