Councillor Torvix continues to rely on the Coronas street gang to maintain control of the Black Hole.

The Coronas are led by Kovic, aka &quot;the Shadow of Corellia.&quot; His CorSec criminal profile references key phrases: vicious, sociopath, power hungry, weapons collector, extremely dangerous.

Supreme Chancellor Saresh has authorized all forces to target Kovic. Intelligence suggests he is preparing for another raid at the heart of the Black Hole.

Strike down the &quot;Shadow of Corellia&quot; and our forces may finally liberate the Black Hole.</text>

Kovic's defeat has broken the Coronas gang. Councillor Torvix's hold on the Black Hole is shattered.

Containment actions are begun and the arrest of Torvix will follow. The flow of hypermatter to the Republic fleet may resume at last.</text>
