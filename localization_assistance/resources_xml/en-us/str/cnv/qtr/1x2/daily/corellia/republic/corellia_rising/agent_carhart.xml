		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005472" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've come this far. We can't lose Corellia now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005473" id2="17" version="1065353216">Officer Dakron's been coordinating our efforts in the Black Hole. He's the man to see if you're going to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005476" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Breaking news from the Core: Despite a stunning victory over the Empire, Republic forces continue to face violence and unrest on Corellia.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005478" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Of particular concern to Republic authorities is the 'Black Hole' region, where most of the planet's hypermatter processing facilities and warehouses are located.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005480" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Though most of the Black Hole is occupied by criminals and mercenaries, Imperial forces remaining on the planet are also attempting to claim its resources.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005482" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Sources say the Black Hole is critical to the Republic war effort. Without sufficient quantities of hypermatter fuel, the fleet could be grounded within weeks.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005484" id2="17" version="1065353216">They always said losing Corellia would lose us the war. Didn't really believe it until now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005485" id2="17" version="1065353216">I fought my way across Axial Park and into the Legislature. I was there when we declared Corellia was free!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005485" id2="17" version="1065353216">But we won Corellia!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005486" id2="17" version="1065353216">So I've heard. The Supreme Chancellor thought you might be sympathetic to our little problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005487" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wasn't part of the fight, but this news report makes it sound like Corellia was already won.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005487" id2="17" version="1065353216">Isn't Corellia ours?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005488" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our forces broke the Imperial occupation. But no one's giving this planet up easy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005489" id2="17" version="1065353216">There are plenty of planets in the Republic. We'll just have to find hypermatter fuel somewhere else.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005489" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not worried.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005490" id2="17" version="1065353216">A lot of men died to win Corellia the first time. If we lose the Black Hole, then they died for nothing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005491" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you always this friendly to total strangers? Or am I just special?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005491" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do I know you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005492" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry to intrude, but the news report interested me. I'm hoping it interests you, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005494" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Officials believe the unrest in the Black Hole is being encouraged by Harmon Torvix, a former member of the Corellian Council and a known Imperial sympathizer.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005496" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Though the Empire has denounced Torvix, he maintains control of the area with the help of the Coronas, a powerful crime syndicate based in Coronet City.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005498" id2="17" version="1065353216">Powerful? The Coronas are vicious. Their leader, Kovic, is known as the &quot;Shadow of Corellia.&quot; Likes to make CorSec officers disappear from broad daylight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005500" id2="17" version="1065353216">He knows Corellia as well as any CorSec officer and twice as well as our men. If the Republic wants to take the Black Hole, they'll need to take him down first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005501" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must watch an awful lot of these news reports.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005501" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're well informed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005502" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like to stay up-to-date. You never know what's going to come in handy later.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005503" id2="17" version="1065353216">Seems like the Republic or CorSec could use this information.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005503" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why tell me this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005504" id2="17" version="1065353216">You never know. You might find yourself in the Black Hole one of these days.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005505" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not afraid of a shadow. The Republic shouldn't be either.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005505" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kovic's just a thug.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005506" id2="17" version="1065353216">They might not be, if they had someone so confident around.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005508" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;The Supreme Chancellor is aware of the crisis on Corellia. After a consultation with her advisors, she sent the following message to Republic forces in the field.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005510" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;The fight ahead will be difficult. But you've already won Corellia. As long as we stand with our allies, no one can take it from us again.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005512" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too bad pretty words don't fuel starships. The Republic can't lose the Black Hole, to Councillor Torvix or the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005514" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agent Carhart, SIS. The Supreme Chancellor asked me to make sure you were aware of the situation. She's hoping you'll volunteer to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005515" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll do whatever it takes to help the Republic win.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005515" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sign me up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005516" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Republic is in need, the Jedi will answer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005516" id2="17" version="1065353216">For her, always.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005517" id2="17" version="1065353216">I volunteered for this back on Ord Mantell. Just tell me where to go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005517" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's my job to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005518" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why not? The Chancellor usually makes it worth my while.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005518" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds profitable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005519" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not taking on the whole Empire and Torvix's goons by myself, am I?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="1005519" id2="17" version="1065353216">Help do what, exactly?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005520" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hopefully it won't come to that. But you'll have to get to Corellia fast.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005522" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Black Hole's located in Labor Valley. Once you get in, talk to CorSec officer Sal Dakron. He'll put you to work wherever you're needed most.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005524" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll let the Supreme Chancellor know where you're headed. I'm sure she'll appreciate it. Good luck down there.</text>
		<text bitflag="336" id1="1005526" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too busy. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1005527" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome to Carrick Station, friend. Heard any interesting news lately?</text>
