		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1038576" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've synergized a whole new breed; dynamic, aggressive, intelligent....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1038584" id2="17" version="1065353216">Intruders. Of course. When people need solutions, they expect Czerka will provide--willingly or not.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1038827" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're out of your league.</text>
