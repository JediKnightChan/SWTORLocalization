		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049159" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please don't speak; your end of the line isn't secure. Call me Agent Reeho; I'm with Republic SIS.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049161" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Chevin Conglomerate is a group of unscrupulous thugs. I believe their &quot;Grand Acquisitions Race&quot; is actually a cover for a bigger plot. But I need data.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049163" id2="17" version="1065353216">Several Chevin just arrived from offworld. Please, take the listening device attached to this transmitter and plant it nearby. See what they say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049165" id2="17" version="1065353216">Help me, and I'll help you &quot;acquire&quot; some of the items on your list. You'll be duly compensated. Reeho, signing off.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1049186" id2="17" version="1065353216">There. The Senator's private line belongs to us. Now, your report shall be given.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1049188" id2="17" version="1065353216">I sent you a blasted report yesterday. There's no sign yet; believe me, I'm looking.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1049190" id2="17" version="1065353216">An unacceptable situation. The fleet could arrive momentarily. An opportunity may be missed!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049192" id2="17" version="1065353216">What &quot;fleet&quot;? This is bigger than I thought. We need to dig deeper.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049194" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. Tracking Derester; that scum carries packages for Chevin slavers. Maybe you can &quot;persuade&quot; him to cough up some information? I'll be in touch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049212" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agent Reeho here. I've been studying the data you got from Derester, and admiring how you handled him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049214" id2="17" version="1065353216">According to Derester's intel, several Chevin High Acquisitors are meeting on Nar Shaddaa. There's got to be answers there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049216" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you could listen in on that meeting, without being seen, we could crack this thing wide open. If you're game, notify me when you're in position.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049229" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're sadly mistaken. And this pathetic scavenger hunt won't buy any good graces.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1049231" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your impoverished Empire cannot even offer enrichment opportunities to your own people. The Conglomerate can, and will.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="1049238" id2="17" version="1065353216">He sulks, to no end. With the ideograms traded and mastered, the Conglomerate's own enrichment approaches.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049371" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, the Empire's interested too. But, those &quot;ideograms&quot; the Chevin mentioned... I can look into that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049382" id2="17" version="1065353216">Listen. Please, don't give those items to the Chevin. Place them in Republic custody; I have a dead drop that's secure. But we can't let them fall into Chevin hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="1049387" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need to complete my investigation. If my suspicions are right... I'll keep you informed.</text>
