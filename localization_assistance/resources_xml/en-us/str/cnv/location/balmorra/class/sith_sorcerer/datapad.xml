		<text bitflag="321" id1="717270" id2="17" version="1065353216">[The terminal shows a log of the work done on the Colicoids and the toxic waste.]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="717272" id2="17" version="1065353216">...Progress on the experiments is not going without a hitch, but we seem to have overcome the initial obstacles we faced when we began.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="717274" id2="17" version="1065353216">Recently, Team Five reported that the subjects responded positively to the waste from the hazard vault.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="717276" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our only remaining concern is that the casualty rate seems to have gone up in this round of testing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="717278" id2="17" version="1065353216">So far, we've lost two of our best scientists and three research assistants. At this rate, we almost can't afford to be successful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="717280" id2="17" version="1065353216">At any rate, I have recorded the formula for the chemical compound that has thus far produced the best results.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="717282" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have also diagrammed its structure and how I believe it interacts with the Colicoid cell structure and the toxic waste.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="717284" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hopefully, we will be able to figure out the cause of the rise in the subjects' ferocity and eliminate casualties from here forward....</text>
