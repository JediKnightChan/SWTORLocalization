		<text bitflag="321" id1="554373" id2="17" version="1065353216">By order of Darth Lachris, revered governor of Imperial Balmorra, champion of the siege of Coruscant. Due to the previous governor's incompetence, the resistance has managed to establish a factory for the production of chemical weapons near the toxic waste pools.

They are using the toxic waste to produce bombs to poison Imperial forces. The bombs are guarded by the resistance's top marksmen. Previous attempts to take back the factory and dismantle the bombs resulted in the annihilation of two crack commando teams.

Dismantle the bombs. Eliminate the resistance. The wealth and gratitude of your Empire will be at your disposal.</text>
