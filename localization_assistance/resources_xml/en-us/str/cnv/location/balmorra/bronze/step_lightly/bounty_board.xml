Resistance forces outside Sobrik have ambushed four dewback convoys sent to the Troida Military Workshop within the last week, with substantial loss of personnel and materials.

Imperial Intelligence's tireless efforts have revealed seismic sensors, hidden throughout the road to Troida. These sensors allow the resistance to track dewback convoys, and avoid our armored walker patrols.

This continued insurrection will not be tolerated. Volunteers are sought to set off the seismic sensors, destroy the ambushers and bring the power cores to the Troida Military Workshop for study. Consider any resistance fighter who protects these sensors to be under sentence of death. Reward offered.</text>
