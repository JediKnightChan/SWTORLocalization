Rodian, Chagrian and Kel Dor mercenary forces, decorated Republic war heroes, all are well coordinated and have taken up a position near the AA guns outside of the Balmorran Arms Factory. Their snipers have been responsible for 304 Imperial casualties and the destruction of over fifty Imperial aircraft to date. 

Reward offered for anyone who will crush the alien rebels and liberate the AA guns.</text>
