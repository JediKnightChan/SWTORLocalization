		<text bitflag="321" id1="554364" id2="17" version="1065353216">By order of Darth Lachris, revered governor of Imperial Balmorra, champion of the siege of Coruscant. In spite of the Empire's glorious victory at Balmorran Arms, the battle has not been won.

The Republic's top tactician, field commander and gunner have regrouped the scattered resistance forces and are preparing a fresh assault on Imperial Balmorra!

The Jedi Noth Armin, Sergeant Tove Weylan and the mercenary Korin Norrus have been coordinating strikes against Imperial ships and have so far brought down three Imperial squadrons.

Eliminate them and show the resistance the futility of their cause. The wealth and gratitude of your Empire will be at your disposal.</text>
