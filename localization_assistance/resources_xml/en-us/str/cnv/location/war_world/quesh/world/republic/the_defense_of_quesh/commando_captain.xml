		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597728" id2="17" version="1065353216">That Imperial slimeball got what he deserved. Good riddance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597729" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll escort our guest to his holding cell myself. You'd better meet the general.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597730" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're right behind you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597735" id2="17" version="1065353216">You made it! We thought the major was kidding when he told us you were taking the front by yourselves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597736" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad to see you made it through in one piece, Master Jedi!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597737" id2="17" version="1065353216">Captain! Good to see you! I wasn't sure that even Havoc Squad could plow through the guards at the front and come out alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597739" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't believe you survived that gauntlet! Are you made of durasteel?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597740" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm impressed. I didn't think anyone could make a frontal assault on this place.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597743" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad you made it through. The front doors were brutal. We lost a lot of good men.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597745" id2="17" version="1065353216">The front entrance is secured, Master Jedi. My squad took a beating--we lost some good men, but we're ready to fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597747" id2="17" version="1065353216">Red Squad reporting for duty, Captain. We took a pounding coming through the front, but we're ready for some payback.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597749" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad you made it! Our squad took heavy casualties, but we're ready for action.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597751" id2="17" version="1065353216">You made it! Good! We lost some of our people in the assault on the doors. My squad's itching to make some Imperials pay.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597753" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's bound to be trouble up ahead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597754" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take point. Let's go find Moff Dracen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="597754" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stay behind me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597755" id2="17" version="1065353216">No need for alarm, Captain. Just follow me, and we'll be fine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="597755" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force is with us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597756" id2="17" version="1065353216">Havoc Squad deals with worse than this before breakfast every day. Let's get moving.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="597756" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not that bad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597757" id2="17" version="1065353216">Story of my life. Always someone lurking, waiting to kill you. You get used to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="597757" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's always trouble ahead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="597758" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's fight some Imperials.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="597759" id2="17" version="1065353216">You heard the order, men! Move out!</text>
