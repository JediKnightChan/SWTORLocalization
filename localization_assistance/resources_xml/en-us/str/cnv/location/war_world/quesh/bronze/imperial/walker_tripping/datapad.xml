Republic walkers have been disrupting mining operations. Bravo Team is ordered to take position over the bridge, and plant the proximity explosives provided at the checkpoints along the walker route. 

The explosives are calibrated to cripple the walker convoy as it passes. Eliminate any opposition, and report via holocom when the mission is complete. Good luck.</text>
