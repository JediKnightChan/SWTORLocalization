		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71335" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for your assistance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71337" id2="17" version="1065353216">The crane has been destroyed, Sergeant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71338" id2="17" version="1065353216">So I've heard. I've been listening in on the Republic's comm channels... they're furious at the loss. You must have done some serious damage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71339" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excellent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71340" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was nothing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71341" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71342" id2="17" version="1065353216">This was a waste of my time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71343" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... yes, of course. As you wish.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71345" id2="17" version="1065353216">This was a waste of my skills.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71346" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you would prefer not to accept further contracts, that's your business.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71348" id2="17" version="1065353216">It seems the crane was intended to build a powerful shield generator that would have made attacks on the Republic's operation impossible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71350" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should begin scouting for further targets. Thank you for your help--without you, our entire mission here might have been dragged to a halt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71352" id2="17" version="1065353216">Security around the crane is extensive. Be wary.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71353" id2="17" version="1065353216">All of that security just for a blasted crane... it doesn't make sense....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71354" id2="17" version="1065353216">Problems, Sergeant?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71355" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh! Uh... yes, my lord, I have encountered a surprising amount of resistance in my assigned task.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71357" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, ahem--agent. Yes, I'm afraid I've run into an unusual amount of opposition in my current assignment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71359" id2="17" version="1065353216">Regrettably, yes. The enemy is presenting a far greater challenge than I'd anticipated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71361" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm charged with organizing raids against the Republic's mining efforts. We strike targets of opportunity to slow their progress and drive them to retaliate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71363" id2="17" version="1065353216">They recently constructed a large crane that I thought would make a perfect target. I sent a team, but security was triple the expected strength--my soldiers were slaughtered.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71364" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did you come to misjudge your enemy, Sergeant?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71364" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why the mistake?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71365" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps determining the enemy's security first would've been the wiser move?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71365" id2="17" version="1065353216">Didn't you check first?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71366" id2="17" version="1065353216">My... reconnaissance was clearly not as thorough as it should've been. A mistake I will absolutely not repeat, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71368" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like you should start hiring out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71368" id2="17" version="1065353216">Need a professional?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71369" id2="17" version="1065353216">That may be my only option, now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71371" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should've gathered more intelligence, Sergeant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71371" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sloppy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71372" id2="17" version="1065353216">I had thought my reconnaissance was thorough, but that was clearly not the case. A mistake I won't repeat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71374" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why would security be so heavy?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71374" id2="17" version="1065353216">All of that for a crane?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71375" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why should I care?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71376" id2="17" version="1065353216">Clearly, the crane is a very important part of the Republic's operations--far more than we'd first suspected.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71378" id2="17" version="1065353216">The crane needs to be destroyed--and the Republic punished. But I just don't have the manpower to go up against so much security.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71379" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll deal with this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71380" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's... very generous of you. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71382" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose I could help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71383" id2="17" version="1065353216">I feared I would never see this done. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71385" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll find the crane at these coordinates. Good hunting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="71387" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too bad. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71388" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps unit twelve could send reinforcements... no, no....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="71390" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll crush these Republic fools yet.</text>
