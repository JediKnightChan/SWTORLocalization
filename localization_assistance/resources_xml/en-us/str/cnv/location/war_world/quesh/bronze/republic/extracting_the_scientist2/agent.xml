		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70917" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is Meldo. Doctor Orlian's here. We're leaving the facility now. I'll file my report with Suria once we're at the safe house.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70921" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bring Doctor Orlian to the rendezvous point, and I'll get him to safety.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="70924" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agent Meldo? Your boss sent me to meet with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70925" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should have known Suria would start to freak out if I didn't file my reports.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70927" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everything's got to be exactly by the book with her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="70928" id2="17" version="1065353216">She seems a little obsessed with rules and regulations.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="70928" id2="17" version="1065353216">I noticed that.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70929" id2="17" version="1065353216">You got that right. She has no idea how to improvise or adapt. Makes it tough to run an effective field operation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="70931" id2="17" version="1065353216">Isn't that a good thing?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70932" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rules and regulations don't always work too well in the field. A good agent has to know how to roll with the punches.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="70934" id2="17" version="1065353216">We were worried your cover was blown.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="70934" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why haven't you kept in touch?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70935" id2="17" version="1065353216">Security here is tighter than we expected. The Imps are watching everyone, including me and Doctor Orlian.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70937" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was waiting for the right time to approach him. Should have known Suria would end up sticking her nose in if I took too long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="70938" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you stopped filing reports, she got worried.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="70938" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can you blame her?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70939" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was worried about the mission, not me. She's got to learn to trust her agents.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="70941" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like you have everything under control here after all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="70941" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you want me to go?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70942" id2="17" version="1065353216">Things were moving along slowly but surely.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70944" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now that you're here, though, I might as well make use of your talents. Improvise and adapt, I say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="70946" id2="17" version="1065353216">The time for waiting is over.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70947" id2="17" version="1065353216">Actually, that's not a bad idea. Maybe we can wrap this up sooner than I originally planned. Improvise and adapt, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70949" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doctor Orlian is in the lab. Bring him here to the rendezvous, and I'll make sure he gets to one of our SIS safe houses.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="70953" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't talk to you right now.</text>
