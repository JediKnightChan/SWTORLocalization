		<text bitflag="321" id1="100618" id2="17" version="1065353216">First Nerrik. Then Jak, then Haze. Now Ford. I don't think I can take it anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100620" id2="17" version="1065353216">I really think Paal is trying to kill me. He said it was the Sand People who got Haze and Jak, but he's lying.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100622" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can tell. He killed them while they slept. Haze, because he had the artifact. Jak, because he accused Paal of killing Haze.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100624" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I hadn't seen the Sand People kill Ford and Nerrik with my own eyes, I'd think it was all Paal.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100626" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just hope he doesn't find this, or I'm next. We plan to head east in the morning. I hope I live to see it.</text>
