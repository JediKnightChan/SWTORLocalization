		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613181" id2="17" version="1065353216">I see you've made it to Tatooine. Not the most luxurious destination, but trust me--the artifact is close.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613183" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll need to find the pirate Andronikos Revel. He should be quite familiar with this piece.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613184" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who is this Andronikos Revel and what's his interest in Sith artifacts?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613184" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613185" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was once a pirate, and the artifact was once a prize.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613187" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you mean he has the artifact?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613187" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you implying?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613188" id2="17" version="1065353216">Quite the contrary.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613190" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've always wanted to meet a real pirate!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613190" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh boy! A pirate!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613191" id2="17" version="1065353216">Careful. Andronikos Revel's reputation, while never playful, is even less so now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613193" id2="17" version="1065353216">He stole the artifact out of some Sith ruins, but when his crew mutinied, they took it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613195" id2="17" version="1065353216">I sent a cruiser to recover the artifact, but all they found was Andronikos in an escape pod, half-mad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613197" id2="17" version="1065353216">We let him stew for a while in Imperial prison, and then released him. He's been hunting his crew down ever since, and we've been watching.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613198" id2="17" version="1065353216">It sounds like you have this whole situation under control.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613198" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why am I here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613199" id2="17" version="1065353216">Andronikos doesn't know he's been our bloodhound for the last year. He probably doesn't remember or care about the artifact.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613201" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does this Andronikos know you're using him to get to the artifact?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613201" id2="17" version="1065353216">So he's your hound.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613202" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does it matter? He gets what he wants - revenge - and you and I get what we want. The artifact.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613204" id2="17" version="1065353216">What does he do when he finds them?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613204" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hunting them?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613205" id2="17" version="1065353216">A blaster bolt to the head, a knife to the throat. Whatever strikes his mood.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613207" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's never lingered longer than it takes to kill, but Tatooine is different. It's been weeks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613209" id2="17" version="1065353216">I believe Andronikos has found the leader of the mutiny, and with him, the artifact. Find Andronikos and you'll find a clear course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613210" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why not wait for him to make his move and capture him again?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613210" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why not lay a trap?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613211" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no guarantee he will take the artifact if he finds it or that we will know he has made his move.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613213" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where can I find Andronikos?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613214" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know precisely.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="613216" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613217" id2="17" version="1065353216">Andronikos must have come through the spaceport at some point. Start with the shipmaster.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="613219" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck, apprentice. And remember, every piece draws you closer to your full potential.</text>
