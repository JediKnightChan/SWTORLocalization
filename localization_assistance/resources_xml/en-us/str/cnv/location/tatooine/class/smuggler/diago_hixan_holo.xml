		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611146" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nok Drayen... Nok Drayen... that's all I hear. &quot;What was it like to fight Nok Drayen?&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611148" id2="17" version="1065353216">The next time some fool asks me that, I'll bury this holorecording in his forehead and play it back for the survivors.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611150" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nok Drayen was never a true gangster--not like me. He just pretended.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611152" id2="17" version="1065353216">People think I fought him because he was more successful. Because he made me &quot;number two.&quot; Because he stole my wife. Lies!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611154" id2="17" version="1065353216">I fought him because he was no more a gangster than I'm a Senator.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611156" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nok was a con artist. The whole underworld was his mark. He was using us for... something. Don't know what.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611158" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I do know he never gave a damn about being &quot;King of the Underworld.&quot; It was all just a game.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611160" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least that pile of filth is finally dead. I raided his storehouse just to be sure. He never came.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611162" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm still alive, and he's not. I won.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="611164" id2="17" version="1065353216">You hear that, Nok? I won!</text>
