		<text bitflag="321" id1="100630" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's all over now. Paal's gone raving mad. He accused Bekis of trying to kill him at the last campsite and shot him.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100632" id2="17" version="1065353216">We were already deep into Sand People territory at the time, so the blaster shot drew all kinds of unwanted attention.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100634" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those beasts had us on the run for three days. Out of the fifteen of us that started, there's only me and Paal left.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100636" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now Paal's talking about taking the artifact to the Sand People's camp to the north as a &quot;peace offering.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100638" id2="17" version="1065353216">I tried to tell him there's no way we'll walk away from those beasts' camp alive, but he wouldn't listen.</text>
