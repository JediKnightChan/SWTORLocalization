		<text bitflag="321" id1="100602" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've been in this desert three days now.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100604" id2="17" version="1065353216">About midday the day we left, Nerrik tried to turn back but Haze would have none of it. We couldn't have Nerrik telling Wilkes.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100606" id2="17" version="1065353216">We forced Nerrik to continue at gunpoint. At nightfall, we all got together to talk about what to do about Nerrik.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100608" id2="17" version="1065353216">Haze wanted to shoot him. But Haze wants to shoot everyone. But then the Sand People attacked and took care of Nerrik for us.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100610" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ever since that first night, we've kept a watch to warn us if the Sand People attack.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100612" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not that it does any good. Without the lights from town, you can't see anything in the desert at night.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="100614" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tomorrow, if we're still alive, we plan to head north.</text>
