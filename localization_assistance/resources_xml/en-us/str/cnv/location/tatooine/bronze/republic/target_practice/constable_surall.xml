		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615166" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks again! You see any more Sand People, you shoot them in the face for me, will you?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615169" id2="17" version="1065353216">Would you look at all this? I should have asked you to bring me back a Sarlacc while you were at it!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615171" id2="17" version="1065353216">You lot are practically a small army!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615173" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're in your debt, Master Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615175" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's some fine work, soldier.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615177" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do good work, friend.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615179" id2="17" version="1065353216">That ought to make the Sand People think twice about attacking travelers. At least for a while.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="615180" id2="17" version="1065353216">There are plenty more Sand People out there. This probably isn't over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615180" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stay alert.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615181" id2="17" version="1065353216">It never is.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615183" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was my pleasure.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615184" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're lucky you came by.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615186" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll let you get back to work.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615187" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. A lot of farmers and miners owe you their lives.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615189" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck out there. Bring me back whatever rifles those Sand People are carrying.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615192" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me guess, you're here to complain about the Sand People, right? Took a shot at you?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615194" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not the first traveler they've attacked, and you won't be the last either. You're lucky you're in one piece.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615196" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll tell you what I tell everyone: There's nothing I can do. Too many of them and not enough of me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615202" id2="17" version="1065353216">This sounds like my specialty.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615203" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's mighty kind of you to offer, friend. Here's hoping you don't get shot for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615205" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hadn't heard anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615206" id2="17" version="1065353216">You mean you didn't get shot at? Well, you're one of the lucky ones, then.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615208" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sand People are acting more territorial than usual, even for Sand People. Crazy natives are shooting everything that crosses the wastes.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615210" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want to help? Get those rifles away from them. That'd save me a world of trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="615211" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not sure why you'd want a bunch of Sand People's guns. You a collector?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615211" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you want them for?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615212" id2="17" version="1065353216">Helps me sleep better at night. Every rifle you take from them is one less they can shoot me with.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615214" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be patient. I'll return soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615215" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck to you, Master Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615217" id2="17" version="1065353216">I foresee no difficulty there.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615218" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a lot more confident than I am. Here's hoping things go as smooth as you think.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615220" id2="17" version="1065353216">Piece of cake.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615221" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wish you luck, soldier.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615223" id2="17" version="1065353216">There some kind of reward?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615224" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll scrounge up some sort of payment for you, if you decide to help out.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615226" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be here to take those rifles off your hands. Go bust some heads!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not my concern. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615229" id2="17" version="1065353216">Figured that out already, thanks.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615231" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm busy right now. You're going to have to come back when things settle down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="757877" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's a Sand Person?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="757878" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh? The Sand People... they're native to the desert, savage and bloodthirsty. Can't talk to them--they murder any outsiders they find.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="757880" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tribes don't have a lot of tech, but they're good at scavenging and they've been on the offensive lately.</text>
