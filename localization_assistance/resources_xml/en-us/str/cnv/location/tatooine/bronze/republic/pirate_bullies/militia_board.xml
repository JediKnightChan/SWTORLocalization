Alerting all responsible citizens. Posted: Sorin Schaff, the citizens' militia's chief backer, is being held captive in his own home by Twin Suns pirates.

The pirates' leader, Braigin Helk, has proved too much for militia forces. We request the help of any and all combat-trained professionals to defeat Helk and liberate the homestead.

Coordinates provided. The Citizens' Militia thanks you for your support.

&quot;Vigilance, community, defense.&quot;</text>
