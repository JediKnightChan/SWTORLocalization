		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615561" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, well. Look at the incredible job I've done clearing out those gangsters. Mayor Martik's gonna be mighty generous with his rewards....</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="615563" id2="17" version="1065353216">Course, he'll be very disappointed to hear that you all couldn't resist stealing his ore and selling it on the black market.</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="615565" id2="17" version="1065353216">Course, he'll be appalled to hear a Jedi like yourself couldn't keep from fleeing with the merchandise.</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="615567" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I don't think he'll be even a little surprised to hear you couldn't resist running off with his merchandise.</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="615569" id2="17" version="1065353216">Course, he'll be a mite stung to hear that such an upstanding citizen took off with his ore.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615571" id2="17" version="1065353216">But at least he'll know I held up my end of the bargain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="615572" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am a Jedi. No one would take your word over mine!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615572" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your greed blinds you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="615573" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you think you have the credibility it would take to frame a Jedi?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615573" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is unwise.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615574" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dead Jedi are pretty easy to frame.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="615576" id2="17" version="1065353216">I cleared out those thugs while you sat on your rump. You can't change that now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615576" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not taking my credit.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615577" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sure I can. Long as no one's around to contradict me....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="615579" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of all the lazy, rotten, underhanded schemes.... Why didn't I think of that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615579" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want to take my credit?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615580" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha! I like you. Too bad I can't have you running around telling people I'm a liar.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615582" id2="17" version="1065353216">Huh?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615583" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm talking about how you came blundering in after I had driven off the Twin Suns, and stole the merchandise I was going to return to Mayor Martik.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615585" id2="17" version="1065353216">My boys'll get that wrapped up later.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615587" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I'm gonna make sure nobody can contradict that story...</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="615589" id2="17" version="1065353216">You won't get away with that.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615590" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's assuming you'll be alive....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="615592" id2="17" version="1065353216">My boys'll back me up. I was the one who single-handedly cleared the Twin Suns from this mine, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="615596" id2="17" version="1065353216">What the--? Oh, blast it! Boys! There's another of them Twin Suns droids here! Hurry!</text>
