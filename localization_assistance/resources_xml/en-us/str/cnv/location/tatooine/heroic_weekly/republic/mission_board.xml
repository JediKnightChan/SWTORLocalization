By order of Mayor Airen and the Citizens' Militia--Geonosian attacks on Tatooine farmers and settlements have grown bold.

The Geonosians are highly coordinated, and multiple swarms are often involved in the raids. We have heard their coded signals in the night, but we are unable to interpret them.

The signals originate at their main camp. Find their signal devices, obtain the code, and bring it to Captain Sabha of the militia.
