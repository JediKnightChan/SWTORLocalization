		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606185" id2="17" version="1065353216">You took out Takor the Terrible. And I knew you first!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606186" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're at peace now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606189" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, blot the blasted suns from the sky! You took him out. The terror of Tatooine. I just--how?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606190" id2="17" version="1065353216">No mere bandit can stand against the Force.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606190" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force was with me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606191" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, remind me not to get you mad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606193" id2="17" version="1065353216">A brute like that will never stand against a well-executed assault.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606193" id2="17" version="1065353216">Superior tactics.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606194" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you say so. My grasp of tactics never went much past &quot;charge.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606196" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've just got a habit of turning up on the right end of the blaster, you know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606196" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sheer dumb luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606197" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the kind of habit you don't want to break.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606199" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can do far more together than any of us alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606199" id2="17" version="1065353216">Teamwork.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606200" id2="17" version="1065353216">Without breaking a sweat.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606201" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I bow to you and whoever taught you besides.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606203" id2="17" version="1065353216">And my boys? Are they at peace?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606204" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hear Takor the Terrible's down a few boys of his own, now. There'll be some toasts to that tonight, I tell you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606206" id2="17" version="1065353216">And our lads? They get their taste of mercy?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606207" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well? I don't get no news from the afterlife, you know. Did you do it? Are our boys at peace?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606208" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hopefully we've spared them before they suffered too much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606208" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're dead now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606209" id2="17" version="1065353216">One day of torture like that is too long, still, it's better than a thousand years.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606211" id2="17" version="1065353216">I gave my word. Don't doubt me now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606211" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't question me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606212" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just wanted to hear it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606214" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who can tell?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606215" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sure, from here, it's hard to see the difference between tortured and dead. But if it was you, you'd sure want someone to try.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606217" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like to think they could hear that Gamorrean monster screaming right before they passed.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606218" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like to think they're smiling somewhere now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606220" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wish we had you here for permanent. We'd get a few more enlisting if they knew someone like you had their backs.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606222" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, go if you want to, then. Would you want to be kept waiting inside something's stomach?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606223" id2="17" version="1065353216">People are going soft here. Look around--not one of these idiots here has stepped forward to join the militia to defend our towns.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606225" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can you believe it? Not a bleeding one.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606227" id2="17" version="1065353216">Course, why would you fight, when all it buys you is an empty grave? When you know no one's coming back for the corpses?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whose corpses? Did someone die?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Corpses?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606229" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fifteen boys, killed by that sadistic Gamorrean warlord Takor the Terrible and not one man stands up to lead the rescue.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606231" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you saying?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606232" id2="17" version="1065353216">Find some other old-timer if you're going to start moaning about &quot;them young 'uns.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606232" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't have time for this.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606233" id2="17" version="1065353216">An old-timer, huh? Let me tell you, I got more scars than wrinkles. And this is serious.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606235" id2="17" version="1065353216">We lost a fifteen-man patrol yesterday to that sadistic Gamorrean warlord Takor the Terrible, and no one wants to lead the rescue.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606237" id2="17" version="1065353216">By now, Takor's likely fed 'em to the Sarlacc--every Tatooinian's worst nightmare.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606239" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gaping maw in the ground, surrounded by teeth and tentacles. Takor tosses in enemies, live, and the Sarlacc digests them for a thousand years. A long, painful death.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606240" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would not wish such a horrific fate on anyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606240" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a horror story.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606241" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd like to see you stick that big glow rod right down the beast's throat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606243" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would not stand aside while men suffer needlessly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606243" id2="17" version="1065353216">Would you accept outside aid?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606244" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then get on out there, Master Jedi. Because our boys need a friend like you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606246" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Leave no man behind.&quot; That's the cornerstone of any good military.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606246" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your friends deserve better.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606247" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right you are, sir. That's what I been trying to tell these clodheads.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606249" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm available, but I have a strong aversion to being fed to anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606249" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you asking for help?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606250" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, yeah. You don't want to get in the Sarlacc, let me tell you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606252" id2="17" version="1065353216">What is this thing?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606252" id2="17" version="1065353216">A thousand years?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606253" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one really knows. It lives under the sands, center of Takor's territory. All anyone's ever seen is the mouth.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606255" id2="17" version="1065353216">They say if it swallows you, it's got a way to keep you alive and suffering the whole time. You feel every scrap of flesh worn away.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606257" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were stuck in there, you'd want someone to come along and grant you mercy, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606258" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're asking me to kill this warlord, just say so.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606258" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you want Takor dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606259" id2="17" version="1065353216">Might as well say you'll kill the desert itself! He's that big. Three meters at the shoulder and solid muscle.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606261" id2="17" version="1065353216">And mean as a drunk rancor. The folks he doesn't give the Sarlacc come back with tongues cut out, no fingers.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606263" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nah, all I want is help for my boys. A little mercy, you know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606264" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, you want me to rescue them?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606264" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine. I'll help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606265" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you barking mad? No one comes out of a Sarlacc. I just want to end the misery, let them go easy into that dark night and all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="606267" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's the going rate for mercy on this planet?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606267" id2="17" version="1065353216">Depends on the price.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606268" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do I look like a bank? You want to profit off this, take whatever riches the warlord's piled up out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606270" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want to help our boys, drop these grenades in the Sarlacc's mouth. They'll poison anything left alive in there--a painless death.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606272" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I wouldn't cry if you put some hurt on Takor's men along the way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="606274" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget it. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606275" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think I was asking for something? We don't need no outside help. We on Tatooine!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="606277" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kids these days....</text>
