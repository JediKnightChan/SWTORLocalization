		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609017" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doctor Soprin, here. We've finished our initial catalog of the cave artifacts, which register as over twenty thousand years old.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609019" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd think that would narrow down the possible creators, wouldn't you? There weren't many societies capable of space travel in that period.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609021" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I can't find any society or species that fits these criteria. Even Gree technology isn't comparable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609023" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyway, Doctor Lerek and I will study the primary device and assign lesser relics to the others to keep them busy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609025" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hopefully, someone will find something useful. Czerka's going to make a fortune off this stuff if we can figure it out. End log.</text>
