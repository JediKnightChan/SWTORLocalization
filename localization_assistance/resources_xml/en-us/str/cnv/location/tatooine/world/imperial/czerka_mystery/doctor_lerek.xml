		<text bitflag="1345" id1="608999" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want my concerns on the record before more people get hurt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609001" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm worried about the device. Its energy readings keep fluctuating, and it appears to be trying to link with the lesser artifacts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609003" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think it's a weapon, maybe a bomb. Soprin's theory about it being a Gree Enclave creation are inane.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609005" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've already got evidence of an ancient alien civilization visiting Tatooine--and they weren't Gree. We've seen similar technology in the Kashyyyk Shadowlands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609007" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure the Infinite Empire is tied to the device's origins, no matter what anyone says. And I'm tired of being ignored.</text>
