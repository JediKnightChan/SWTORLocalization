		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609122" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is Captain Golah, Reclamation Service Outpost 701. It's good to see you, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609124" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is Captain Golah, Reclamation Service Outpost 701. It's good to see you again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609126" id2="17" version="1065353216">My team's still searching for the Czerka base, but we've hit a snag that, frankly, we can't handle ourselves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609127" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've solved your problems before. I can do it again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609127" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then it's fortunate I'm here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609128" id2="17" version="1065353216">Give me your report.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609129" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is there anything your team can handle?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609129" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're all hopeless.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609130" id2="17" version="1065353216">My team's been through fire and misery. They're survivors--but they're not soldiers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609132" id2="17" version="1065353216">After you left for the Jawas, Lord Silthar had a vision--something about the natives, the &quot;Sand People.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609134" id2="17" version="1065353216">He flew a speeder into the Dune Sea, but we lost the tracking signal in an... energy storm. Silthar was summoning lightning.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609135" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why would Silthar go out there alone?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609135" id2="17" version="1065353216">What was he doing?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609136" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lord Silthar can summon lightning?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609136" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lightning?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609137" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lord Silthar is a powerful Sith. We've seen him use the Force before, but only ever in desperate circumstances.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609139" id2="17" version="1065353216">Darth Silthar is a Sith Lord. You needn't worry about his safety.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609139" id2="17" version="1065353216">He can handle himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609140" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's what I told the others. But Silthar wouldn't call on that much power unless he was desperate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609142" id2="17" version="1065353216">By this time, your Darth is some animal's lunch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609142" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too late for him now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609143" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't believe that. Maybe he's hurt--but he's not dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609145" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lord Silthar was following a dream. The same way he found the lost temple of Ziost and the crystal caves of Molavar.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609147" id2="17" version="1065353216">He told me the Sand People and their spirit guides were the key. He was looking for... some sort of compass.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609148" id2="17" version="1065353216">The natives. What are they? What could they do to Silthar?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609148" id2="17" version="1065353216">About these Sand People....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609149" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know. They're savages. Still... I wouldn't think they could kill him alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609151" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me handle this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609152" id2="17" version="1065353216">If he can't take the heat, he shouldn't have left the base.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="609152" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's his problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609153" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe. But at the very least, we need to know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609155" id2="17" version="1065353216">Find the spirit guides and find him. When you have answers, come to our forward outpost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="609157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Otherwise... I don't know how this mission can succeed.</text>
