		<text bitflag="321" id1="682010" id2="17" version="1065353216">By order of Darth Mekhis of the Dark Council. Darth Hadra has over-stepped her bounds for the last time! Believing all the territory of Dromund Kaas to be hers, and all within it, she claims power that belongs to the Emperor alone.

Her servants have laid claim to a discovery of monumental significance to the Sith Empire. It belongs not to her alone, but to all the Empire. It falls to every loyal citizen and ally of the Empire to oppose her forces, and defeat her minion and apprentice, Lord Arosh, whom she has sent in her stead. Force her to re-think her folly and surrender her claim. Darth Mekhis, esteemed member of the Dark Council, will see to your reward.</text>
