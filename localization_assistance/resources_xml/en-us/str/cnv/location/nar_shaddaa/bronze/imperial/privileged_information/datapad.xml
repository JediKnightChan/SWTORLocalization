To all Imperial staff and allies: Please note the &quot;outreach&quot; program in the Duros Sector has been met with mixed success. Several leaders of rebel groups have been uncovered living among the refugees and have been eliminated, but much of the general populace is no longer tolerant of our activities here.

In other words, our cover has been blown. All combat-ready personnel are asked to identify themselves and check in upon arrival in the district--we will be able to use your assistance.</text>
