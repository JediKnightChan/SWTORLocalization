Despite a generous outreach program to the Duros Sector's impoverished citizens, armed anti-Empire militants have begun a campaign of terror against our people. Cowardly saboteurs have captured astromech droids and armed the units with explosives. The droids are then programmed to detonate in the presence of our benevolent Imperial officials.

This unwarranted aggression must not stand. The Emperor commands that these anti-Empire forces and their sabotage droids be eliminated immediately, so that peace is restored to the Duros Sector.</text>

BOUNTY LISTING #X489J2

Several Jedi Knights have invaded this sector and are lending support to anti-Empire rioters. Loyal servants of the Emperor are encouraged to confront these extremists and their meddling Republic allies. Eliminate them with extreme prejudice.

Reward will be delivered upon verification that the Jedi at key coordinates have all been neutralized.</text>
