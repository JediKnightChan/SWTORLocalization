CITIZEN TRAVEL ADVISORY

To all Republic citizens in the Red Light Sector: Be advised the Gauntlet criminal gang has set up a death duel tournament in the back alleys. Poor refugees are running the gang's ordeal for credit rewards. The Gauntlet is broadcasting holos of these fights. No refugee has survived to collect a prize.

The Hutt Cartel refuses to intervene in this despicable &quot;entertainment.&quot; All tourists should avoid the area, but trained Republic agents are encouraged to end the Gauntlet's activities by destroying its holorecording equipment and driving off the gangsters.</text>
