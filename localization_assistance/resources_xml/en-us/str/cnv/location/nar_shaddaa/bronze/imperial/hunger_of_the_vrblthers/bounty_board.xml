The Cartel seeks combat-worthy individuals who value Hutt generosity! A large pack of savage vrblthers has infested Network Access. These deadly predators are wreaking havoc at the power station. Trillions of important data files are at risk. The entire HoloNet itself may cease functioning!

The Cartel will lavishly reward any who eradicate the vrblthers and repair the damage before it is too late. Please be advised, several security teams have indicated the presence of unusually large vrblther pack elders. Additional information is unavailable, as the security teams have since disappeared.</text>
