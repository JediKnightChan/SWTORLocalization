		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170220" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't let Kesler rot in some Imperial prison.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="170222" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got Kesler's report.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170223" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then... Kesler's alive? And this data--thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170225" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll have our people go over his findings at once. Then I'll see about getting him back.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170227" id2="17" version="1065353216">Head to Shadow Town. Find Kesler and his report.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excuse me. Agent Alys, SIS. I came to Shadow Town looking for someone. Goes by Kesler. He's--he was my partner.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170230" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was undercover, investigating the Labor Alliance's operations on Nar Shaddaa.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170232" id2="17" version="1065353216">Two weeks ago he contacted me, said he'd been compromised. Promised he'd transmit his report, but... nothing. Now he's MIA.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="170233" id2="17" version="1065353216">Snooping on slavers is dangerous business.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="170233" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a gutsy assignment.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170234" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everything we do is dangerous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="170236" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's been captured?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170237" id2="17" version="1065353216">I--yes. Kesler is one of our top agents. He wouldn't go this long without reporting in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="170239" id2="17" version="1065353216">What kind of information was in Kesler's report?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="170239" id2="17" version="1065353216">What was he investigating?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170240" id2="17" version="1065353216">Names, places, accounts of goods delivered and received. Inside info on the Labor Alliance's dealings with the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170242" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kesler knew his cover was blown, but he didn't hit any of our drop points. Which means he may still have his report.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170244" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got a massive sting operation in the works. Its success hinges on Kesler's findings. We need someone to bring back that report.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="170245" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't want to free Kesler?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="170245" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about your partner?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170246" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course I--look, if Kesler is alive inside that place, it means cranial bombs. No easy escape.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="170248" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leave it to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170249" id2="17" version="1065353216">I--thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170251" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just see if he's in Shadow Town, and bring back his report if you find him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170253" id2="17" version="1065353216">And please... let him know I haven't forgotten about him. I will come for him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="170255" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not me. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170256" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a long shot anyway....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="170258" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blasted fool. Should've gotten out when he had the chance.</text>
