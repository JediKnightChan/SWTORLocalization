		<text bitflag="1345" id1="656952" id2="17" version="1065353216">Clan Sharratt issues a challenge to the Republic's so-called champions. If you're warrior enough to face the greatest Mandalorian clan on Nar Shaddaa, come to our coordinates. We promise a warm welcome, but only if you come quickly.

We have just sipped upon the finest combat stims on Nar Shaddaa, and we're feeling especially good right now. We want a worthy challenge. If you won't come to us, we'll just have to start torching Republic buildings until we find something better to amuse us.
