CLEARANCE APPROVED

The Strategic Information Service has an ultraviolet-level mission requiring immediate action. The Empire's chief engineers have arrived to upgrade Shadow Town's cranial explosives technology. This is a rare opportunity to exploit the enemy's vulnerability.

If Republic scientists can examine the cranial device's technical schematics, they could learn how to safely deactivate the explosives detonator. This would allow SIS agents to extract prisoners from Shadow Town. Proceed to the Shadow Town prison control center, neutralize resistance and recover the schematics.
