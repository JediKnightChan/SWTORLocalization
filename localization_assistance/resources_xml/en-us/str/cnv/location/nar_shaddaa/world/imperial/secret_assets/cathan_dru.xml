		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650137" id2="17" version="1065353216">We should hear back from the weapons manufacturers soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650138" id2="17" version="1065353216">You survived! Tell me--was I right? Did you find any wonderfully incriminating evidence?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650139" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you said those mercenaries were tough?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650139" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course I survived.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650140" id2="17" version="1065353216">They are--or should I say were? Obviously, your reputation for dealing out death is well-deserved. Thank you for your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650142" id2="17" version="1065353216">I found a few things those mercenaries wouldn't let go of without a fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650142" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think so.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650143" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure. The Republic pays well to keep their dirty little secrets.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650145" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those mercs were tough.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650146" id2="17" version="1065353216">I admit I was a bit worried, but obviously your reputation for dealing out death is well-deserved.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650148" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've already been in touch with my Imperial contacts. They're eager to see what the vault kept hidden.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650150" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd better get a move on. There's a possibility Revaak might call in reinforcements.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650151" id2="17" version="1065353216">You didn't complete the job, so you don't get the money.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650153" id2="17" version="1065353216">You didn't tell me the vault was guarded by Revaak and his mercs. I lost two of my best men.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650155" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then obviously I misjudged your expertise. Now please leave.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perfect! Just the group I'm looking for! I take it you overheard my little problem?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650158" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord! Your reputation precedes you. And may I say, it wholly fails to do you credit. I take it you overheard my little... disagreement?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650159" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah--just the sort I need to see. Your reputation precedes you, hunter. Did you overhear my problem?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650160" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sir! Greetings to you. I've heard about you, but I never thought I'd have the honor... I take it you overheard my little disagreement?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650161" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think people in the next sector overheard.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650161" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was hard not to.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650162" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, Arak can be a little... excitable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650164" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like someone messed up big time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650164" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're in real trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650165" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't know the half of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650167" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your petty problems don't interest me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650167" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why would I bother listening?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650168" id2="17" version="1065353216">You stick to your own business. I like that.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650170" id2="17" version="1065353216">My name is Cathan Dru. It's my job to... pass along information that might benefit the Empire. If you know what I mean.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650172" id2="17" version="1065353216">I recently came across a corporate vault the Republic desperately needs to keep secret. Arak was supposed to bring me its contents.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650173" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me guess--he talked big but couldn't deliver.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650173" id2="17" version="1065353216">I take it he failed.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650174" id2="17" version="1065353216">You could say that. We didn't know the vault was guarded by Revaak and his mercenaries. They... didn't take kindly to Arak's attack.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650176" id2="17" version="1065353216">What is the Republic so desperate to keep hidden?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650176" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's in the vault?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650177" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do I look interested to you?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650178" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm hoping you could do what Arak couldn't.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650180" id2="17" version="1065353216">The vault contains documents from companies that handle the Republic's weapons programs--evidence of aborted experiments, biological accidents, minutes of secret meetings.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650182" id2="17" version="1065353216">With that evidence, we could blackmail the manufacturers to work for us instead of the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650184" id2="17" version="1065353216">It would get the Empire legions of new droids and ships. Perhaps a venture worth your time?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650185" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those who aid the Republic will fall before my hand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650185" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650186" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll squeeze those corporations until they crumble into dust.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650186" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650187" id2="17" version="1065353216">Mercenaries won't deter me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650187" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nothing could be simpler.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650188" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I'll do it with one hand tied behind my back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650188" id2="17" version="1065353216">No problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650189" id2="17" version="1065353216">How tough are these mercs?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650190" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revaak's men are the toughest mercs on the planet. They'll outnumber you--and the vault's defenses are also considerable.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650192" id2="17" version="1065353216">But bring the documents to me and I'll see that the balance of power shifts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650194" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Refuse Quest] Doubtful.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650195" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh... of course. Sorry to have troubled you. I'll just have to find someone else.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="650197" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't talk now. I'm waiting on someone.</text>
