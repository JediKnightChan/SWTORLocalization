		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650744" id2="17" version="1065353216">The rebels have surrendered to our searches. The resistance is over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650745" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you would take on another task for us, I have a message from General Kolvin of the Imperial Reclamation Service.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650747" id2="17" version="1065353216">He believes you might be key to recovering a secret the Empire has sought for decades. Thank you for all you've done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650749" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just received word from Admiral Jefand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650751" id2="17" version="1065353216">He says thanks to you, the Flame is dead and the rebellion is in chaos.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650752" id2="17" version="1065353216">I assume I should have the rancor's share of any reward money?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650752" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do I get for it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650753" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course. It's being credited to your account right now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650754" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was just trying to avenge his people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650754" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was a good man.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650755" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we mourned every conquered planet, we would never have become an Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650756" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650757" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your reputation doesn't lie.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650759" id2="17" version="1065353216">He says that the Flame surrendered and went into voluntary exile?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650760" id2="17" version="1065353216">If he learns to yield, the Flame does not need to be our enemy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650760" id2="17" version="1065353216">I gave him a second chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650761" id2="17" version="1065353216">Admiral Jefand thinks I made a mistake.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650761" id2="17" version="1065353216">The admiral wasn't pleased.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650762" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will not defend my actions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650763" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wasn't there; I won't question you. There are certainly reasons one might have to hate the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650765" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps we all deserve a second chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650767" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't keep the admiral waiting if I were you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650768" id2="17" version="1065353216">What exactly would you prefer I didn't know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650770" id2="17" version="1065353216">Admiral Jefand! Sir, I apologize. This is--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650772" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know who they are. I would make a poor show of my rank if I failed to recognize so many heroes of the Empire in one place.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650774" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know who you are, my lord. It is an honor to have one of your stature helping us on Nar Shaddaa.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650776" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know who you are. You have made quite a reputation for yourself... in the right circles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650778" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know who you are. You've collected quite a fortune working for the Empire, have you not? All of it well-earned.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650780" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know who you are. Your reputation has not gone unnoticed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650782" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you more inclined than Agent Madel to tell me what threat has just been posed? Does this come from the Flame?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650783" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any idea why he'd have it in for you personally?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650783" id2="17" version="1065353216">He wants to kill you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650784" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does the answer come with a bonus?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650784" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's it worth to you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650785" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does a group like this truly need to haggle for every credit?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650787" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't realize Sith charged by the word.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650789" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is part of your duty, agent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650791" id2="17" version="1065353216">I believe the payments you take are for blood, not words.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650793" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you needn't answer. I know the Flame has been monitoring my communications with the Hutts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650795" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was it that obvious?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650796" id2="17" version="1065353216">Learn from this, Madel. This was hardly a secret you could have kept.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650798" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Flame must know I've been communicating with the Hutts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650800" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm here to tell them the Empire will withdraw billions of credits of business from Nar Shaddaa unless they shut down this rebellion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650801" id2="17" version="1065353216">Killing you would be quite a coup for the Flame.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650801" id2="17" version="1065353216">Which makes you a target.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650802" id2="17" version="1065353216">We must teach him the folly of targeting the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650804" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is that offer open to anyone?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650805" id2="17" version="1065353216">Aren't the Hutts neutral?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650805" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will they agree?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650806" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're welcome to claim neutrality... as long as they don't interfere with our plans.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650808" id2="17" version="1065353216">I invite you to come with me when I meet with the Hutts. Your activities have made an impression on the Cartel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650809" id2="17" version="1065353216">And it won't hurt your bargaining position to remind them of the power of the Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650809" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can do that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650810" id2="17" version="1065353216">It never does.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650812" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do the talking, I'll keep an eye on what's happening behind the scenes?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650812" id2="17" version="1065353216">Standard arrangement, then?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650813" id2="17" version="1065353216">I see you've done this before.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650815" id2="17" version="1065353216">Negotiation isn't exactly my specialty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650815" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll give it a shot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650816" id2="17" version="1065353216">I believe your presence will be sufficient... incentive, for the Hutts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650818" id2="17" version="1065353216">What exactly do you expect from me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650818" id2="17" version="1065353216">Give me details.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650819" id2="17" version="1065353216">Accompany me to the meeting, help the Hutts see the wisdom of cooperating.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650821" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm nobody's hanger-on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650822" id2="17" version="1065353216">I meant this as an arrangement between equals. The Hutts respect you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650824" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're interested, I suggest you go first, to flush out and destroy any of these rebels who might lie in wait.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650826" id2="17" version="1065353216">I leave for my meeting shortly. I hope to see you there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650828" id2="17" version="1065353216">Knowing Admiral Jefand, I'd suggest you go now. He'll expect the route to his meeting to be cleared before he leaves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650831" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your trap's been sprung. Here are the notes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650832" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me see--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650834" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blasted rebels! The Flame is planning an attack on Admiral Jefand Ange. He can't know about this. I was supposed to--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650836" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be careful. They will be watching you as you get closer to the square.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650839" id2="17" version="1065353216">Greetings. I heard of your success with the Shadow Syndicate. I was hoping you might put those talents to work for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650841" id2="17" version="1065353216">Greetings, my lord. I heard of your arrival on Nar Shaddaa and was hoping you might make your way to this sector.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Greetings from HQ, my friend. They were hoping you could help me out with a little difficulty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650845" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah. I had heard you'd come to Nar Shaddaa. Can I hope you're looking for work?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650847" id2="17" version="1065353216">My name is Madel Felth, Imperial Intelligence, and I am here to stop a revolution.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650848" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been known to stop... or start... a few wars in my day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650848" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need help?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650849" id2="17" version="1065353216">Give me the specs, I'll give you the price.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650849" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's the job?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650850" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've always thought Hutts were revolting....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650850" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is that a joke?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650851" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Hutts are not known for their senses of humor. But they are not our enemy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650853" id2="17" version="1065353216">This sector is home to alien refugees who escaped our slavers. They've never been a threat, but a new leader recently emerged.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650855" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think I'd be interested?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650856" id2="17" version="1065353216">They call this place the &quot;Duros Sector,&quot; but it's not just Duros who live here. Alien refugees from across the galaxy have fled here. Fled from us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650858" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now a leader has emerged to unite the different species.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650860" id2="17" version="1065353216">They call him &quot;the Flame,&quot; and we have killed him twice. Each time, he reappears. The locals claim he's immortal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650861" id2="17" version="1065353216">Third time's the charm?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650861" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want me to try again?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650862" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the guy's got nine lives, you're paying for each one separate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650862" id2="17" version="1065353216">That'll be extra.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650863" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is that possible?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650863" id2="17" version="1065353216">Immortal?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650864" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only the Emperor himself can claim true immortality. But I'm not asking you to kill the Flame--yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650866" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our only undercover agent in his gang was recently discovered and murdered.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650868" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think I'll pass.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please. We had an agent undercover in the Flame's gang. They found him out and killed him, brutally.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650871" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Flame insisted the corpse be publicly displayed in Rana Mas Square to taunt us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650872" id2="17" version="1065353216">If they're baiting you, they want something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650872" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like a trap.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650873" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, there's no doubt it's a trap. But they have bait we're hard-pressed to resist.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650875" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you care about the body?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650875" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is there more to this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650876" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're right, of course. The body alone would not be sufficient bait for this trap.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650878" id2="17" version="1065353216">If he's out in the open like that, it shouldn't be too difficult.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650878" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want me to get it back?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650879" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, it's a trap. And they've found a bait we can't resist.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650881" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't expect me to cry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650882" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our man knew the risks, but they're using more than just his death to bait their trap.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650884" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everything our agent found, all his notes, are pinned to the corpse in plain view.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650886" id2="17" version="1065353216">But every team I've sent to retrieve the records has come back in pieces. You may be the only one who could walk into this trap and survive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650887" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let these aliens do their worst, they have not faced a Sith before.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650887" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will retrieve the records.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650888" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was my thought precisely, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650890" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll give them pointers on the best pieces to send.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650890" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would love to meet them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650891" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps I was unclear, my lord. I don't doubt their skill at butchery.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650893" id2="17" version="1065353216">This corpse has been there for days, right? What's so urgent now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650893" id2="17" version="1065353216">You sound nervous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650894" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should know better than to try to get anything by you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650896" id2="17" version="1065353216">Admiral Jefand Ange arrives today to discuss this problem with the Hutts. My job is on the line.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650898" id2="17" version="1065353216">My jobs don't often require me to work so publicly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650898" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like a good challenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650899" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll be making a statement. There is no trap they can set that we cannot break.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650901" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's it worth to you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650902" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course. We have a healthy budget; the Minister of Intelligence is quite concerned about this rebellion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650904" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need those records back. Admiral Jefand Ange is due to arrive today to speak with the Hutts about this problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650906" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once you have the records, use this on the body to burn it. We can't have them use one of our own as a rallying point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650908" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't make a habit of walking into traps.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="650908" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a fool. [Refuse quest.]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650909" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then we may never learn how far this Flame's conspiracy has spread.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="650911" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you'd like to contribute to the cause of refugee resettlement, please speak with the desk.</text>
