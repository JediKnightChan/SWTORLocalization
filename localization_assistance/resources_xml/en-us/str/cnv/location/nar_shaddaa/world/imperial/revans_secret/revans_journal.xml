		<text bitflag="321" id1="650481" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fools on both sides. All who thought the Star Forge a mere weapon, they didn't know. They never wanted to know.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="650483" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is the seed of worlds. Such power, even in a fragment....</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="650485" id2="17" version="1065353216">A fleet, that's what I made of it. Almost laughable now. What of its smallest piece? It cannot build ships, no; what useless fragments does it generate?</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="650487" id2="17" version="1065353216">Air. Life.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="650489" id2="17" version="1065353216">It feeds on the Force, on energy, on mass, on whatever you give it. And it creates. That is its nature.</text>

		<text bitflag="321" id1="650493" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why bother with fleets, when one day we might build our own galaxies?</text>
