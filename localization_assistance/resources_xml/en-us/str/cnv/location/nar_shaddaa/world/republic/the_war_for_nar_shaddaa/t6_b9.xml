		<text bitflag="3393" id1="646968" id2="17" version="1065353216">Teesix = erased memory core + restarting systems // You = friend?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="646971" id2="17" version="1065353216">Organic beings = returned + successful // Master = standing by + excited</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="646972" id2="17" version="1065353216">Organic life-form = returned + successful // Master = eager to communicate</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646974" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank goodness you're alive. According to the droid, your mission was a complete success. POWs are escaping to Republic transports.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646976" id2="17" version="1065353216">Plus there was a major attack on an Imperial-owned superstructure. Massive damage. Hundreds of fatalities--maybe thousands. Know anything about it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646977" id2="17" version="1065353216">An agent took those explosives you sent. Carried out the bombing. It was time to send the Empire a message.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="646977" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was all part of the plan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646978" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those explosives were meant to help with the prison break. That wasn't a message, it was mass-murder!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646980" id2="17" version="1065353216">What is this place doing to us? I just killed a man and framed someone else for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646982" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this really how we're going to win the war?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646984" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're waiting to give you a hero's welcome back at the spaceport. Don't worry, I won't tell them the truth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646985" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire has plenty of enemies. It sounds like one of them got proactive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="646985" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Lie] Just a random bombing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646986" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the strange thing. No one's claimed responsibility. Who would want to? So much killing today....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646988" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've won the war for Nar Shaddaa. Forced the Empire to fall back. They're not used to retreating.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646989" id2="17" version="1065353216">They'll be doing a lot of that, from now on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="646989" id2="17" version="1065353216">They'd better get used to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646990" id2="17" version="1065353216">Won't that be something to see? It'd almost make the cost of winning bearable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646992" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's your status? Are you alright?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="646992" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where are you? What happened?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646993" id2="17" version="1065353216">Eventually, they'll have no place to fall back to--and then we finish them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="646993" id2="17" version="1065353216">Next time, they die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646994" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd accept unconditional surrender. There's been enough killing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646996" id2="17" version="1065353216">I took care of my superior. The agent I framed for it tried to run, and they killed her. No loose ends. I'm clear.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="646998" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm about to board a shuttle for Coruscant. Think I got out of Imperial Intelligence just in time. Thanks for convincing me to leave.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647000" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should report back to the spaceport. Let them know we won. It's been an honor. Logging off....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="647002" id2="17" version="1065353216">New command received = erase all datalogs // You = free to go + farewell!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="647008" id2="17" version="1065353216">Teesix = awaiting new commands // You = help Republic allies</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="647011" id2="17" version="1065353216">Organic beings = match master's profile data + arrive within schedule parameters // Signaling Republic operative = now</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="647012" id2="17" version="1065353216">Organic life-form = matches master's profile data + arrives on schedule // Signaling Republic operative = now</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647014" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lookie, lookie... fresh meat for the Shadow Town grinders. You too tough to chew? We'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647016" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry, threw away my manners when I went undercover. Weeks--months ago? Agent Valland. That's me. The people here are crazy, you know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647017" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire is preparing to execute Republic POWs. We need to free our people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647017" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our people are here, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647018" id2="17" version="1065353216">Noble cause. Good way to die, as dying ways go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647020" id2="17" version="1065353216">You seem a little... not normal. Could I see some identification?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647020" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you also crazy?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647021" id2="17" version="1065353216">Normal is as normal does. Down here, normal does a lot of strange things. Have to blend in. SIS training. I don't carry ID.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647023" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no time for your nonsense. We have a mission to complete.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647023" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stop your babbling.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647024" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right, mission. Always need one. I've got mine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647026" id2="17" version="1065353216">You brought the supply pack, right? Let's have a look. Ooh... detonite--and lots of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647028" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you know the Empire burned out SIS headquarters? Killed good agents. Friends... and more. One good burn deserves another.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647029" id2="17" version="1065353216">I saw what happened to your friends--but you're talking about revenge, not rescue. Unless that detonite can save lives, it's useless.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647029" id2="17" version="1065353216">We aren't here to bomb things.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647030" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's easy. Killing Imperials will save lives.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647032" id2="17" version="1065353216">I sense great pain and fear in you. Those feelings only lead to destruction.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647032" id2="17" version="1065353216">Control your emotions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647033" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just where I want to go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647035" id2="17" version="1065353216">As long as we're burning through prison gates, I'm in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647035" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our mission is to free POWs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647036" id2="17" version="1065353216">I had something a little larger in mind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647038" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not sure you're in any condition to handle bombs. Maybe you should hand those back....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647038" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me keep the explosives.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647039" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're funny. You'll blend right in down here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647041" id2="17" version="1065353216">How are you planning to burn the Empire? This is a prison, not a military base.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647041" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's your target?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647042" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did the Empire find our spy base, much less destroy it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647042" id2="17" version="1065353216">SIS headquarters is destroyed?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647043" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't know. All the people I could ask are dead. Doesn't matter. Blood calls out for blood.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647045" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire needs to learn this is our galaxy. If they take out one of our bases, we burn down ten of theirs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647045" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's always been my policy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647046" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ambitious. I like it. On the other hand, there's a lot to be said for blowing up one big thing....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647048" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire bought a superstructure from the Hutts. Nice place. Put all kinds of important people inside. Leaders. But this building has weak spots.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647050" id2="17" version="1065353216">Figure this is enough detonite to gut the insides before they catch me. Go out with a bang.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647051" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's our enemy's tactic, not to mention suicide. Pull yourself together--our people are in terrible danger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647051" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll do no such thing!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647053" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take those charges and create a diversion. Keep Imperial security forces busy so we can free the POWs and cover their escape.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647054" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can tell you haven't been here long. Still an idealist.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647056" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine, we play it your way. Set the Empire's tail on fire and let it chase itself. Could be fun.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647058" id2="17" version="1065353216">There are other agents nearby. Optimists, like you. I'll signal you're here to help. Don't be a stranger....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647059" id2="17" version="1065353216">Make your sacrifice count. Unless the enemy loses a thousand people, you're wasting effort.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="647059" id2="17" version="1065353216">Destroy them all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647060" id2="17" version="1065353216">Big building. It'll be full when I make my run.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647062" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still a few friendlies left, trying to crack the prison open. Optimistic types. They need your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="647064" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't tell anyone my mission. &quot;Need to know,&quot; right? Be seeing you. Not really....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="647066" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master's command = fulfilled // Teesix = powering down + awaiting new command</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="647068" id2="17" version="1065353216">You = go now + help Republic allies + return later</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="647072" id2="17" version="1065353216">Prison annex = restricted to Imperial personnel // You = trespasser</text>
