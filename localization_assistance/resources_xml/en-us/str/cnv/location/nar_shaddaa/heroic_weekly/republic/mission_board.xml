CITIZEN TRAVEL ADVISORY

To all Republic citizens in the Red Light Sector: Be advised the Gauntlet criminal gang has set up a death duel tournament in the back alleys. Poor refugees are running the gang's ordeal for credit rewards. The Gauntlet is broadcasting holos of these fights. No refugee has survived to collect a prize.

The Hutt Cartel refuses to intervene in this despicable &quot;entertainment.&quot; All tourists should avoid the area, but trained Republic agents are encouraged to end the Gauntlet's activities by destroying its holorecording equipment and driving off the gangsters.

If you're warrior enough to face the greatest Mandalorian clan on Nar Shaddaa, come to our coordinates. We promise a warm welcome, but only if you come quickly.

We have just sipped upon the finest combat stims on Nar Shaddaa, and we're feeling especially good right now. We want a worthy challenge. If you won't come to us, we'll just have to start torching Republic buildings until we find something better to amuse us.

-- Kassor Quade, Clan Sharratt Chieftain

CLEARANCE APPROVED

The Strategic Information Service has an ultraviolet-level mission requiring immediate action. The Empire's chief engineers have arrived to upgrade Shadow Town's cranial explosives technology. This is a rare opportunity to exploit the enemy's vulnerability.

If Republic scientists can examine the cranial device's technical schematics, they could learn how to safely deactivate the explosives detonator. This would allow SIS agents to extract prisoners from Shadow Town. Proceed to the Shadow Town prison control center, neutralize resistance and recover the schematics.
