		<text bitflag="3393" id1="654874" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our purposes crossed over nicely, Sith. Rathari's reign has ended, and the Cartel has full control of its affairs again.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="654875" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have defeated Lord Rathari, and his reign on Nar Shaddaa has ended.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="654877" id2="17" version="1065353216">You wagered on yourself. Ybann the Hutt suspects you knew the deck was stacked in your favor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="654878" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let that be a lesson to you, Ybann. Always bet on me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="654878" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never doubt me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="654879" id2="17" version="1065353216">After this display, I doubt I will find any takers foolish enough to bet against you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="654881" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't try to slime your way out of paying.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="654881" id2="17" version="1065353216">Honor your debt.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="654882" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do not insult me. I always make good on my bets.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="654884" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a sucker bet, Ybann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="654884" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were foolish.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="654885" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh. It won't be the last time Ybann makes a bad bet.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="654887" id2="17" version="1065353216">Both you and the Cartel have benefited from today. We appreciate your efforts and skill. Please leave us to our business.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="654889" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh. Lord Rathari still lives and breathes. Perhaps you have doubts about facing him.</text>
