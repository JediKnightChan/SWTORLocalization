		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201505" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where... what's happened? I can feel... no. No!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201507" id2="17" version="1065353216">What have you done? There's nothing to restrain him now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201508" id2="17" version="1065353216">We were sent to free you. They told us you can defeat the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201508" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is our mission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201509" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been the Emperor's best-kept secret for centuries. How did you find me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201510" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leaving you here wouldn't be much of a rescue. The Republic needs your help to defeat the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201510" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is my mission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201511" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force is strong in you. Stronger than I've felt in a long time. And there is another....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201512" id2="17" version="1065353216">That insignia... you serve the Republic. Not a Jedi, but I sense one here....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201513" id2="17" version="1065353216">You shouldn't be here. You can't even use the Force, but I sense something....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201514" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were the one being restrained.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201514" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you mean?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201515" id2="17" version="1065353216">My struggle held the Emperor in check. How did you find me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201516" id2="17" version="1065353216">I fought half the Empire to free you. Is this how you say thanks?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201516" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're welcome, jerk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201517" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who are you? Who sent you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201519" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your strength fails. You must be free, or all is lost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201521" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should be one with the Force. Finally at peace.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201523" id2="17" version="1065353216">No peace while you suffer. The Emperor drowns you in black waters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201525" id2="17" version="1065353216">He wants me to be Darth Revan again. Serve him as I did centuries ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201526" id2="17" version="1065353216">You served the Emperor? Doesn't that make you a Sith?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201526" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you were a Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201527" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I fell to the dark side, I became his pawn--sent to wound the Republic. The Jedi destroyed and rebuilt me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201529" id2="17" version="1065353216">The holorecords say you brought the Republic to its knees as a Sith and saved it as a Jedi. They also say you're dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201529" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're &quot;the&quot; Revan. Amazing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201530" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am dead... and reborn, over and over. Jedi... Sith... many lifetimes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201532" id2="17" version="1065353216">You look good for your age, Revan. What's your secret?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201532" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wow, you're old.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201533" id2="17" version="1065353216">I led my allies to the galaxy's edge to destroy the Emperor. We didn't understand his true power.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201535" id2="17" version="1065353216">I lost everyone... betrayed from within. The Emperor imprisoned me, kept me alive with Sith alchemy... used me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201536" id2="17" version="1065353216">You aren't the only one who's lived much longer than normal. How old is the Emperor? How does he survive?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201536" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor has a long life.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201537" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's seen the passage of millennia. His will to live outstrips age, disease... death itself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201539" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your friend denies the Force's will to stay with you, help you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201539" id2="17" version="1065353216">You still have her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201540" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was she who gave me strength to resist all this time. I didn't realize that until now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201542" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds to me like the Emperor's earned everything that's coming to him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201542" id2="17" version="1065353216">Time for some payback.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201543" id2="17" version="1065353216">His evil won't be contained. It has to be annihilated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201545" id2="17" version="1065353216">You Jedi lead exciting lives--and by &quot;exciting,&quot; I mean &quot;crazy stuff I'm glad doesn't happen to me.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201545" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is one insane story.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201546" id2="17" version="1065353216">Like it or not, you're part of this. We all are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201548" id2="17" version="1065353216">What use were you to him locked up in here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201548" id2="17" version="1065353216">Used you how?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201549" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've known both sides of the Force--light and dark. To him, I was a conduit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201551" id2="17" version="1065353216">One of your allies stabbed you in the back? I assume they paid for that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="201551" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who betrayed you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201552" id2="17" version="1065353216">He still lives by the same dark forces I do, serving as the Emperor's executioner--his undying wrath.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201554" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor used me as his link to the light side of the Force--the Jedi Order. Through me, he saw visions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201556" id2="17" version="1065353216">But that same link also gave me influence. I convinced the Emperor peace was in his best interest. Tempered his hate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201558" id2="17" version="1065353216">The peace is lost. The Emperor makes his final war. Stop him. Flee this place while you can. Use the enemy's vessels.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201560" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, old friend. I will finish what we started.</text>
