		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201667" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got droids attacking the ship! We can't maintain a comm channel!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201668" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can you hear us? They're using the Foundry's weapon systems to hold back our fleet--you need to take control!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201669" id2="17" version="1065353216">Three more Republic cruisers have been destroyed, but they're not retreating.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201670" id2="17" version="1065353216">Objection: My master promised you would die horribly at my hands. At this rate, you'll perish well before then.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201671" id2="17" version="1065353216">Observation: This assault is hardly an adequate test of Foundry defenses. Please provide more organic meatbags to slaughter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201672" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperative: Extermination units converge on intruders. Psycholocutor and observer specialties report to tactical control.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201673" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperial destroyer Firelance has gone critical. The Republic fleet is holding steady.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201674" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're monitoring the fleet battle... the Republic's surrounded the Foundry. We won't be getting reinforcements.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201675" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll stay behind to defend the step and guard your escape route. Good luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="201676" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperial ships have jumped out of hyperspace. Lock down all sections! Repeat, lock down!</text>
