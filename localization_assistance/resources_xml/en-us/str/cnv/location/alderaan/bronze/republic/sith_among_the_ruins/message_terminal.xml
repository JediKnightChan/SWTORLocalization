		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317734" id2="17" version="1065353216">Urgent! House Organa seeks aid! With House Thul's assistance, the Empire has established a base on Alderaanian soil. Imperial forces now occupy an ancient ruin in the mountains. Our spies report these forces are led by Sith commanders. 

House Organa cannot fight a war on two fronts. We urgently request willing and capable volunteers to infiltrate this base, defeat the Sith and stop this Imperial menace. Hazard pay is offered to those who survive the battle.

For House Organa!</text>
