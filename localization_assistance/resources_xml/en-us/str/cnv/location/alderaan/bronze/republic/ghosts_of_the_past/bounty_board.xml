		<text bitflag="1345" id1="553298" id2="17" version="1065353216">Urgent! House Organa seeks aid! Despite our diplomatic efforts, House Thul has brought chaos and bloodshed to Alderaan. We have received reports of Imperial probe droids in the area, further evidence that House Thul has allied themselves with the Empire.

If these reports are true, the Empire's intel must not be allowed to reach House Thul. Organa forces brought down a probe droid in the area, but were overwhelmed by Thul forces during recovery. Hazard pay is offered to any volunteers able to overcome these invaders and reach the wreckage. Proceed with caution: Thul forces appear to have advanced reconnaissance and combat training.

If successful, deliver any intel recovered to Rickard Organa. For House Organa!</text>
