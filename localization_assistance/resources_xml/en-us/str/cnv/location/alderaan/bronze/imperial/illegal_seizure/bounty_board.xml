		<text bitflag="321" id1="727918" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperial Edict 273: Alderaan belongs to House Thul. That fact is beyond question. Yet House Ulgo dares to defy us. Ulgo troops have reclaimed the shield generator that once protected Castle Panteer. If reactivated, House Ulgo will gain an unacceptable advantage.

The Panteer generator must be destroyed. Any available forces are ordered to invade the Ulgos' nearest supply camp, obtain their access codes, and activate the generator's self destruct. Coordinates have been provided.

Show House Ulgo the cost of challenging the Empire and her allies. Death to the usurpers!</text>
