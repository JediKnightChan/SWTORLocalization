		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318709" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;And so it is with great regret that I inform you that your son has... died like an incompetent--&quot; no....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318711" id2="17" version="1065353216">I found the Organa transport. It was packed with war droids, but they won't be a problem anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318712" id2="17" version="1065353216">War droids? Well, that explains a few things.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318714" id2="17" version="1065353216">Outstanding work on your part. Handled those droids before we even realized they were a threat. If only the Thuls had been so useful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318716" id2="17" version="1065353216">Speaking of which, I suppose it's up to me to convey the Empire's condolences over their passing. That won't be awkward.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318718" id2="17" version="1065353216">The snow should have melted enough for you to check out that transport. Let me know what you find.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318721" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord, I need your help. I've had it with these Thuls!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318723" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sir, you must do something. These Thuls are useless!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318725" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those blasted Thuls have failed us for the last time!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318727" id2="17" version="1065353216">Always pestering me, begging me to send them off on some vital mission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318729" id2="17" version="1065353216">I finally caved, allowed some of them to investigate a crashed Organa transport. Two days, and still no word from them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318730" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're noblemen. What did you expect?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318730" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course they failed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318731" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know... a shred of competence?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318733" id2="17" version="1065353216">You suspect something?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318734" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a transport--a broken one, at that. Should've been a breeze.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318736" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who cares?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318737" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't give a toss about the Thuls either, but that ship may be important.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318739" id2="17" version="1065353216">My men downed the vessel a few days ago. It crashed somewhere nearby, buried under a mountain of snow.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318741" id2="17" version="1065353216">I asked for someone to investigate the wreckage when the snow thawed, and those twits volunteered. Like an idiot, I allowed it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318742" id2="17" version="1065353216">They were weak. The transport is our only concern.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318742" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget the Thuls.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318743" id2="17" version="1065353216">Couldn't agree more.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318745" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's high time the Thuls started carrying their own weight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318745" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was the right call.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318746" id2="17" version="1065353216">Makes you wonder how they ever got by without us here to hold their hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318748" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's why you don't send a bunch of blue bloods to do a soldier's job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318748" id2="17" version="1065353216">Should've used a professional.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318749" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lesson learned.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318751" id2="17" version="1065353216">You could have said &quot;no.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318751" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why didn't you refuse?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318752" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought I was throwing them a bone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318754" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any idea what the transport was carrying?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318754" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's in the wreckage?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318755" id2="17" version="1065353216">Could be anything: weapons, supplies, someone's wardrobe....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318757" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're probably just lost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318758" id2="17" version="1065353216">If they were still alive, we'd have heard something, a distress call, anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318760" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's possible the Organas were bringing in something dangerous. With the Thuls not responding, that seems to imply that it was important.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318761" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll pick up the Thuls' slack.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318762" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure you'll have more success than those dandies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318764" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll check it out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318765" id2="17" version="1065353216">The crash site isn't far. Check the wreckage, find out what the Organas were transporting, and maybe we'll solve this mystery.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318767" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do it yourself. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318768" id2="17" version="1065353216">Very well. I'm sure there are plenty more noblemen dying to prove themselves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318770" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do we really need the Thuls?</text>
