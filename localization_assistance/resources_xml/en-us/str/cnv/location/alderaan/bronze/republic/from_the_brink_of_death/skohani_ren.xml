		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318085" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's still recovering. Once he wakes up, I'll tell him everything you did.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318087" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got the water. Let's hope it really can flush that poison.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318088" id2="17" version="1065353216">The hive mind was distracted. The Killiks lost their hold on him, with my help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318092" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's going to pull through. I don't know how, but the water neutralized the toxins in his bloodstream.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318094" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sometimes the Force alone won't heal us. I'm glad you were here. So is he.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318096" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please hurry. His time's running out.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318097" id2="17" version="1065353216">Breathe. Relax. I sense the hive mind. Countless voices, imprinting, taking hold... blast! I can't control it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318099" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Jedi. I could use your skills.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318101" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please. I need your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318103" id2="17" version="1065353216">This man is in the process of being joined to the Killiks. I've tried everything, but he's beyond my power.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318104" id2="17" version="1065353216">There must be some way to save this man.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318104" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can't give up on him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318105" id2="17" version="1065353216">Force healing hasn't worked. One voice can't rise above a thousand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318107" id2="17" version="1065353216">There must be a counteragent. What was the assassin's preferred toxin?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318107" id2="17" version="1065353216">Every poison has an antidote.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318108" id2="17" version="1065353216">Prolonged exposure to Killik pheromones. This poor soldier was fighting them too long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318110" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the killer got this close, he could injure someone else.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318110" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where's the assassin?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318111" id2="17" version="1065353216">If he had fallen in battle or been taken prisoner...but this is unjust.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318113" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've seen Chiss with better color.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318113" id2="17" version="1065353216">He sure looks like it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318114" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please. He may be unconscious, but he can still hear us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318116" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was he the assassin's target, or just unlucky?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318116" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who is he?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318117" id2="17" version="1065353216">Each Killik is part of the greater collective, the hive mind. They think and speak and reason as one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318121" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then why bother me?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318122" id2="17" version="1065353216">If this man is joined to the Killiks, he'll share their thoughts, their feelings...all at the cost of his own.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318124" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the hive was distracted, maybe I could repel them. A surprise attack or raid...but I can't leave him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318126" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a big 'if.'</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318127" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't have any other choice. The joining process moves quick.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318129" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll focus, wait for the right moment before trying again. Hurry!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318131" id2="17" version="1065353216">It won't help. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318132" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's it, then. Within days, he'll be a full Joiner. Another drone.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318134" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please give the man some air. The Killiks have done enough damage.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="727848" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're back! Look, his eyes...they're clearing up. Whatever you did, it worked.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="727850" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did your best.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="727851" id2="17" version="1065353216">This wasn't an accident.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="727852" id2="17" version="1065353216">Joined to the Killiks?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="727853" id2="17" version="1065353216">Say no more.</text>
