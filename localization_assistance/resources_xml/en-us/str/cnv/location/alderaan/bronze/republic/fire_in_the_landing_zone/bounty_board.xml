These supplies are illegal and highly volatile. Their use on the battlefield could result in major casualties for Organa and Republic forces.

House Organa has prepared an aerial strike team to bombard the landing pad and end the Empire's illegal trade, but they require precise coordinates to make a successful attack. Hazard pay is offered to any volunteers able to breach the landing pad's defenses and plant the provided beacons. 

If successful, signal Organa forces through the nearest comm station. House Thul shall not prevail!</text>
