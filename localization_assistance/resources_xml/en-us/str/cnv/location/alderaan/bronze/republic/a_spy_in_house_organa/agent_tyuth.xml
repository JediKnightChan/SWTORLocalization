		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318331" id2="17" version="1065353216">Without Elric Organa feeding them information, House Thul's on a losing streak. All thanks to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318333" id2="17" version="1065353216">Elric Organa is dead. He tried to fight his way out.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318334" id2="17" version="1065353216">With a little help from Thul soldiers, I hear. As if we needed any more evidence he was a traitor.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318336" id2="17" version="1065353216">Would have been nice to question him, but this was no less than he deserves. Thanks for the help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318338" id2="17" version="1065353216">Find Elric Organa--if the scum hasn't run to House Thul by now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318341" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wait. Wasn't expecting a whole squad, but Elric might have backup.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318343" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hoped you'd pass my way, Master Jedi. I need someone persuasive.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318345" id2="17" version="1065353216">Need some help, Lieutenant. Not much time, so I'll brief you quick.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318347" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't know you or your business. Just what I need, if you're willing.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318349" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agent Tyuth, SIS. Republic forces can't seem to hold this area, and now we know why. A traitor named Elric Organa.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Every order we send to House Organa, Elric sends on to House Thul. We've lost several fortifications and a lot of men.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318352" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why would Elric betray his own house?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318352" id2="17" version="1065353216">But Organa's his blood!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318353" id2="17" version="1065353216">Credits? Thul threats? Doesn't matter to me. Treason is treason.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318355" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need backup?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318356" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's like using a sandbag to stop a flood. Gotta plug the leak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318358" id2="17" version="1065353216">So go arrest him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318359" id2="17" version="1065353216">Elric seems to disappear whenever I enter his camp. The other nobles say he's acting strange, paranoid, jumpy.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318361" id2="17" version="1065353216">I come near him again, he might get scared. He'll head straight for House Thul, and we'll never get him back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318362" id2="17" version="1065353216">Elric wouldn't get the chance with me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318362" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd like to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318363" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once he sees you, I don't think he'll want to try.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318365" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not the most subtle agent I've met.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318365" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can't blame him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318366" id2="17" version="1065353216">Some of us find the traitors. Others handle the interrogations.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318368" id2="17" version="1065353216">This isn't my job.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318369" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've beaten the best from here to Coruscant, but Elric doesn't know you. He won't suspect a thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318371" id2="17" version="1065353216">All you have to do is find him and confront him. If he's smart, he'll turn himself in then and there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="318372" id2="17" version="1065353216">Elric's gone this far. Why surrender now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318372" id2="17" version="1065353216">And if he's not?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318373" id2="17" version="1065353216">His funeral. You've got my authorization to take him down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318375" id2="17" version="1065353216">One way to find out.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318376" id2="17" version="1065353216">Move fast. Man's so jittery he might bolt before you get there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="318378" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can't help you. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318379" id2="17" version="1065353216">Alderaan's at war. If you're not gonna help, why are you here?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="318381" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep your eyes open. Not everyone around here's loyal to House Organa--or the Republic.</text>
