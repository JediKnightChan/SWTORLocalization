Their most lethal weapon is a poison: the &quot;Tears of the Rist.&quot; Invisible, absorbed through the skin and utterly fatal. Many Thul soldiers have fallen to this diabolical concoction.

The &quot;Tears of the Rist&quot; must be analyzed if it is be beaten. Hardy, well-armed mercenaries are asked to recover samples of this poison from known Rist caches. Proceed with extreme caution: Rist operatives have been spotted in the area.

If successful, deliver the samples to the nearest outpost. If exposed to the poison, House Thul will cherish your memory.</text>
