		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317602" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let my partner at the Republic outpost know how the op's going. He'll be taking over from here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317603" id2="17" version="1065353216">Use plenty of Thul gas grenades against those Baliss soldiers. Did I say that too loud?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317617" id2="17" version="1065353216">With a few canisters of that gas, House Thul could conquer the Republic-friendly houses in a few weeks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317617" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leaving no one to resist them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317620" id2="17" version="1065353216">People who are affected by this gas. Do they recover?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317620" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is the gas fatal?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317623" id2="17" version="1065353216">I could have used a gas like that to get out of a few scrapes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317623" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds very handy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317632" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm obviously not associated with either House Thul or House Baliss. They'll realize this is a setup.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317632" id2="17" version="1065353216">They won't be fooled.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317642" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shush! Don't draw attention to me, okay?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727738" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. Big team, increases the risk of security leaks. Still, can't be too picky.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727740" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Jedi. Good. Good. Someone I can trust to keep quiet. I can, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727742" id2="17" version="1065353216">You. Soldier. What's your clearance? You authorized for classified ops?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727744" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who're you? Spacer, right? Huh. I guess money can buy a lot of no questions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727746" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agent Shyrack, SIS--no, act normal. I'm after House Thul, those Imperial toadies. They have a new weapon I'd like to see gone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727748" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thul ordered their vassal, House Baliss, to develop a special nerve gas. Can knock out a whole palace of people in minutes, silently.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727749" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep your voice down! Yes, exactly. We need to turn their advantage into ours.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727751" id2="17" version="1065353216">Reports are sketchy. Unconsciousness, nausea, lethargy, no reported deaths in testing. Yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727753" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not a toy! It's--see this gas in action, you'll understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="727755" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need that gas destroyed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="727756" id2="17" version="1065353216">War brings new weapons. So?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727757" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thul's field-testing the nerve gas today. And House Baliss is doing military exercises. This is a chance to turn them against each other.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727759" id2="17" version="1065353216">If someone--say, you--got hold of Thul's gas grenades, and used them against Baliss soldiers, both houses will start hurling accusations. Allowing us to hit their gas stockpiles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="727760" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a good cause. I'm in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727761" id2="17" version="1065353216">True, they'll catch on. Eventually. But all we need is a few days of infighting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727763" id2="17" version="1065353216">Find the Thul soldiers using the gas grenades. Take the grenades and stage an attack on Baliss' forces--look, they're stationed here, and here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727765" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you're done, report in to my partner at the Republic outpost. Discreetly. We need to move against those gas stockpiles fast.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="727767" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, thanks. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="727768" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then don't tell anyone we spoke, all right? And forget I said that, too.</text>
