		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317886" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks to you, the cover for our contact inside House Ulgo is secure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317888" id2="17" version="1065353216">I found the spikes. Your man in Ulgo is safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317889" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nice work. I had a hunch you wouldn't let me down.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317893" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's good to know the Republic has someone like you on our side.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317897" id2="17" version="1065353216">Retrieve the spikes from the Killik warrens and bring them back to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317900" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agent Essor. Republic SIS.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317902" id2="17" version="1065353216">Always a pleasure to meet a guardian of the Republic. Especially since I've got a problem that could use a Jedi's touch.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317904" id2="17" version="1065353216">Always a pleasure to meet a member of the Republic's fine fighting troops. Especially since I've got a problem that could use a soldier's touch.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317906" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've seen the SIS files on you. You've done a fair bit of work for the Republic. That's good, because I could really use some help right now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317908" id2="17" version="1065353216">The SIS spent months getting one of our agents deep inside House Ulgo. If we don't act fast, the whole operation could end in disaster.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317909" id2="17" version="1065353216">What went wrong?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317910" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's the name of your contact inside House Ulgo?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317910" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who's the agent?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317911" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kamen Proy. One of our top agents. We'd hate to lose him over something like this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317913" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not prepared for this?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317914" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have contingency plans for all the typical scenarios. But we didn't expect anything like this.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317916" id2="17" version="1065353216">A messenger was transporting prototype computer spikes to our contact--SIS technology designed to decrypt and upload enemy data, highly secret and highly advanced.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317918" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Killiks caught our messenger and dragged him off into their warrens, along with the spikes. If they fall into the wrong hands, our agent's in danger--if not the whole SIS.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317919" id2="17" version="1065353216">All you seem to care about is what happened to those spikes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317919" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about the messenger?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317920" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm just being realistic. The messenger's dead; there's nothing we can do for him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317922" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nobody's going to find it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317923" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nobody's going to find it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="317924" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said it yourself--the spikes are buried somewhere deep inside the Killik warrens. They're not going to turn up anytime soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317924" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nobody's going to find it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317925" id2="17" version="1065353216">The SIS doesn't like to leave loose ends. They have a way of making things unravel.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317927" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyone who finds those spikes will know the SIS is operating here--worse, they'll have a technology that's supposed to be top secret.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317929" id2="17" version="1065353216">This tragic situation could become a galactic incident. If you can locate those spikes in the Killik nest, I'll be here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="317931" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pass. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317932" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then get on your way and I'll try to find someone who can help me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="317936" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't want to talk right now.</text>
