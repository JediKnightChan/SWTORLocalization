		<text bitflag="321" id1="318198" id2="17" version="1065353216">Urgent! House Organa seeks aid! It is now clear that the despots of House Ulgo will not accept a peaceful resolution. House Ulgo has acquired a massive weapons stockpile from their underworld contacts. A renewed assault on our holdings appears inevitable.

House Organa seeks loyal and talented agents willing to destroy the Ulgo weapons stockpile and bring Alderaan closer to peace. A reward is offered to any agent who is successful. 

For House Organa!</text>
