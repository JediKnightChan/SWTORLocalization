		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536420" id2="17" version="1065353216">I knew it would be you. Did Jari beg you to &quot;save me&quot;?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536422" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi are rats. Stomp on one, and another comes scuttling back in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536423" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jari was a loyal comrade who fought by your side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536423" id2="17" version="1065353216">That &quot;rat&quot; was your ally.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536424" id2="17" version="1065353216">And tortured me with his constant, goody-two-shoes sniveling.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536426" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me where the First Son is, or what he's planning, and I'll ask the Republic for clemency.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536426" id2="17" version="1065353216">Help me, and I'll help you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536427" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think I need to ask for mercy?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536429" id2="17" version="1065353216">My forces have taken your walkers apart.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536429" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I brought friends.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536430" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just a setback. I'll still be standing when the First Son returns.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536432" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know what you did to Blaesus, and Geland, and Sophia Farash. I'm not losing Guardian Hold Six to a monster like you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536433" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Council understands what was done to you--there may be some way to stop it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536433" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Jedi can help you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536434" id2="17" version="1065353216">No thanks. The First Son himself called me to battle. I won't go back to being some Jedi's sidekick.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536436" id2="17" version="1065353216">I took no pleasure in it. They forced my hand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536436" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those deaths were unfortunate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536437" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lucky for me, I get to enjoy my duties.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536439" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're the one who turned on your friend, then slaughtered your own men.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536439" id2="17" version="1065353216">Me? What about your crimes?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536440" id2="17" version="1065353216">Simple survival. If they were no threat, I let them go. You didn't give the other Children any such courtesy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536442" id2="17" version="1065353216">Took me a while to find the master startup code, but it was worth it. This is for my brothers and sisters.</text>
