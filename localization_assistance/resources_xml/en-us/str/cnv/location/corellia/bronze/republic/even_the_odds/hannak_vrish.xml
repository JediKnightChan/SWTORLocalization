		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234398" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, I'll buy a moon. Moons are so much more poetic.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234399" id2="17" version="1065353216">A little bird tells me you've taken care of those cameras. You should know certain... parties wagered on you failing.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234401" id2="17" version="1065353216">I, of course, took the smart bet. But my conscience insists I give you a share of the winnings.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234402" id2="17" version="1065353216">Much appreciated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234403" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure there's a military hospital somewhere that could use some charity.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234403" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should donate the rest.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234404" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, yes--not to mention the tax benefits involved.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234406" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't hold out on me, Vrish.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234407" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a fast learner. Very well, hopefully this will suffice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234409" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who's betting that I'd fail?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234409" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want names.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234410" id2="17" version="1065353216">All anonymous bets. But does it matter? They're considerably poorer--and wiser--now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234412" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're part of the war effort, my bet on the Empire losing looks rosier than ever. Perhaps I'll buy a planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234414" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is rewiring a few cameras really so difficult? Think what's at stake.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234417" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, friend, your eyes don't deceive you. I am indeed Hannak Vrish, grand master of the Gilded Descent's gaming tables.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234419" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, friends, your eyes don't deceive you. I am indeed Hannak Vrish, grand master of the Gilded Descent's gaming tables.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234421" id2="17" version="1065353216">But now that the Republic has made the Descent their headquarters, I find myself seeking diversion elsewhere. And this war has provided plenty of opportunities to wager.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234422" id2="17" version="1065353216">How unfeeling.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234423" id2="17" version="1065353216">A master's skills must be honed. Especially in the current climate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234425" id2="17" version="1065353216">And to better oneself.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234426" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, before I devote myself entirely to repentance, would you hear a small proposal?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234428" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you want a &quot;diversion,&quot; you could defend your world instead of getting rich on its destruction.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234428" id2="17" version="1065353216">How about picking up a rifle?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234429" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I have an obligation to live--for myself, and my admirers. However, that doesn't mean I can't contribute.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234431" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rumor is you brought down a Hutt's business empire in one sabacc game. Took everything he had, right down to his backscratcher.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234431" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've heard of you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234432" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought that was a nice touch. But we digress.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234434" id2="17" version="1065353216">How can you literally gamble on people's lives?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234434" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're making bets on the war?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234435" id2="17" version="1065353216">People will die regardless of where I spend my credits. Though, so much death is a waste.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234437" id2="17" version="1065353216">Quite the ego you have.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234438" id2="17" version="1065353216">To deny one's gifts is to deny oneself. But, let us speak of lesser things.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234440" id2="17" version="1065353216">You see, I have a sizeable sum resting on the Empire losing this war. And I dislike having my investments threatened.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234442" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire has appropriated several hidden cameras that I installed nearby, years ago. Very unsporting. Especially since, with a little rewiring, those cameras could spy for the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234443" id2="17" version="1065353216">And help you win your bet.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234444" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, yes. Why shouldn't patriotism be rewarding?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234446" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one installs hidden cameras without a good reason.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234446" id2="17" version="1065353216">What were these cameras for?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234447" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leverage. Some of my sabacc rivals are rather indiscreet.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234449" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hardwiring the cameras for Republic use should be elementary--though the Empire might have objections. Tread lightly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234451" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't think so. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234452" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh. Perhaps your bet lies in the other direction?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234454" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry. No autographs today.</text>
