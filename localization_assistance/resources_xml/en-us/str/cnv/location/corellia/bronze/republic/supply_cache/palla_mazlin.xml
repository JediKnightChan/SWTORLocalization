		<text bitflag="3393" id1="233995" id2="17" version="1065353216">The resistance may still pull through because of you--and thank you for listening.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="233998" id2="17" version="1065353216">The supply cache! And it's mostly intact--oh, thank you. I'll see the resistance gets it before I... before I leave.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234000" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was supposed to help the resistance and I failed. That can't happen again. I'm returning to Tython; I can't do any more harm there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234001" id2="17" version="1065353216">Think how much good one Jedi could do on Corellia--especially a Jedi who's really learned from her mistake.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234001" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you're needed here.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234002" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... well, I have been thinking over what I would have done differently. And we have the supplies... I could try again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234004" id2="17" version="1065353216">That seems like a good idea.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234005" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Council will be disappointed, I'm sure, but I must follow my feelings.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234007" id2="17" version="1065353216">Enough melodrama.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234008" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be sure to... meditate on that.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234010" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you again for your help. Here, I never had a chance to use this against the Imperials. No doubt you'll have the opportunity.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234012" id2="17" version="1065353216">What good am I really doing here if I couldn't even keep those supplies safe?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234013" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperials bomb Corellia, attack civilians, turn our leaders against us. And now they're stealing from us, too?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234015" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forgive me. I should be setting an example, I know. But who'd want me as a role model?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234017" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire found one of our supply caches and started looting it. I couldn't stop them; I almost died trying. Those supplies were for the Corellian resistance. I failed them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234018" id2="17" version="1065353216">Such events test our resolve. Stay strong and learn from this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234018" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't give in to despair.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234019" id2="17" version="1065353216">Others shouldn't suffer just so I can learn a lesson.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234021" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can't predict consequences.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234022" id2="17" version="1065353216">But that's not good enough, I should have been better, or faster, or--something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="234024" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't blame yourself. You did your duty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234024" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, it's the Empire's fault.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234025" id2="17" version="1065353216">My duty is to stop the Empire and help the Corellians. I've failed at both.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234027" id2="17" version="1065353216">You Jedi don't have it easy.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234028" id2="17" version="1065353216">It certainly brings up certain... questions for me. But those must wait.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234030" id2="17" version="1065353216">How are your injuries?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234031" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll live. But I should have died fighting, if it meant stopping the Imperials.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234033" id2="17" version="1065353216">Life isn't fair.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234034" id2="17" version="1065353216">That supply cache had medicine, emergency barricades, shield emitters. The Corellian resistance could make a fortified position if I got them back.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234036" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I can't. They need those supplies, but the Imperials will just cut me down if I go after them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234037" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me get them.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234038" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's... a very noble offer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234040" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not afraid of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234041" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then you're bolder than I am.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234043" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. The resistance shouldn't suffer because of my failure. I'll be waiting for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="234045" id2="17" version="1065353216">Train harder. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234046" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then those supplies are as good as lost.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="234048" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is hopeless.</text>
