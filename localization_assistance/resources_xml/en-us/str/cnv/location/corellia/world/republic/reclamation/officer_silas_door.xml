		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690460" id2="17" version="1065353216">Officer? The monitor stations are down, and the area is secure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690461" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't tell you how good it is to see you in person.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690463" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now the Republic can mount a real defense without the Imps looking over their shoulders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690465" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm going to get my squad out of here before anyone comes looking. Thanks for your help, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690466" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your men seem pretty hurt; do you need help getting out?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="690466" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can you make it out safely?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690467" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're tough. We'll make it, now that you've cleared the way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="690469" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm only doing my job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690470" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still, you've saved us and more importantly, you've poked a stick in the Empire's eye.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690472" id2="17" version="1065353216">Somebody else might not have been good enough to save you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="690472" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're lucky I was there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690473" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think pretty highly of yourself, but I guess you've earned the right to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690475" id2="17" version="1065353216">When the Republic makes its move, the Imps will never know it's coming. I'll look forward to seeing you there, friend.</text>
