		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488453" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, Councillors. Looks like it's just you and your angry constituency now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488457" id2="17" version="1065353216">With the Empire gone, we can start to rebuild. Corellia thanks you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488459" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've done all I can. Freeing Corellia is up to the Republic now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488461" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm a common criminal now. You and I have nothing to say to each other.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488464" id2="17" version="1065353216">Acting CorSec command can arrest heads of state with the Republic's approval. I want all of them. Councillor Belos, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488466" id2="17" version="1065353216">But... I spied on the Empire. I lied to a Sith Lord. I risked my life to help the Republic!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488468" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were the first to suggest we join the Empire, Belos. How many credits were you offered to change your mind?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488469" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this true, Councillor Belos?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488469" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't know that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488470" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire made overtures, and I introduced them to the council. Does that even matter now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488472" id2="17" version="1065353216">It does to me. It matters to every man, woman and child who died trying to undo it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488474" id2="17" version="1065353216">You might want to switch sides while there's still time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488474" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire's losing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488475" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not all of us are as fickle as Councillor Belos. We believe in the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488477" id2="17" version="1065353216">You might win back Corellia, but the Empire will win the war. We chose the side that will survive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488479" id2="17" version="1065353216">Half of Corellia is in ruins because you refuse to change yours.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488479" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least he helped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488480" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one expected the transition to be easy. But the Republic turned some minor resistance into an all-out war.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488482" id2="17" version="1065353216">The real Corellia rioted in the streets. CorSec launched full-scale attacks on the Empire. There was nothing minor about it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488484" id2="17" version="1065353216">How can you defend joining the Empire?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488484" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a hypocrite.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488485" id2="17" version="1065353216">You may be too young to remember the Sacking of Coruscant, but we're not. The Republic didn't have a chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488487" id2="17" version="1065353216">Which planet do you think would have been next? We did what was best for Corellia.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488489" id2="17" version="1065353216">How many credits were you offered to keep it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488489" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're one to talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488490" id2="17" version="1065353216">We joined the Empire only to save Corellia.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488492" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire has resources and proven strength. We were planning for the future.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488494" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can argue with each other in jail.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488494" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everyone shut up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488495" id2="17" version="1065353216">Corellia is not a democracy. Joining the Empire didn't require the people's approval.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488497" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have no right to arrest us. We acted well within the confines of the law.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488499" id2="17" version="1065353216">The council made themselves kings at Corellia's expense. They all deserve to be punished.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488500" id2="17" version="1065353216">Councillor Belos got us here. He's more than made up for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488500" id2="17" version="1065353216">Belos goes free.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488501" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know if I'll ever make up for it. But I won't let a chance to try go to waste. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488503" id2="17" version="1065353216">I appreciate what he did for us, but you just let a traitor go free.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488505" id2="17" version="1065353216">You all started this war. Nothing can make up for that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488505" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lock them all up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488506" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take note, Captain Cantarus. This is how the Republic repays her allies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488508" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only the ones who join the Empire, Councillor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488510" id2="17" version="1065353216">General Aves will want a status update. Give us a minute to restore communications in here. Can you hear us, General?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488512" id2="17" version="1065353216">Coming through fine, Captain. Without the Corellian Council's advice, the Empire's falling back on old tactics. They're not working.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488514" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once the Legislature falls, the Empire will be vulnerable. I've got several squads ready to push them off Corellia, but they'll need a signal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488516" id2="17" version="1065353216">Broadcast comm in the Speaker's Courtyard. Your signal will hit every comm station on Corellia--if you can reach it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488517" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's the Speaker's Courtyard?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488517" id2="17" version="1065353216">Speaker's Courtyard?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488518" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Legislature's open-air garden. Every big speech in Corellian history was made there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488520" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can reach it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488521" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Imperials get the signal, they'll have time to prepare.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488521" id2="17" version="1065353216">This sounds risky.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488522" id2="17" version="1065353216">It'll be too late. Once the Legislature falls, the Republic will have control. But we have to get there first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488524" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Speaker's Courtyard is being protected by Darth Decimus, the last of the Dark Council members sent to Corellia.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488526" id2="17" version="1065353216">He convinced the Corellian Council to join the Empire. He won't let Corellia go easy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488528" id2="17" version="1065353216">You won't have any backup here. CorSec's holding the council, the Green Jedi are defending their enclave, and my men are in position.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488529" id2="17" version="1065353216">Darth Decimus won't expect an ambush.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488529" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry about us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488530" id2="17" version="1065353216">He'll be prepared for one. Don't let his men distract you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488532" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't come this far to lose Corellia now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488532" id2="17" version="1065353216">That won't stop me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488533" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad to hear it. But remember Darth Decimus is thinking the same thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488535" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll have the Force on my side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488535" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Jedi is never alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488536" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just remember it only takes one good shot to kill someone, Jedi or no.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488538" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm a soldier. It's not my first suicide mission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488538" id2="17" version="1065353216">Business as usual.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488539" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hopefully it won't be your last.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488541" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been saving a few tricks for a fight like this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488541" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll get by somehow.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488542" id2="17" version="1065353216">Use everything you've got. If we lose the Legislature, we lose Corellia.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488544" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever it takes to beat the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488544" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're in command.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488545" id2="17" version="1065353216">Reinforcements are dead weight anyway.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="488545" id2="17" version="1065353216">And good riddance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488546" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's hope that works both ways. Every Imperial we didn't catch will be holed up inside.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488548" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once you've defeated Darth Decimus, contact me on the broadcast comm. I'll be waiting for your signal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488550" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is it. One Sith Lord between us and freedom. Corellia's counting on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="488552" id2="17" version="1065353216">Deal with Darth Hadra first. Then we can talk.</text>
