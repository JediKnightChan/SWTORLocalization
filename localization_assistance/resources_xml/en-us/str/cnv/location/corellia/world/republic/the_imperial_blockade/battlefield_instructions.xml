		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690386" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our dropships are bringing additional troops. They'll clear out any stray Imperials, but they need homing beacons to follow.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690388" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our injured have a rendezvous point nearby. Get there and contact me once you've activated the homing beacons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690390" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're past the zoo and close to Imperial territory now. Scanners have picked up a group of Imperial walkers headed our way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690392" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do what you can to put those walkers out of commission. You'll be crossing enemy lines to reach them, so stay sharp.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690394" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our troops have reached the Coronet Zoo. They're reporting Imperial snipers firing from inside.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690396" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take out the snipers, but be careful. There's plenty of places at the Coronet Zoo for them to hide.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690398" id2="17" version="1065353216">The trenches are along far enough now. Our long-range artillery camps are under attack, and the troops need help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="690400" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get to those camps, stop the Empire, and make sure the artillery's still functioning.</text>
