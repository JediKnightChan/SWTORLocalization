		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522554" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is Watcher Three to Cipher Nine. Things are a little... chaotic without Keeper, so I need a minute to pull our files on Voss.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522556" id2="17" version="1065353216">In the meantime, I did want someone more familiar, but... ah.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522558" id2="17" version="1065353216">Apologies for the wait. Playing catch-up with our friends in the Diplomatic Service, but we think we can brief you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522559" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't realize we had an expert on board.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522559" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know about Voss, Vector?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522560" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said it's &quot;chaotic&quot; there... tell me the truth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522560" id2="17" version="1065353216">How bad are things at HQ?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522561" id2="17" version="1065353216">The military and the Sith aren't happy with our output, and I can't blame them. Master Hyllus, can you...?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522563" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522565" id2="17" version="1065353216">Has losing Keeper reduced us to asking advice from friends and family?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522565" id2="17" version="1065353216">We must really be desperate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522566" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Diplomatic Service has more experience with Voss than anyone. Certainly more than me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522568" id2="17" version="1065353216">We never served on Voss personally. It's a newly discovered world, home to a simple, humanoid civilization.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522570" id2="17" version="1065353216">One species, one government, one city--Voss-Ka.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522572" id2="17" version="1065353216">Primitive. They didn't even have spaceflight when we made first contact.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522574" id2="17" version="1065353216">But they have art and laws and culture. More importantly, they have citizens who can use the Force--not Jedi or Sith, but something different.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522575" id2="17" version="1065353216">New Force users could change the balance of power.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522575" id2="17" version="1065353216">That must've brought interest.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522576" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're going too fast. Tell me more about the Voss species.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522576" id2="17" version="1065353216">What sort of people are they?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522577" id2="17" version="1065353216">Their whole culture is based on solidarity--loyalty and obedience to family and to the edicts of the Mystics.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522579" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those are the Force sensitives. Healers and fortune-tellers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522581" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do they have to do with the Star Cabal?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522581" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care about the natives.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522582" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll get to that. Keep going, Vector.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522584" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Voss Force sensitives are called Mystics. They're healers and fortune-tellers, utterly revered and considered infallible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522586" id2="17" version="1065353216">We want the Voss and the Mystics to ally with the Empire. The Republic is petitioning them, too... yet they remain stubbornly neutral.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522588" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course, half the galaxy has spies there. Who wouldn't?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522590" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keeper's files clearly indicate conspirator involvement, but no names or details. All I've got are instructions for a meet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522591" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take the bait. What was her plan?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522591" id2="17" version="1065353216">Give me the lead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522592" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keeper wasn't one to follow hunches.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522592" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why was she so convinced?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522593" id2="17" version="1065353216">I agree. She saw something in these files I don't. I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522595" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do we know anything about this meet?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="522595" id2="17" version="1065353216">So I'm going in blind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522596" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's a teahouse in Voss-Ka proper. You're supposed to wait for a contact--he'll identify himself with the phrase &quot;anew as the spring.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522598" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know who he is or whether Keeper told him about the Star Cabal, but he'll know more than I do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522600" id2="17" version="1065353216">Assuming he's in one piece.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522602" id2="17" version="1065353216">Assuming that. Watcher Three out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="522604" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll await your instructions.</text>
