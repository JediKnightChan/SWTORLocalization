		<text bitflag="321" id1="1174068" id2="17" version="1065353216">Attention outsiders and potential allies: Dangerous mercenaries have allied with the Gormak. 

They trade combat training for Gormak weapons and cybernetic upgrades.

The mercenaries slaughtered several Voss commando units sent to break the alliance.

Eliminate the cyber-mercenaries and material rewards will be granted.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1174069" id2="17" version="1065353216">Attention outsiders and potential allies: The Gormak madness grows. 

The Thalak tribe camps in the boneyards. These Gormak walk the Nightmare Lands without fear. They return changed. 

Now the Thalak tribesmen build new machines. Each one has the strength of ten. Voss commandos fight them by dozens, and die.

Outsiders who destroy the Thalak tribe will be rewarded. Speed is necessary. Voss-Ka trembles.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="1174070" id2="17" version="1065353216">Attention outsiders and potential allies:

Material reward is authorized for the defeat of the Gormak &quot;Savage Slayers.&quot;

These new beastmasters use corrupt Gormak devices to draw strength from their cyber-abominations.

They are stronger than any Gormak and cannot be defeated while their beasts live.

Defeat the beasts, defeat the slayers.</text>

The Trial of the First Commando begins. Voss commandos gather below the shrine to train in battle. Fearless outsiders may participate.

First Commando Nakar-Sel and fellows wait to defeat challengers. Nakar-Sel drives back Gormak armies. He will not spare you.

The healers speak: None shall die. All pain will be real. Victory will be true.</text>
