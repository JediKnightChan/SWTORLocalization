		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572266" id2="17" version="1065353216">Outplaying Raklann at his own game. Quite marvelous; well done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572269" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Voss are greatly pleased by what you've done. Meet with Major Kouvar at Pelath Point. Raklann's time has come.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572272" id2="17" version="1065353216">Speak with Captain Ortano concerning the threat to the Voss. And see that the Gormak chieftain pays for his crime.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572275" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah. Back, not a moment too soon. But first--excellent work securing the ruins. Our reclamation teams were able to do a proper survey.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572277" id2="17" version="1065353216">They confirmed my suspicions: Raklann found an ancient, forgotten Sith device, and used it to adapt his weapons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572279" id2="17" version="1065353216">Without that device, Raklann has lost his advantage. We can finally turn our attention to crushing that... beast, before he does any further damage!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572280" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you learn what this device was for?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572280" id2="17" version="1065353216">What was this device?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572281" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was one of many we found in a crumbling Sith laboratory. All destroyed now. Wonders cannibalized for spare parts by a monster!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572283" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forgive me. Matters have escalated in your absence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572285" id2="17" version="1065353216">You seem agitated. Why?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572286" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been looking forward to taking care of Raklann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572286" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's about time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572287" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll soon have your chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572289" id2="17" version="1065353216">Raklann has renewed his attacks on our Voss allies. One of his chieftains murdered a healer Mystic and the Imperial soldiers protecting her. The Voss are beside themselves with rage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572290" id2="17" version="1065353216">We broke Raklann's toys, so he's decided to hurt us in return.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572290" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is a deliberate affront.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572291" id2="17" version="1065353216">Beings who can heal any injury are in short supply. It would be careless to lose any more.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572291" id2="17" version="1065353216">A shame. Mystics are useful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572292" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should have hired pros. Bucketheads aren't trained for protection detail.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572292" id2="17" version="1065353216">Soldiers make bad bodyguards.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572293" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now is hardly the time to be soliciting more business, hunter!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572295" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's few greater tragedies in Voss society than the killing of a Mystic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572295" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course they're angry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572296" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do we respond?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572297" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're not the ones who killed their Mystic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572297" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Voss shouldn't blame us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572298" id2="17" version="1065353216">Raklann was cast out because our soldiers destroyed his tribe. To the Voss, we are culpable for his actions now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572300" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Voss are demanding action. We must placate them, swiftly. Publicly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572301" id2="17" version="1065353216">Appeasing the Voss is important, but there's no point if Raklann's free to do more damage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572301" id2="17" version="1065353216">Raklann should be priority.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572302" id2="17" version="1065353216">All things in time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572304" id2="17" version="1065353216">How, exactly?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572305" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then placate them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572306" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are all well-known and liked on Voss, your involvement will send the right message.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572308" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your deeds on Voss are well-known; your involvement will send the right message.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572310" id2="17" version="1065353216">There are rumors the Gormak are building a new weapon to use against the Voss. I ordered Captain Ortano to look into it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572312" id2="17" version="1065353216">And the chieftain responsible for the Mystic's death must be hunted down. If you did these things, it would calm the Voss, freeing us to pursue Raklann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572313" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Mystic's death is a hard thing to make up for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572313" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's hope this works.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572314" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Voss lose faith in us, our work here has been for nothing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572316" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leave it with me, Lord Pallas.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572317" id2="17" version="1065353216">Know what calms me? Money.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572318" id2="17" version="1065353216">You will be compensated. Later.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572320" id2="17" version="1065353216">Trivial, but I'll do it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572321" id2="17" version="1065353216">A last item. There was one survivor from the attack on the Mystic, a Major Kouvar. He claims to have insight into Raklann's plans.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572323" id2="17" version="1065353216">When your business is complete, meet with the major at Pelath Point. Discover what he knows. Then use it to crush Raklann under your heel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572327" id2="17" version="1065353216">Find Vex Dantos, and that astromech droid, TM-82. They should know more about the situation in the ruins.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572330" id2="17" version="1065353216">A curious region, these marches, don't you think? Among these ruins, the footprints of battles... old and new.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572332" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope you like fighting Gormak. Raklann's brought several tribes under his banner, and they're proving a real trial to exterminate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572333" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nothing can withstand the might of a Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572333" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572334" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll make ourselves stronger by defeating them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572334" id2="17" version="1065353216">It'll be a healthy challenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572335" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just let me at them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572336" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm afraid it's not that simple.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572338" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gormak aren't difficult to outmaneuver, if you know what you're doing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572338" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe your tactics need work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572339" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have fought Gormak for years, my friend. But I haven't fought Raklann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572341" id2="17" version="1065353216">Raklann's the key to all this. I should know everything you do about him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572341" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want to know about Raklann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572342" id2="17" version="1065353216">That would be little; he's an outcast Gormak who blames us for his exile. And he's surprisingly cunning.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572344" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought Raklann's forces were just Gormak warriors. What's the problem?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572344" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why is that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572345" id2="17" version="1065353216">Raklann's men are using weapons we've never seen before. Unsophisticated, naturally, but they cut through shields and armor very effectively.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572347" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've lost more squads than I care to count to those weapons; unless we deprive Raklann of his technological advantage, we will lose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572348" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Raklann's weapons are this good, defeating his forces might be difficult.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572348" id2="17" version="1065353216">So I'm at risk, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572349" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your equipment appears to be light-years from standard issue; you should fare better than my men.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where did Raklann get weapons like that in the first place?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where are these weapons from?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572352" id2="17" version="1065353216">He adapted them from technology he found, as Gormak always do. The question is, what technology did he find?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572354" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not to Gormak, we won't.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572355" id2="17" version="1065353216">There is another anomaly. The ruins in this area--Gormak usually shun and fear such ruins, but Raklann's men study them freely.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572357" id2="17" version="1065353216">I believe his exploration of those ruins may explain his new weapons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572358" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't mind investigating those ruins myself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572358" id2="17" version="1065353216">The ruins interest me, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572359" id2="17" version="1065353216">This whole area seems to be covered in old ruins. What was here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572359" id2="17" version="1065353216">What were these ruins, anyway?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572360" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Pelath-Ri Marches have the remains of both Jedi and Sith structures, many are still a mystery.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572362" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should find out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572363" id2="17" version="1065353216">And where do I come in?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572364" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would speak to Vex Dantos. He was overseeing a Sith ruin that the Gormak have taken an interest in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572366" id2="17" version="1065353216">An astromech droid also reported a Republic excavation nearby; if it's a new discovery, it should be secured before Raklann's Gormak raid it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572368" id2="17" version="1065353216">Best of luck. Oh, and please feel free to annihilate any Gormak forces you run across.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572372" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have much to organize; please excuse me.</text>
