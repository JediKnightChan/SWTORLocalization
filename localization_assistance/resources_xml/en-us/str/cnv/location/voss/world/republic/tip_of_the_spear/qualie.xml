		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572025" id2="17" version="1065353216">The ship will sink, and its darkness will be snuffed out. Because of your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572028" id2="17" version="1065353216">A ship. An ancient Sith starship. This was the Gormak's Evuk-Nosk?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572030" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not just a relic, then. Worse. A working Sith vessel in the hands of the Gormak... catastrophic.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572032" id2="17" version="1065353216">Voss-Ka could have been destroyed in days. The Gormak could even have gone offworld with this ship, and conquered. No wonder they searched so hard.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572033" id2="17" version="1065353216">The ship was affecting Nodin-Fe's mind. Anyone who used it would have been in terrible danger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572033" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was tainted by darkness.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572034" id2="17" version="1065353216">The marsh is the ship's proper place, yet I can't help wondering what stories it had to tell.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572034" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wonder what its history is.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572035" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. We researched inscriptions of a Sith Lord who brought many weapons and droids to Voss. Might be his ship. Or even his tomb.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572037" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Gormak have wasted a lot of troops and resources hunting for this thing. They'll be less dangerous for a while.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572037" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now they're less of a threat.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572038" id2="17" version="1065353216">An appropriate irony, correct?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572040" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whenever something should stay buried, you can guarantee some idiot will turn up with a shovel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572040" id2="17" version="1065353216">It probably won't stay lost.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572041" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. This terrible ship is dangerous, tainted by evil. It must be forgotten.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572043" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's our next move?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572044" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then this is over.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572045" id2="17" version="1065353216">This terrible ship. Tainted, and dark. It must remain sunk forever.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572047" id2="17" version="1065353216">But to keep this ship buried will take Republic aid. Hmm. Organization, people, resources. Could use military assistance.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572049" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've done much. Could you do a little more? Take this message to Lieutenant Randa in Voss-Ka? We can't risk a transmission being intercepted.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572050" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will, but don't forget the Voss. I'm sure they'd be happy to keep the ship away from the Gormak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572050" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe the Voss could help too.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572051" id2="17" version="1065353216">Would be diplomatic. I'll invite them, see what they say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572053" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572054" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I'm headed that way.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572055" id2="17" version="1065353216">You saved so many. Voss and Republic civilians. And the Gormak, from falling to an ancient evil.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572057" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. May the Force be with you always.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572061" id2="17" version="1065353216">Remember. Don't risk the marshes while those Gormak relays are still live.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572064" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. Organized. All heavily armed. Clearly more than simple reinforcements, therefore....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572066" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. A fellow of the order. Clearly powerful, perhaps even the one who slew Darth Angral. Therefore....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572068" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. A fellow of the order. Obviously capable, strongly resembles the current Barsen'thor. So....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572070" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. Republic uniform. Special Forces insignia; Havoc Squad. Never seen Special Forces here before. So....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572072" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. Hardly armed, shabbily dressed, yet managed to survive here despite hostile forces. Meaning....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572074" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. Well armed and equipped. Obviously didn't come here by chance. Therefore....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572076" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've come to help with the Gormak, and this Evuk-Nosk they're looking for. Correct?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572077" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Halykus said you might need help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572077" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must be Padawan Qualie.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572078" id2="17" version="1065353216">So he remains well. Good to know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572080" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, that's correct.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572081" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think you've been around the Voss a little too long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572081" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're weird.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572082" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are as you are. I simply observe.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572084" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Halykus sent me his notes on the Evuk-Nosk. Fascinating, just missing a conclusion.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572086" id2="17" version="1065353216">Geological records and recent Gormak actions suggest the Evuk-Nosk once rested near the dam, but was carried away in the great flood. Carried here. Somewhere nearby.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572087" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Halykus mentioned a flood, but I'm not clear on the details.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572087" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about this flood.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572088" id2="17" version="1065353216">This was Gormak territory. The flood came--origins uncertain. The Gormak left, the Evuk-Nosk was washed away. Eventually, the Voss built the dam.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572090" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're sure it's here?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572091" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Gormak believe so. All evidence points to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572093" id2="17" version="1065353216">I feel like I've been chasing after this thing forever.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572093" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sick of this search.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572094" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then be happy. You're close.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572096" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Voss in the camp, Nodin-Fe, talks of something lost in the marshes. It's hard to understand him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572098" id2="17" version="1065353216">But Nodin-Fe says what's lost is old, and dangerous. And the Gormak are in the marshes. The Evuk-Nosk--must be.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572099" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Gormak see me near their relic, they'll bring everything they have to stop me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572099" id2="17" version="1065353216">It'll be hard to get close.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572100" id2="17" version="1065353216">Correct. The Gormak are using relays of some sort to coordinate. Need to handle those, first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572102" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't mind a chance to study this relic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572102" id2="17" version="1065353216">And it must be fascinating.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="572103" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Gormak aren't just going to hand this thing over for the asking, are they?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572103" id2="17" version="1065353216">This might get messy.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572104" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. Might even have trouble getting close.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572106" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nodin-Fe, you said?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572107" id2="17" version="1065353216">If it's not, I'll be angry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="572108" id2="17" version="1065353216">If it's not, I'll be angry.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572109" id2="17" version="1065353216">Time is not open to waste.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572111" id2="17" version="1065353216">First, ensure the Gormak can't call for aid. They've been using communication relays of some kind; not my field.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572113" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ask Ethen Wessiri and his assistant. Quite smart, rather single-minded. They'll help you with the relays. Then see what Nodin-Fe has to say.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="572117" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hello.</text>
