Material reward is authorized for the defeat of the Gormak &quot;Savage Slayers.&quot;

These new beastmasters use corrupt Gormak devices to draw strength from their cyber-abominations.

They are stronger than any Gormak and cannot be defeated while their beasts live.

Defeat the beasts, defeat the slayers.</text>
