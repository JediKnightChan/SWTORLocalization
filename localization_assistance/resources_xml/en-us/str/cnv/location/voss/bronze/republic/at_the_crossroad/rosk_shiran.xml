		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85463" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks again. Got a lot of food for thought.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85464" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look at this city. And the Voss--they're so serene. Imagine being able to trust every word your leaders say.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85466" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been a while since I had that kind of faith in people. Working... behind the scenes, does that to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85467" id2="17" version="1065353216">Recognizing that is a step forward. Maybe visiting Voss will be good for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85467" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's never too late to change.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85468" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope so. It's been a real eye-opener so far.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85470" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blind faith is as dangerous as paranoia. There's nothing wrong with being cautious.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85470" id2="17" version="1065353216">Trust needs to be earned.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85471" id2="17" version="1065353216">Paranoia's kept me alive, but that's not the same as really living.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85473" id2="17" version="1065353216">This war's taking its toll on everyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85473" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're all making sacrifices.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85474" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know, infantry has it worst. But at least your battles are out in the light.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85476" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not trusting politicians, fair enough. But if you can't trust anyone, where does that leave you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85476" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must believe in something.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85477" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know. Even having to ask is depressing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85479" id2="17" version="1065353216">You mean, you're an SIS agent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85480" id2="17" version="1065353216">You mean, you're an SIS agent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85481" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're very forthcoming.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85482" id2="17" version="1065353216">Heh, sorry. Looks like the Voss are having an effect on me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85484" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've spent years trying to help the Republic win. Did a lot of things I'd rather forget. Then I see the Voss.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85486" id2="17" version="1065353216">Secret ops, political ploys... they don't exist for the Voss. They don't need them. And I keep wondering if I still do. Maybe it's time to walk away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85487" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should consider it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85488" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a big decision. But, Voss strikes me as a good place for a fresh start.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85490" id2="17" version="1065353216">The work you do protects people like the Voss. This kind of peace wouldn't be possible without you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85490" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you save innocent lives.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85491" id2="17" version="1065353216">True. I suppose the Voss would say, everything has to balance out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85493" id2="17" version="1065353216">You took on the responsibility of keeping people safe. You can't abandon that because of a moment of weakness.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85493" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't be selfish.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85494" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't pull any punches, do you? Hah. But that doesn't make you wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85496" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll think about it. Sorry, I didn't mean to drop all this on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85498" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks for listening. Here--I've had this since my first solo mission. Maybe it'll bring you luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85500" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's so peaceful here compared to Coruscant; you can hear yourself think.</text>
