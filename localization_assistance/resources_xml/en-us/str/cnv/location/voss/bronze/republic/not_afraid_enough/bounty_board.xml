		<text bitflag="321" id1="917338" id2="17" version="1065353216">Attention outsiders and potential allies: The Gormak madness grows. 

The Thalak tribe camps in the boneyards. These Gormak walk the Nightmare Lands without fear. They return changed. 

Now the Thalak tribesmen build new machines. Each one has the strength of ten. Voss commandos fight them by dozens, and die.

Outsiders who destroy the Thalak tribe will be rewarded. Speed is necessary. Voss-Ka trembles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="963265" id2="17" version="1065353216">Attention outsiders and potential allies: The corruption of the Nightmare Lands spreads. These lands are eaten by darkness.

Outsiders--Imperial and Republic--ignore our warnings. They enter the Nightmare Lands. Madness eats them.

Now the madmen return, and build. These craftsmen create shrines. Around these shrines, the Nightmare Lands' corruption devours faster.

Evil drives the craftsmen to build. Voss will seek answers from the Mystics. Outsiders must see the shrines, and their craftsmen, destroyed.</text>
