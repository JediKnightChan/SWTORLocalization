		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85699" id2="17" version="1065353216">We shouldn't be seen speaking to each other. It isn't safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85700" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85702" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you Girr Antoc?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85703" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes. And you are the one I've been waiting for.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85705" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am honored, of course, to help you in this transition. But I must admit that I'm also slightly confused.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85707" id2="17" version="1065353216">From what little information I could gather, you've served the Empire quite well. Why change sides?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85708" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've grown tired of the petty fools who call themselves Sith. I will join you in destroying them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85708" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Sith are too weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85709" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... see. That isn't the usual explanation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85711" id2="17" version="1065353216">My fellow Sith are hunting me for the secret knowledge I possess. I need to escape.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85711" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was betrayed!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85712" id2="17" version="1065353216">Secret knowledge? That's very interesting. The Republic would certainly never betray you in such a way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85714" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperials and Sith think they're better than everyone. I'm tired of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85714" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sick of the Imps.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85715" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, they are quite certain of their own superiority, aren't they?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85717" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've seen how Republic people live. That's the life I want.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85717" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want your way of life.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85718" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course. It must seem very appealing compared to the overbearing lifestyle that's been forced on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85720" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lots of credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85721" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm in it for the credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85722" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh. I... didn't realize you had already discussed financial compensation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85724" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't question me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85725" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry if my question upsets you. That isn't my intent.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85727" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must understand my concern at your motives. This is a time of war, after all--we need to know who we can trust.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85728" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can trust me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85729" id2="17" version="1065353216">I certainly hope so.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85731" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who you trust is your concern.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85732" id2="17" version="1065353216">Most defectors would be trying a bit harder to prove that their intent is genuine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85734" id2="17" version="1065353216">You fear me, don't you?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85735" id2="17" version="1065353216">I do not think it is unreasonable to be cautious, given the circumstances.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85737" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've met with me--that is the first step. You'll be contacted in the future with a location to surrender yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85739" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should go now, before anyone sees us speaking. Good luck to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85741" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm busy.</text>
