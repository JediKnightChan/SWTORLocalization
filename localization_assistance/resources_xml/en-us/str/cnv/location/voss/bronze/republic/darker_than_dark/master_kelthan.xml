		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85231" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lost souls still wander the Nightmare Lands, but not for Lord Renik. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85233" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Kelthan. Lord Renik is dead. He was guarding these tablets.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85234" id2="17" version="1065353216">These tablets must contain the source of Lord Renik's power. The lost are no longer under his control.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85236" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps something here can help restore them fully. I will study these in greater detail. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85238" id2="17" version="1065353216">We must locate the source of Lord Renik's power before others fall under his sway.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85241" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have you felt it, young Jedi? That tremor? The knowledge that something is wrong?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85243" id2="17" version="1065353216">A moment, if you please. Whatever your business, you have time for a warning.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85245" id2="17" version="1065353216">Madness is not the only danger in the Nightmare Lands. There are those who have learned to wield the darkness here.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85247" id2="17" version="1065353216">They will prey on your confusion and bend you to their will. Their power cannot be explained, but must be stopped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85248" id2="17" version="1065353216">I completed the ritual of cleansing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85248" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm perfectly safe out here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85249" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any way I can avoid going crazy?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85249" id2="17" version="1065353216">How can I protect myself?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85250" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Mystics' ritual will protect you from madness. What of those already lost?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85252" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need more information.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85253" id2="17" version="1065353216">Talk about confused....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85254" id2="17" version="1065353216">I may be old, but my eyes still work. What I've seen here could threaten us all.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85256" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Sith named Lord Renik has found a way to control the lost souls wandering the Nightmare Lands. Voss and Gormak alike.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85258" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know his methods, or how he avoided madness himself. But he controls a small army now. It must end.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85259" id2="17" version="1065353216">Without joining his army.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85260" id2="17" version="1065353216">How much control does Lord Renik have?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85260" id2="17" version="1065353216">How far does this power go?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85261" id2="17" version="1065353216">Enough to matter. The lost follow Lord Renik. They defend him, even against their own.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85263" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Voss wouldn't like this if they knew.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85263" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't have to fight alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85264" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've appealed to the Voss many times. They believe Lord Renik to be as mad as his men.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85266" id2="17" version="1065353216">Has Lord Renik targeted anyone specifically?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85266" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's Lord Renik planning?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85267" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not yet. But once he has the number he desires, I doubt he will turn them on the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="85269" id2="17" version="1065353216">An army of loons won't get him very far.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85269" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lord Renik's wasting his time.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85270" id2="17" version="1065353216">The lost are Voss commandos, Gormak warriors. They could kill if Lord Renik orders it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85272" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a Jedi. Go end it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85273" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was young like you once. But I no longer have the strength to resist the darkness.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85275" id2="17" version="1065353216">Were I to venture out and confront Lord Renik, I would only become another of his slaves. You are stronger than that.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85277" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must find Lord Renik and discover the source of his power. If not for me, then for the lost souls that serve him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85278" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll do my best to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85279" id2="17" version="1065353216">Me to the rescue again.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85280" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let us hope your pride does not become your weakness.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85282" id2="17" version="1065353216">The coordinates where Lord Renik was last seen. Be sure you are prepared to face him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="85284" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too dangerous. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85285" id2="17" version="1065353216">We cannot allow fear to prevent us from doing our duty.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="85287" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tread carefully here, young one. The Nightmare Lands are aptly named.</text>
