We warned the Republic: Do not bring your walkers into these lands. The Gormak covet them. We were ignored.

Now your walkers are destroyed. The Gormak claim their technology to make more machines. Many Voss will die.

Outsiders erred. Outsiders must make amends. Reclaim your walker parts and bring them to safety. Will you ignore us again?</text>
