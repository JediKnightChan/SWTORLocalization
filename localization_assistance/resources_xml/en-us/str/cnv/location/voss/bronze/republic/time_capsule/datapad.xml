Weeks aboard the ship, and we step out into this wonderland. Never seen anywhere so lovely. Smells so alive.

Ran into a native scouting party yesterday. They weren't pleased to see us; even took a shot at Captain Janney.

I'll try and keep notes however busy we get. This is the chance of a lifetime, angry natives or not.

[It may be worth seeking out the other datapads left by the explorers.]</text>
