[The Gormak's hidden stronghold is on the outskirts of Gormak territory at the base of Voss-Ka. Disrupt the meeting of Gormak leaders and kill the warlords.]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="963591" id2="17" version="1065353216">Attention outsiders and potential allies: Commando Ferlu-Da seeks fearless volunteers.

Voss commandos fight to reclaim these lands. But Gormak guard towers watch. They guide the Gormak warriors, and commandos die.

A proposal. Imperial volunteers attack the Gormak guard towers and set them alight. Commandos will see, and strike the Gormak supply lines.

Voss are generous. Bring fire to the Gormak, and commandos will share the spoils outsiders crave so much.</text>
