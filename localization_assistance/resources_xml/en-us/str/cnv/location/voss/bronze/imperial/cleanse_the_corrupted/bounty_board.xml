		<text bitflag="321" id1="917339" id2="17" version="1065353216">Outsiders and potential allies: Voss commandos defied the law and entered the Nightmare Lands. Unthinking bravery. Corruption has overtaken them.

It has destroyed their minds, but enhanced their bodies. They wield strange powers and command wild beasts. Darkness seeps beyond the Nightmare Lands' borders.

Bring the warriors a merciful death. End their suffering. The Voss will be grateful. Material reward offered.</text>

A Science Bureau research team, code-named Project Chimera, successfully observed unusual changes in many non-native life-forms imported to Voss.

Project Chimera recently ceased responding to communications. Its findings are vital to hazardous Imperial operations on Aaris Three and Sebiris.

The Science Bureau now seeks any surviving data from Project Chimera's survey stations in the Nightmare Lands. Reward offered.</text>
