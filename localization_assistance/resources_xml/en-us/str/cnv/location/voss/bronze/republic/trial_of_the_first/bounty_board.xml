The Trial of the First Commando begins. Voss commandos gather below the shrine to train in battle. Fearless outsiders may participate.

First Commando Nakar-Sel and fellows wait to defeat challengers. Nakar-Sel drives back Gormak armies. He will not spare you.

The healers speak: None shall die. All pain will be real. Victory will be true.</text>
