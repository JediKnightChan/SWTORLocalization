A known vassal of Raklann and already responsible for numerous crimes, Althu is now under death sentence as an enemy of the Empire.

A generous bounty will be paid for Althu's swift destruction. Standard pay is offered for any additional hazards.

Althu has fled to a defensive position near the Err-Ka dam within the Pelath-Ri Marches. Coordinates are provided.</text>
