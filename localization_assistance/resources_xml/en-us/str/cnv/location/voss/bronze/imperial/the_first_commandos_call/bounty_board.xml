The Trial of the First Commando opens below the shrine. Only the greatest Voss commandos participate. They duel and grow strong.

First Commando Nakar-Sel hears of your Empire's strength. He speaks: Prove it against him, and the commandos who make Gormak weep.

The healers watch. There will be injury, but none shall die. If you do not fear pain, win pride.</text>
