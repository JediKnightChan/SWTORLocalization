		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288897" id2="17" version="1065353216">This area is going to be a tug of war. It's a good thing you saved those men--we're going to need everyone we can get.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="288901" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your men have been released, and the enemy is on the run.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288908" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope my men are still alive. I'm waiting for your signal that all is secure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="288912" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you have men in danger, you'd better stop berating yourself and do something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288912" id2="17" version="1065353216">Start acting like an officer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="288913" id2="17" version="1065353216">That is a Jedi philosophy as well, Captain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288913" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't abandon our allies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="288916" id2="17" version="1065353216">If soldiers are in danger, you'd better stop whining and do something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288916" id2="17" version="1065353216">Buck up, Captain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="288919" id2="17" version="1065353216">I sometimes make a habit of pulling Republic soldiers' butts out of the fire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288919" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe I can help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288931" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go on the attack.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288932" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those men deserve every effort. But what's left of my forces couldn't come close to success.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288934" id2="17" version="1065353216">It would be suicide for us. I'd just end up getting more good soldiers captured and killed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288936" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds terrible.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288937" id2="17" version="1065353216">Something must be done. My men deserve a chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288943" id2="17" version="1065353216">You got it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288944" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then there's hope. You're an inspiration.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="288946" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm doing this for your men, not for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288946" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll fix your mess.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288947" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're right, I failed them. It'll haunt me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288955" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just made it out of there. Please give me some space so I can gather my wits.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495096" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agent Moritt is waiting for you!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495102" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're here! Master Jedi, you made it! You're just in time!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495104" id2="17" version="1065353216">Major! You actually made it! I can't tell you how glad I am to see you, sir--we're in a real mess here!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495106" id2="17" version="1065353216">You! You're the one Agent Poz told me about--you made it! We really need your help!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495108" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm Captain Devlin, First Recon. We had established a beachhead and started data collection, just like the SIS ordered, but then we got swarmed!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495110" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was those blasted Esh-kha. We fell back to here, but some of my people didn't make it. No telling what those freaks are doing to them....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495112" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please--get my men out of there. We'll need their help to hold this position, and you'd be be landing a good first strike on those Esh-kha monsters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="495113" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495114" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please--don't leave them to die. Not like that.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495116" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll hold here and keep our eyes open. If you manage to save anyone, come on back and let me know.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="495118" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck--and thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="918486" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did it! You actually did it! I can't thank you enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="918488" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll make sure the survivors get patched up. You keep pushing ahead and contact me from one of the deeper monitoring stations.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="918490" id2="17" version="1065353216">By the time you're in position, we should have a lead on the main Esh-kha force. Watch your back.</text>
