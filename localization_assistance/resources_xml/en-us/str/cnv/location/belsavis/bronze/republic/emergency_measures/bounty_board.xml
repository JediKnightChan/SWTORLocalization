Authorization: Warden Graal; General Skylast

Rioters have taken control of the southwestern quadrant of the Maximum Security Section. Request immediate assistance to this area.

Top priority is activation of quarantine fields and prisoner restraint collars. Jamming prevents remote activation, but manual activation at emergency stations remains a possibility. Emergency station locations and activation procedures are in attached schematics.

Satellite imaging and infrared scans suggest the rioters include Force-users and are heavily armed! If these control measures fail, estimate sixteen hours before Maximum Security is lost.</text>
