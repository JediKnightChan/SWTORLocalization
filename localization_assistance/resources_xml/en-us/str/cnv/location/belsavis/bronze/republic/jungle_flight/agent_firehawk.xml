		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289186" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm transmitting Mynock's report to my superiors. Thanks again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289188" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your Agent Mynock didn't make it. But we ran across his datapad and files.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289189" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry, your Agent Mynock didn't make it. But I found his datapad and files.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289190" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blast it. Another good man lost to this place. May I see that?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289192" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is... everything I needed. Mynock always came through. Looks like we've got some arrests to make.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289194" id2="17" version="1065353216">SIS owes you a favor. For now, take this. And watch your back out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289196" id2="17" version="1065353216">Mynock's already taken enough risks for us. Please, don't keep him waiting.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289197" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excuse me. Agent Firehawk, with the Strategic Information Service.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289199" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd like to request the assistance of the Jedi Order in a... difficult matter.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289201" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know Havoc Squad isn't under SIS jurisdiction, but I'm formally requesting your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289203" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have a... difficult matter to handle, and I could use some outside help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289205" id2="17" version="1065353216">I normally work alone, but if you're interested, I need a team to conduct a tough assignment.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289207" id2="17" version="1065353216">Before the breakout, I had an agent, Mynock, planted among the prisoners. He &quot;escaped&quot; with the others to keep his cover, and I've lost contact.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289208" id2="17" version="1065353216">To stick to his duty, even now--that's impressive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289208" id2="17" version="1065353216">He must be dedicated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289209" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have strange methods.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289210" id2="17" version="1065353216">Espionage isn't safe. We had to get inside the heads of a dozen Republic traitors, this was our best bet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289212" id2="17" version="1065353216">One slipup and those prisoners would have eaten him for breakfast.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289212" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a risky operation.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289213" id2="17" version="1065353216">Mynock's got guts. He sat in that cell eavesdropping on traitors for over a year.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289215" id2="17" version="1065353216">Someone gets out of jail, they've got places to go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289215" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, he just got his freedom.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289216" id2="17" version="1065353216">Amusing. Here's your punch line: Mynock may have secrets from Republic traitors that he needs to report.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289218" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who was he spying on?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289219" id2="17" version="1065353216">Mynock was observing Republic traitors, filth who sold our secrets to the Empire. I want what they know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289221" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe he defected.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289222" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe he defected.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289223" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's possible he went rogue. He was deep undercover, among Republic traitors. But I hope not.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289225" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agent Mynock has a tracking device implanted, of course, but the signal leads into a network of caves. Preliminary data says they're crawling with native fauna.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289227" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's high time Mynock was extracted, I need him found. Would you be willing?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Consider it done.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289229" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks. I can tell you where these caves are, but they haven't been mapped properly. Be careful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289231" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about Mynock's cell mates? You said he was preserving his cover.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289231" id2="17" version="1065353216">And the other prisoners?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289232" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm pulling the plug. If they cooperate, fine--otherwise, do whatever's necessary.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289234" id2="17" version="1065353216">Remember, Mynock is priority one. His report could expose dozens of Republic traitors; our security's at stake.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289236" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289237" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I need to call for an extraction team. I hope Mynock can keep it together until then.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289239" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry, no time to chat.</text>
