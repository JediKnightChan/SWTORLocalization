		<text bitflag="321" id1="289713" id2="17" version="1065353216">[The monolith pulses with the life force of Subject 13.]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289715" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lord Mohgren told me you would be here. I am his apprentice, and--Subject 13? You defeated him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289716" id2="17" version="1065353216">Subject 13 said I had to sacrifice myself for his freedom. That wasn't going to happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289716" id2="17" version="1065353216">He forced my hand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289717" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can still release him. If this prison permitted his death, he would have killed himself centuries ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289719" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're late.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289720" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have no excuse. Luckily, the prisoner is only weakened. If his death were possible here, he would have killed himself centuries ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289722" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does he look alive to you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289723" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm, well, you've weakened Subject 13, but he still lives. If death provided an escape, he would have killed himself centuries ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289725" id2="17" version="1065353216">Subject 13. You have been vanquished. Now take my mind, and serve the Empire. It is your only choice!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289727" id2="17" version="1065353216">He obeys. Tell Lord Mohgren of my glory!</text>
