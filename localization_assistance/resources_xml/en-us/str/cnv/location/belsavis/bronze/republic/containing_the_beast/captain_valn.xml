		<text bitflag="1345" id1="289389" id2="17" version="1065353216">The doors are sealed. That creature won't be getting out anytime soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289390" id2="17" version="1065353216">You actually pulled it off? That's a huge relief.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289392" id2="17" version="1065353216">With that monster locked down, we'll have a much better shot at getting things under control. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289393" id2="17" version="1065353216">No problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289394" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no telling how many lives you saved. That monster would've torn our people apart.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289396" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've had way tougher tasks.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289397" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I guess we were lucky you were around to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289399" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's everything, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289400" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't ask you for anything more.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289402" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stay safe down there.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289404" id2="17" version="1065353216">You again? Either get those doors welded, or get out of there before it's too late!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289407" id2="17" version="1065353216">What the...? I thought Devlin and his men were all gone from that section! You need to get out of there!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289409" id2="17" version="1065353216">Something very big and very nasty is tearing its way out of one of the holding vaults! You need to start running, understand?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289410" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can we stop this thing?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289411" id2="17" version="1065353216">You could try to seal the blasted thing in, if you're crazy enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289413" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can handle myself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289414" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't tell me what to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289415" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is that supposed to scare me?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289416" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're going to stay down there, you'd better do something to keep that beast from getting out.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289418" id2="17" version="1065353216">Grab a welding torch from one of our droids' supply drops. You can use that to seal up the doors to the creature's cell.</text>

		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289422" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welding the doors should keep the thing contained until we can get the situation back under control. Otherwise, that blasted monster will kill everything it lays eyes on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289423" id2="17" version="1065353216">Got it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289424" id2="17" version="1065353216">You really are crazy. Good luck to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289425" id2="17" version="1065353216">No sweat.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289426" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just watch yourself--that monster isn't the only thing that's dangerous down there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="289428" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget it. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="289429" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then do yourself a favor and get out of there while you can.</text>

		<text bitflag="3393" id1="969767" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're alive? What about that monster...?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="969769" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not seeing any indications that its cell was sealed properly. You actually killed that thing...?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="969771" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha! Maybe we can bring things under control after all. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="336" id1="969772" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe a reward is in order?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="969773" id2="17" version="1065353216">After that? I'll see what I can do.</text>
