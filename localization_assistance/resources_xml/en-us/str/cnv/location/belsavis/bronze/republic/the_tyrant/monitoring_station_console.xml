		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288661" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is it done? Has the Tyrant's uprising been quelled?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="288662" id2="17" version="1065353216">The threat is ended. He is no more, and the explosives he set have been destroyed.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288663" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well done. You have made the galaxy a safer place, and put my mind at ease. Now I can concentrate fully on my healing.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288665" id2="17" version="1065353216">May the Force be with you, my friend.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="288669" id2="17" version="1065353216">[You activate the monitoring station terminal and set it to the Republic frequency.]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288671" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come in, come in, priority one, priority.... Ah, finally, we have a presence in that sector. Well met, friend, I am Master Shohn-Lowt.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288673" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've arrived just in time. I'm sure you have urgent business of your own, but will you hear me out?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288675" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't dawdle.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288676" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't dawdle.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288677" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be as brief as I can be.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288679" id2="17" version="1065353216">Guess so.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288680" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doesn't bother me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288681" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your cavalier attitude seems out of touch with what's going on here. And with what's at stake.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288683" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Sith Lord known as the Tyrant has broken free of his cell. Before his capture, he murdered thousands and had dreams of galactic conquest.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288685" id2="17" version="1065353216">I sent him here decades ago, had the warden droids take him to the deepest section, but now he's trying to free other dangerous inmates and make his escape.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288686" id2="17" version="1065353216">It must not happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288687" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd join you myself, but I was badly wounded when the Esh-kha flooded the area.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288689" id2="17" version="1065353216">Isn't this your mission?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288690" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm badly wounded, can't proceed. Was making my way to the Tyrant's cell when the Esh-kha flooded in. Barely escaped with my life.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288692" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you asking of me?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288693" id2="17" version="1065353216">Isn't it clear? Perhaps you cannot tell that I'm badly wounded. When the Esh-kha flooded the area, I barely escaped with my life.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288695" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Tyrant is using Republic munitions to blast holes through the prison walls, trying to create an exit for himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288697" id2="17" version="1065353216">He'll release hundreds of the galaxy's most dangerous criminals. I need you to destroy all the explosives he's setting up and stop him for good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288698" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sound thinking.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288700" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sound thinking.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288702" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;For good,&quot; huh?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288705" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is grave work we must sometimes do.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288707" id2="17" version="1065353216">The galaxy will suffer unimaginably if the Tyrant orchestrates his freedom. I'll await word from you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288708" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose so.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288709" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't tell you how terribly the galaxy will suffer if this madman orchestrates his freedom.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288711" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope you find the time to avert this disaster. I'll await your word.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="288713" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not today. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288714" id2="17" version="1065353216">If this madman is released, the galaxy will suffer in unimaginable ways.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="288716" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please relinquish the console--maybe someone with some guts will show up.</text>
		<text bitflag="321" id1="288718" id2="17" version="1065353216">[This monitoring station appears to be deactivated.]</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="709053" id2="17" version="1065353216">Certainly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="709054" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're right.</text>
