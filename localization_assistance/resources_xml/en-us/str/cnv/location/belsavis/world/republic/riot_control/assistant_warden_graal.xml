		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530230" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Condemned may be pacified, but there are still plenty of other prisoners on the rampage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530231" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kill every last one of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530232" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's too late. We held them off for a while, but they broke through. Most of our personnel fell back to the armory, but Kelsa....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530234" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was a model officer... those animals cut her down without a second thought.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530236" id2="17" version="1065353216">Would've been a massacre if you hadn't warned us about that disruptor. They'll die for this--the Condemned, the Imperials... and Nyranos.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530237" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you wanted to resolve all this without violence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530237" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where's your restraint?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530238" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've exhausted my mercy. If those maniacs want a bloodbath, I say we give it to them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530240" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you wounded?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530241" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry about me. I'll live.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530243" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll hunt down every last one of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530243" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll get them for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530244" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do what you have to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530246" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're barricaded in the control room. We prevented them from slicing the central terminal remotely--now they're trying to access it manually.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530248" id2="17" version="1065353216">I saved one of the magnetar rifles for you. Should get you through the security fields. Get in there and finish this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530249" id2="17" version="1065353216">I saved a few magnetar rifles for you. Should get you through the security fields. Get in there and finish this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530251" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's high time we restored order to this place.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530252" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good news--we finally have a lead on the Condemned's ringleader. Found this holorecording on one of Playt's assassins. Take a look.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530254" id2="17" version="1065353216">Brothers, sisters--I am Nyranos. Like you, I was born into captivity, shackled by the crimes of my ancestors.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530256" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our forefathers rot in the bowels of this prison, their debt to the Republic repaid in full. Yet here we remain, guiltless.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530258" id2="17" version="1065353216">We must stand united against this injustice. Together, we will tear down these walls and seize our freedom!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530260" id2="17" version="1065353216">He goes on from there, but you get the idea. This guy is bad news--he's cunning, ruthless, and worst of all, charismatic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530261" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like he has every reason to be upset.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530261" id2="17" version="1065353216">He actually has a point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530262" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't buy into the whole &quot;hero of the people&quot; routine. He's injected just enough truth into his rants to rally his followers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530264" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530265" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't underestimate him. He was born and raised on Belsavis, and we don't breed pushovers here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530267" id2="17" version="1065353216">So we've got a name and a face. Doesn't bring us any closer to stopping him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530267" id2="17" version="1065353216">That wasn't much of a lead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530268" id2="17" version="1065353216">Actually, this little tirade told us more about him than we could have hoped for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530270" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nyranos is dangerous, but he's just a puppet. The Empire's been using him to provoke the inmates. Fortunately, they slipped up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530272" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's right. I isolated several audio cues from the recording and got a fix on its origin. Could be their headquarters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530274" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is the break we've been waiting for. Now that we know where they're hiding, we can finally take the fight to them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530275" id2="17" version="1065353216">The sooner we quell this riot, the better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530275" id2="17" version="1065353216">No time to waste.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530276" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well said.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530278" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why are Imperials fraternizing with convicts?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530278" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why is the Empire involved?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530279" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire's been egging them on in hopes of escalating the riots. May get more than they bargained for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530281" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been itching for a little payback.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530281" id2="17" version="1065353216">About time we hit them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530282" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hear that. Won't feel right until they've paid for Warden Playt's murder.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530284" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nyranos and his Imperial cohorts are the brains behind the Condemned. We take them out, we end this riot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530286" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get to their hideout. If Nyranos is there, eliminate him; otherwise, find out what they're up to. Any insight could go a long way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530287" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hopefully the Force will provide an alternative to violence. You just stay here and keep an eye on the station.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530287" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll do what I can.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530288" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530290" id2="17" version="1065353216">Won't Nyranos's death just rile the prisoners even further?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530290" id2="17" version="1065353216">Killing him could backfire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530291" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hate to make a martyr out of him, but letting him run loose is even riskier.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530293" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hopefully this Nyranos is there--I'll take a fighting mission over recon any day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530293" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like the first option.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530294" id2="17" version="1065353216">In that case, good hunting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530296" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't wait to see the look on their faces when I roll in there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530296" id2="17" version="1065353216">This'll be good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530297" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry I won't be around to see it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530299" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530300" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530301" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too overt. They'll run if they think we're onto them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530303" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hang onto those stun grenades Kelsa gave you. Kill the Imperials if you like, but again, I'd prefer the prisoners were subdued non-lethally.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530305" id2="17" version="1065353216">Contact me when you've cleared out the base. I'll be waiting for your report.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530307" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome back. Glad to see you made it--and with all the rifles, no less.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530309" id2="17" version="1065353216">I appreciate you keeping the body count to a minimum. Last thing we need is to provoke the rioters even further.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530311" id2="17" version="1065353216">With the shield generator online and the magnetar rifles back in our hands, we'll be safe for a while. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530312" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any other weapons I should be worried about the prisoners getting their hands on?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530312" id2="17" version="1065353216">No more surprises?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530313" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just the usual assortment of blasters and vibroblades.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530315" id2="17" version="1065353216">My pleasure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530316" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're proving yourself a real asset around here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530318" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know. I'm amazing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530319" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wish I had fifty more like you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530321" id2="17" version="1065353216">On that note, I just received intel from Republic Command that those Condemned lunatics have already responded to our shield restoration.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530323" id2="17" version="1065353216">They just hit another armory. This one's unique, though--stocked with all kinds of prototype weaponry, including our new magnetar rifles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530324" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm assuming that's a weapon of some kind?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530324" id2="17" version="1065353216">Magnetar rifles?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530325" id2="17" version="1065353216">More or less.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530327" id2="17" version="1065353216">I take it we don't want a horde of angry prisoners getting their hands on these rifles?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530327" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll assume that's bad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530328" id2="17" version="1065353216">Got that right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530330" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not ringing any bells. Must be some kind of new ordnance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530330" id2="17" version="1065353216">Magnetar rifles?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530331" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're cutting edge, all right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530333" id2="17" version="1065353216">A magna-whatsit?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530333" id2="17" version="1065353216">Magnetar rifles?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530334" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not surprised you haven't heard of them. Few have.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530336" id2="17" version="1065353216">How does this affect the station's security?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530336" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's the big deal?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530337" id2="17" version="1065353216">Worst-case scenario? The station won't have any security.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530339" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those prisoners really have the run of the place, don't they?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530339" id2="17" version="1065353216">This has to stop.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530340" id2="17" version="1065353216">Told you it was bad. This latest development certainly doesn't help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530342" id2="17" version="1065353216">The magnetar rifles were specifically designed to disrupt energy shields. The technology's experimental, but effective.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530344" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our security fields won't last against one of those things. A single shot takes a while to load up, but it could punch right through our defenses.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530345" id2="17" version="1065353216">Send me the armory's coordinates. I'll deal with the Condemned myself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530345" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll secure those rifles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530346" id2="17" version="1065353216">Send us the armory's coordinates. We'll deal with the Condemned ourselves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530346" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll secure those rifles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530347" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just make sure you get all the weapons--a single unaccounted rifle could compromise the station's security.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530349" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why would you even carry that kind of weaponry?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530349" id2="17" version="1065353216">Odd thing for you to have.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530350" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kept a few on hand after some prisoners got loose and barricaded themselves in their cells. Never thought they might be used against us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530352" id2="17" version="1065353216">How is this a surprise? Of course they'd go after a shield-destroying weapon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530352" id2="17" version="1065353216">You didn't expect this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530353" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did we anticipate it was possible? Yes. Did we have the manpower to do anything about it? No.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530355" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need you to get to that armory and secure those weapons. Those maniacs escape with even one rifle, it's over for us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530357" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bring the rifles back to the station once you've retrieved them. Graal out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530359" id2="17" version="1065353216">Try not to kill anyone, if you can. There's been enough death already.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530361" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here, these stun grenades should take the fight out of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530363" id2="17" version="1065353216">That'll do. Bring the rifles back to the station once you've retrieved them. Graal, out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530364" id2="17" version="1065353216">Graal, here. Looks like that did it--the security fields just went up. And not a moment too soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530366" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even better, that boost jump-started the station's internal generators. We're rerouting power to them now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530367" id2="17" version="1065353216">That means the prisoners won't be able to knock out the fields again, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530367" id2="17" version="1065353216">So the station's secure?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530368" id2="17" version="1065353216">For the time being.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530370" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excellent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530371" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're not in the clear yet, but it's a start.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530373" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got a lot more work cut out for us, don't we?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530373" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is just the beginning.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530374" id2="17" version="1065353216">Afraid so.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530376" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did good. And thank you for looking after Kelsa. She's only a junior corrections officer--I'd hate to see anything happen to her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530378" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get Kelsa to that generator in one piece. I'm counting on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530379" id2="17" version="1065353216">Seal off the wing! No one gets in or out without my say-so. Kelsa--how's the warden?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530381" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dead, sir. Clean shot to the head. I think that makes you the new warden.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530383" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah. I... hadn't thought of that....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530384" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now isn't the time for doubt, warden. These people need you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530384" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can do this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530385" id2="17" version="1065353216">Playt wouldn't have chosen you as his successor if he didn't trust you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530385" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll do fine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530386" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose you're right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530388" id2="17" version="1065353216">The chain of command is there for a reason, warden. Time to buck up and take charge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530388" id2="17" version="1065353216">Accept your responsibility.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530389" id2="17" version="1065353216">All right. I'll do what I can for now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530391" id2="17" version="1065353216">Congrats on the promotion. Too bad about Playt, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530391" id2="17" version="1065353216">Always a silver lining.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530392" id2="17" version="1065353216">Playt may have been a bit of a curmudgeon, but he performed his duties admirably.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530394" id2="17" version="1065353216">How'd those prisoners even get in here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530394" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your security is lacking.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530395" id2="17" version="1065353216">Like Playt said, our defenses are pretty much nil right now. Didn't realize just how vulnerable we were, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530397" id2="17" version="1065353216">Quit stalling and give us a game plan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530397" id2="17" version="1065353216">Less talk. More action.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530398" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry, this is just... unexpected. The warden was a good man.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530400" id2="17" version="1065353216">Securing this station is our first priority--another ambush like that and we're through.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530402" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our security fields should keep the prisoners out. But some Condemned saboteurs trashed the field generator-- the whole network is down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530404" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leave it to me, sir. A few tools, a little elbow grease, and I'll have that generator back up in no time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530406" id2="17" version="1065353216">That generator could still be crawling with prisoners. I'd feel a lot better knowing someone was watching her back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530407" id2="17" version="1065353216">She'll be safe. You have my word.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530407" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leave it to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530408" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll hold you to that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530410" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've got guards. Have them escort her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530410" id2="17" version="1065353216">One of you can't do it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530411" id2="17" version="1065353216">Until those fields are up, I need all security personnel defending the station. Afraid that just leaves you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530413" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just let me slip into something more blaster-resistant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530415" id2="17" version="1065353216">The generator isn't far. Just keep those lunatics away from Kelsa. Give 'em one for the warden.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530417" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's more like it. I'll be waiting for you just outside the station. Come get me when you're ready to head out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="530418" id2="17" version="1065353216">Won't be me. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="530419" id2="17" version="1065353216">Cancel that, Kelsa. I don't want you going out there alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="537910" id2="17" version="1065353216">That should do it. Throw the switch and cross your fingers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="763639" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is pathetic.</text>
