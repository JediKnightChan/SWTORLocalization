From Agent Brandis, Imperial Intelligence:

I am posting this message on encrypted Imperial terminals across the galaxy for fear the electronic mail system is insecure. Even with that precaution, I can say little more than you are urgently needed on Belsavis. The Imperial Guard has made a shocking discovery, and without your assistance, we may miss the largest opportunity of the war. I entreat you to meet me at the orbital station above Belsavis as soon as possible.

Respectfully,
Brandis</text>
