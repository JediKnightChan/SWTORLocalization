		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508340" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hawkins, take Rawaat and check the north tower. If the prisoners have it, let me know and I'll send reinforcements.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508341" id2="17" version="1065353216">You bought us some valuable time, thanks. They're loading up the civilians now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508342" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you still doing here? You've got to get that transport to those civis, or the prisoners will tear them apart!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508344" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Jedi, I could sure use your help. The prisoners are going from building to building, attacking everyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508346" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's major, right? I'm sure glad to see you. The prisoners are going from building to building, attacking everyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508348" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hope you're a quick shot with that blaster; the prisoners are killing everyone out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508350" id2="17" version="1065353216">Worse, I've got civilians hiding in the prisoner intake yard. If the convicts find them, it'll be a massacre.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508351" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is a prison. Where did civilians come from?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Civilians?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508352" id2="17" version="1065353216">Many of the guards bring their families with them. It's good for morale, but now they're in danger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508354" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doesn't sound like a safe place to hide.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508354" id2="17" version="1065353216">How'd they end up there?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508355" id2="17" version="1065353216">When the riots started, it was the best we could do--I moved the guards' families there for protection.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508357" id2="17" version="1065353216">What sort of idiot allows civilians on a prison facility?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508357" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must've really messed up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508358" id2="17" version="1065353216">The guards are allowed to bring their wives and children. It's a long tour out here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508360" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're moving them offworld as soon as possible. I managed to scare up an armored transport.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508362" id2="17" version="1065353216">Problem is there's an army of bloodthirsty convicts between the transport and the guards' families.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508363" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll clear the prisoners out of the area.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508363" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leave that to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508364" id2="17" version="1065353216">I knew I could count on you. Just be careful--they aren't showing anyone mercy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508366" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you need from me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508367" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not going to be pretty, I wish I could tell you otherwise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508369" id2="17" version="1065353216">Trust me, these prisoners haven't seen bloodthirsty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508369" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm in the mood for violence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508370" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sometimes that's all they understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508372" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need you to clear a path for the transport so it can get to those civis. The prisoners are going to throw everything they've got at you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508374" id2="17" version="1065353216">Honestly, I wouldn't send a womp rat on this suicide run... but I'm out of options. Can you do it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508375" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your transport is safe with me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508375" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take care of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508376" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force protects us, and I am its servant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508376" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take care of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508377" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll clear the way for your transport.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508377" id2="17" version="1065353216">Affirmative.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508378" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like my odds more than the womp rat's. I'll take care of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508378" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508379" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks. With you on the job, I can concentrate on bringing other areas under control.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508381" id2="17" version="1065353216">Point me to the transport, and I'll head out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508381" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where do I go?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508382" id2="17" version="1065353216">The rioters already captured the main power station, so the transport's currently charging its power cells at our reserve.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508384" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll need to clear a path from there to the prisoner intake yard. That should buy enough time to get the civilians.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="508386" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do it. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508387" id2="17" version="1065353216">Great. If any of those civilians get hurt, I'm holding you personally responsible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="508389" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry, no time to talk now. I've got my hands full just keeping people alive.</text>
