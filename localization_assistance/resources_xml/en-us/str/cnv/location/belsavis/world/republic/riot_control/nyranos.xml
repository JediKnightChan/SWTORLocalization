		<text bitflag="1345" id1="548782" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do you work this thing? This antiquated tech is older than--Nyranos! Company.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549337" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll prove our worth to the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549338" id2="17" version="1065353216">My own men... throwing me to the Imperials for a few credits. Only a lifetime in prison will breed that kind of desperation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549340" id2="17" version="1065353216">But please, put down your weapon and let us speak. No one else needs to die today.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549342" id2="17" version="1065353216">But please, put down your weapons and let us speak. No one else needs to die today.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549344" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would have negotiated sooner, but those Imperial watch dogs wouldn't allow it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549345" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought they were your allies. Why the sudden change of heart?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549345" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not with the Imperials?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549346" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire's aims were never ours. They extended a helping hand only to catch us by the throat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549348" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've already lost. You don't have anything to barter with.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549348" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why should I negotiate?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549349" id2="17" version="1065353216">You may have killed the Imperials, but my confederates are still out there, armed and eager to fight. I'd prefer we avoided further bloodshed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Give me one reason why I should let you live.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549351" id2="17" version="1065353216">I ought to kill you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549352" id2="17" version="1065353216">Despite what the wardens may have told you, there's no need for us to be enemies. I wish only to talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549354" id2="17" version="1065353216">But if words are not enough, allow me to prove my sincerity.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549356" id2="17" version="1065353216">Attention, my fellow Condemned--this is Nyranos. Lay down your arms. It's time we resolved this... peacefully.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549358" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stop right there, you murdering scum! You won't poison this prison anymore!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549360" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why are you just standing there? Kill that lunatic so we can end this madness!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549361" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Jedi never kills without reason, Graal. Let's hear what he has to say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549361" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not how I do things.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549362" id2="17" version="1065353216">Mediation is the first step toward peace, Graal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549362" id2="17" version="1065353216">That won't solve anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549363" id2="17" version="1065353216">A good soldier knows when to fight and when to talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549363" id2="17" version="1065353216">This isn't the time for that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549364" id2="17" version="1065353216">Uh, Graal? You're kind of ruining this whole &quot;peaceful resolution&quot; thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549364" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need to relax.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549365" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not going to listen to that madman, are you? How can you just forget everything he's done?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549367" id2="17" version="1065353216">Butt out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549368" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you think I'll just stand by and watch a bunch of convicts overrun my prison....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549370" id2="17" version="1065353216">I figured you'd want to be here when he died.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549370" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was just waiting for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549371" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wait! At least hear me out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549373" id2="17" version="1065353216">Neither I nor any of the Condemned have ever been convicted of a crime. We merely inherited our ancestors' sentences.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549375" id2="17" version="1065353216">All we want is our freedom--perhaps a small piece of land on Belsavis where we can live in peace. We deserve that much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549377" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only thing this nutcase deserves is a blaster bolt between the eyes. If you don't kill him, I will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549379" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've heard our demands; do what you will. Just know that I'll die before I return to that cell.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549380" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nyranos is willing to forget the past, Graal--it's time you did the same. Do the right thing and help him settle his people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549380" id2="17" version="1065353216">These people are innocent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549381" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... yes, you're right. This has gone too far.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549383" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll have your freedom, Nyranos--but you're going to work for it. I expect you and your people to help us restore order here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549385" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed. And thank you for seeing reason. We will not forget this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549386" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm just glad we were able to settle this without any more violence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549386" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a relief.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549387" id2="17" version="1065353216">As am I.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549390" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stay out of trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549391" id2="17" version="1065353216">We fought hard for this freedom. We're not about to squander it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549394" id2="17" version="1065353216">This sector is more or less secure now, but a Colonel Hauer has been asking for assistance in the high security wing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549396" id2="17" version="1065353216">I told him I didn't have any men to spare, but that you might be able to lend a hand. He's expecting you now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549398" id2="17" version="1065353216">You go on ahead--we've got things under control here. Just be careful. The innermost wings are real madhouses.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549399" id2="17" version="1065353216">I appreciate you helping us clean up this mess. We're one step closer to getting this place under control.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549401" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a murderer, Nyranos. It's time you paid the price for that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549401" id2="17" version="1065353216">Death it is. [Kill Nyranos]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549404" id2="17" version="1065353216">Finally... some proper justice. I hope Kelsa and Playt are smiling right now, wherever they are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549406" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Condemned won't be happy about this, but without Nyranos or the Imperials to lead them, they won't last long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549408" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll mop them up soon enough. Remind them who's in charge around here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549409" id2="17" version="1065353216">Need a hand rounding up the remaining prisoners?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549409" id2="17" version="1065353216">Want any help?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549410" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, we can take it from here. I'm sure the guards are all anxious to crack a few heads.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549411" id2="17" version="1065353216">My work here is done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549412" id2="17" version="1065353216">Looks like it. Don't know what we would have done without you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549413" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll leave that to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549414" id2="17" version="1065353216">It'll take some time to rally the guards after that last attack, but we'll get it done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549420" id2="17" version="1065353216">This sector is more or less secure now, but a Colonel Hauer has been asking for assistance in the high security wing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549422" id2="17" version="1065353216">I told him I didn't have any men to spare, but that you might be able to lend a hand. He's expecting you now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549424" id2="17" version="1065353216">You go on ahead--we've got things under control here. Just be careful. The innermost wings are real madhouses.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549438" id2="17" version="1065353216">I appreciate you helping us clean up this mess. We're one step closer to getting this place under control.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549442" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Jedi--my grandfather told me of your kind. I see now his stories were true.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549444" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd heard one of the famed Havoc commandos was killing my men. Your reputation is well-deserved, Major.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549446" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your infamy precedes you, Captain. Tales of your exploits have breached even these walls.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549448" id2="17" version="1065353216">At last we meet. You've given me and my men no end of trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549450" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad our paths have finally crossed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549451" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stand down, Nyranos. Put a stop to this madness.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549451" id2="17" version="1065353216">Surrender now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549452" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never. We've come too far to just crawl back into our cells.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549454" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's your game, Nyranos?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549454" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you want?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549455" id2="17" version="1065353216">I seek only justice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="549457" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549458" id2="17" version="1065353216">I expected Graal's hatred would blind him, but I'd hoped you would have more sense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549460" id2="17" version="1065353216">Neither I nor my comrades have committed any crime against the Republic. We will have our freedom, one way or another.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549462" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do shut up, Nyranos. No one wants to hear another speech. Just kill this upstart.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549464" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do shut up, Nyranos. No one wants to hear another speech. Just kill these upstarts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549466" id2="17" version="1065353216">We came to negotiate, Imperial. Fight your own battles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549468" id2="17" version="1065353216">Speak for yourself. I'll take a fistful of Imperial credits over your &quot;crusade&quot; any day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="549470" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least a few of you animals know the meaning of loyalty. As for you, Nyranos, you can die with the rest.</text>
