		<text bitflag="1345" id1="512733" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not one of the guards. What's going on here? No one's telling us anything!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="512736" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got to get our stuff ready to go. Thanks for everything.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="512744" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's what we always fear. We'll get our things--and we'll wait... and hope.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="512745" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right now, you need to get on the transport.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="512748" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your husband's doing his job right now. Help me do mine and get everyone ready to go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="512750" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks. I promise, I'll tell them what's going on once we're under way.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="512752" id2="17" version="1065353216">What? My husband! I have to find him! We can't leave without him!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="512754" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks a lot. That'll make my job easier. You should go. Now.</text>
