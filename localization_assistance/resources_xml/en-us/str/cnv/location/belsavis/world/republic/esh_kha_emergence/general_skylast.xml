		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542647" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha won't be troubling anyone ever again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542650" id2="17" version="1065353216">There you are. We were getting worried. Thought maybe I'd sent you to your death down there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542652" id2="17" version="1065353216">There you are. We were getting worried. Thought maybe I'd sent you all to your deaths down there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542654" id2="17" version="1065353216">General Skylast told me about the World Razer. Hard to believe something like that's been down in the vaults this whole time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542656" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, what happened? Did you stop the World Razer?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542657" id2="17" version="1065353216">The mission was a failure, General. The Esh-kha already freed the World Razer. It will take a long time before it is mobile, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542657" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was too late.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542658" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. Now that'll complicate things.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542660" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd rather not say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542661" id2="17" version="1065353216">That bad, huh?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542663" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll tell the Jedi Council to expect the worst. Maybe something can be done to buy us time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542665" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least we've got advance warning. We'll be ready. You've done the Republic a great service here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542667" id2="17" version="1065353216">The World Razer's been sealed. He won't be going anywhere for a long time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542667" id2="17" version="1065353216">Locked away for good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542668" id2="17" version="1065353216">I handled it. Barely.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542669" id2="17" version="1065353216">Knew I could count on you. Fine work out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542671" id2="17" version="1065353216">The World Razer's not our concern anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542671" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's out of our hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542672" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was hoping for a more thorough debrief, but if you say it's over, I'll take your word for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542674" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't thank you enough for all your contributions. You've done the Republic a real service.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542676" id2="17" version="1065353216">Project Noble Focus would still be up and running if you hadn't exposed Senator Tudos and stopped those Rattataki.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542678" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've made huge strides in restoring order to the minimum security wing. Those Condemned inmates shouldn't trouble us anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542680" id2="17" version="1065353216">And you even took out Gore Claw. Good riddance, I say. That lunatic had it coming.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542681" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess that puts an end to the Esh-kha's plans once and for all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542681" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's finally over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542682" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hate to be an optimist, but it looks like it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542684" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not quite.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542686" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad I could help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542687" id2="17" version="1065353216">That wrap things up?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542688" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha are still on the lam, but they've taken a big hit today.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542690" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still plenty of stragglers, but with Gore Claw dead, a lot of them have started killing each other. Weird, but I can't complain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542692" id2="17" version="1065353216">You put a lot on the line to help us out there. The Republic owes you one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542694" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unfortunately, Gore Claw's death has mobilized the Esh-kha. They're desperate now, and it's only made them more dangerous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542696" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're making their final push off this rock. They've plowed through our defenses--they're just a massacre away from clinching their freedom.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542699" id2="17" version="1065353216">If this World Razer actually exists, waking it up is probably the worst thing the Esh-kha could do. You've got to stop them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542701" id2="17" version="1065353216">Best place to start is the Deep Prison--all kinds of ancient monstrosities sealed away down there. You'll be on your own, though. Watch yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542703" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha won't set foot off this planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542705" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha general is dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542706" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good. Losing their leader will demoralize the Esh-kha; they'll be disoriented and disorganized.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542708" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pretty soon, we'll be able to scatter their forces and drive them back to the vaults.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542709" id2="17" version="1065353216">Looks like you don't need me anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542709" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I leave this to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542710" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wouldn't have lasted without you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542712" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have fun with that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542713" id2="17" version="1065353216">It'll still be a slow, tedious process, but we'll get it done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542715" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can I finally leave?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542716" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think it's safe to say the Esh-kha threat has finally been neutralized. Good work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542718" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha general is dead, but he mentioned something about awakening a &quot;World Razer&quot; that would destroy us all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542719" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wait--the World Razer? He said that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542721" id2="17" version="1065353216">So maybe it is true. This is bad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542722" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha seemed to think this World Razer was going to destroy the planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542722" id2="17" version="1065353216">To say the least.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542723" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, sounds like what you'd expect from a &quot;World Razer.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542725" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have you heard about the World Razer before?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542725" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's true?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542726" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just rumors. Not from the most reliable sources, mind you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542728" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure he just said that to mess with our heads.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542728" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't be gullible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542729" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not so sure. I've heard of this World Razer before.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542731" id2="17" version="1065353216">A few deep-cell inmates were babbling about it. Could barely understand a word they said, much less put any stock in it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542733" id2="17" version="1065353216">Went on about this... thing in the planet's core. Claimed it was massive, as old as the galaxy. I thought it was just superstitious nonsense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542734" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha believe in it. That's enough for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542734" id2="17" version="1065353216">Clearly it has merit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542735" id2="17" version="1065353216">The galaxy is a strange place. Even the most horrible tales can wind up being true.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542735" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't discount anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542736" id2="17" version="1065353216">No sense in taking risks when the Republic's safety is at stake. We need to look into this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542736" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can't take that chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542737" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a big galaxy. Anything's possible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542737" id2="17" version="1065353216">Should've known better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542738" id2="17" version="1065353216">Certainly seen my share of crazy stuff down here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542740" id2="17" version="1065353216">You didn't even bother looking into it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542740" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you ignored it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542741" id2="17" version="1065353216">We were too busy fighting prisoners, Imperials and genocidal monsters to confirm a few spook stories.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542743" id2="17" version="1065353216">A few prisoners and a dying Esh-kha aren't the most reliable sources.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542743" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm still skeptical.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542744" id2="17" version="1065353216">The prisoners' terror looked real enough. And the Esh-kha may be a lot of things, but they're not liars.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542746" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's time we ended this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542747" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've probably guessed the Republic didn't build this place. Was constructed thousands of years ago by a species called the Rakata.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542749" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Rakata hated the Esh-kha--wrote about them like they were a plague. Waged a war that engulfed the entire galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542751" id2="17" version="1065353216">In the end, the Esh-kha were nearly wiped out; the few hundred thousand survivors brought here to be locked away in stasis.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542752" id2="17" version="1065353216">If only the Imperials had known how dangerous the Esh-kha were.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542752" id2="17" version="1065353216">Until the Empire came along.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542753" id2="17" version="1065353216">Idiots were so giddy about making life difficult for us that they didn't notice all the &quot;Do not open&quot; signs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542755" id2="17" version="1065353216">How have I not heard about any of this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542755" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is news to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542756" id2="17" version="1065353216">SIS has been keeping a lid on this whole affair. &quot;Need-to-know&quot; and all that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542758" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Rakata didn't use any discretion when they punished the Esh-kha. Just lumped them all together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542758" id2="17" version="1065353216">Their imprisonment was unjust.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542759" id2="17" version="1065353216">Smart move on their part.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542761" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Rakata could have saved us all a lot of heartache by just killing the Esh-kha.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542761" id2="17" version="1065353216">Should've wiped them out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542762" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha still had their uses. Apparently, the Rakata would pull them out of stasis and unleash them on unruly planets.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542764" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha conquered half the galaxy in their heyday, and they'll pick up right where they left off if they ever escape.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542766" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your raid caught them off guard. They're crippled, shaken. Now's the time to press our advantage and halt their advance for good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542767" id2="17" version="1065353216">The less time we give them to recover, the better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542767" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then let's do it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542768" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you have in mind?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542769" id2="17" version="1065353216">Naturally.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542771" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think that pretty much goes without saying.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542771" id2="17" version="1065353216">No kidding.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542772" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've traced the bulk of the Esh-kha's comm activity back to a small cavern. We think they're using it as a command station.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542774" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whoever's in there is coordinating the Esh-kha's entire offensive. It's our best shot at taking out their leadership. I want you to take it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542775" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're putting a lot of trust in me. I won't let you down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542775" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm honored.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542776" id2="17" version="1065353216">If it will put an end to this madness.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542776" id2="17" version="1065353216">I accept.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542777" id2="17" version="1065353216">I haven't let you down yet. Hadn't planned on starting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542777" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't fail.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542778" id2="17" version="1065353216">I do best when the stakes are high.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542778" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good choice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542779" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's just get it done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542780" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's a lot of extra comm chatter coming out of that station. Not sure what all the commotion is about, but we can't wait to find out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542782" id2="17" version="1065353216">Find the station, take out the leadership, then maybe we can go back to pushing the Imperials off this rock.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542784" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm busy. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542785" id2="17" version="1065353216">We may not get another opportunity like this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542789" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did it--and then some. With their leaders dead and their supplies destroyed, the Esh-kha are in a bad way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542791" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're pulling back now. Should give us time to catch our breath. Thanks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542792" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're vulnerable. Now's the time to keep the pressure on them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542792" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't let up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542793" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sending a few squads out to retake some of our more defensible outposts. Not much, but it's a start.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542795" id2="17" version="1065353216">What else can you tell me about these Esh-kha?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542795" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where do they come from?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542796" id2="17" version="1065353216">Piece of cake.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542797" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wasn't just a fluke, I can see that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542800" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were true to your word--the Esh-kha leaders are down and their grunts are scrambling to reorganize.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542803" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did it. Once the Esh-kha realized their supplies were being wiped out, they turned tail, just like we hoped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542805" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hit those Esh-kha with everything you've got.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542806" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agh... chest... hurts....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542808" id2="17" version="1065353216">Try not to breathe, son. Rib's broken, almost punctured your lung. Gonna try and move it....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542810" id2="17" version="1065353216">General Skylast! We've lost the bridge! Enemy's smashed through, heading right for us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542812" id2="17" version="1065353216">Knew we couldn't hold them long. Tell everyone to fall back. We'll make our stand here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542814" id2="17" version="1065353216">We finally meet. The Esh-kha are making their final push off this rock... just a massacre away from clinching their freedom.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542815" id2="17" version="1065353216">Their onslaught stops here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542815" id2="17" version="1065353216">That won't happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542816" id2="17" version="1065353216">It better. We've got nowhere else to run.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542818" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha will bring only mayhem and death to the galaxy. They mustn't escape.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542818" id2="17" version="1065353216">That would be catastrophic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542819" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't know that we'll have much say in the matter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542821" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've seen how these Esh-kha operate. I beat them once, I'll do it again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542821" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know how to win.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542822" id2="17" version="1065353216">And here I just finished scraping those last few Esh-kha off my boot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542822" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here we go again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542823" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was quite a licking you gave them last time. Hope you've got another in you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542825" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is the Republic sending any more troops our way?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542825" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any reinforcements coming?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542826" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hard to recruit soldiers for a war nobody knows about. Took every bit of clout I had just to get this many here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542828" id2="17" version="1065353216">So?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542829" id2="17" version="1065353216">You fought them before. We need your experience.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542831" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha have already overrun all our defensive outposts. This is our last shot at stopping them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542835" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome to the fight for Belsavis, Master Jedi. You're just in time to be torn apart by a horde of escaped warmongers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542836" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome to the new front line, Major. Better check your gear. Got a battalion of crazed warmongers on their way here now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542837" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome to the front lines, Captain. Hope you're looking for a fight. Pretty soon, we'll be up to our elbows in kill-crazy warmongers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542838" id2="17" version="1065353216">Might want to think about turning back. Got an army of escaped warmongers on the way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542839" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force brought me here for a reason. Perhaps I can stem this tide.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542839" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe I should help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542840" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hope so. Running low on ammo--and men.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542842" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose negotiating with them is out of the question.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542842" id2="17" version="1065353216">No diplomacy, then?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, not gonna happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542845" id2="17" version="1065353216">Havoc Squad's faced down superior forces before, sir. I'm with you until the end.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542845" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not afraid.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542846" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad to hear it, soldier. Could use the extra blaster.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542848" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not going anywhere; not while your men still have credits to their name. Pazaak, anyone?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542848" id2="17" version="1065353216">Live a little, while you can.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542849" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe when we're done here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542851" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll need to be more specific. What are we dealing with here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542851" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who's coming?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542852" id2="17" version="1065353216">You coward.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542853" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fear keeps a soldier from running willy-nilly into blaster fire. It saves lives.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542855" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperials got careless, opened something they shouldn't have. Unleashed an entire army on us--some species we've never seen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542857" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're called &quot;Esh-kha.&quot; Remnants of a galaxy-spanning civilization predating the Republic. Couldn't play nice and got sentenced here. Permanently.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542858" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not all Esh-kha are violent; some tried to facilitate a peaceful coexistence with other species.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542858" id2="17" version="1065353216">They aren't all bad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542859" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you say so. Have yet to meet one who wasn't trying to take my head off.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542861" id2="17" version="1065353216">Things were bad enough when we only had riots to deal with. Now we've got a whole army on the loose?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542861" id2="17" version="1065353216">It just keeps getting worse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542862" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least they're not taking sides. Imperials have been getting hit as hard as we have.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542864" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Republic didn't lock them up, then who did?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542864" id2="17" version="1065353216">How'd they get here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542865" id2="17" version="1065353216">A species even older than the Esh-kha. Had the right notion, keeping them here--too bad it didn't take.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542867" id2="17" version="1065353216">Didn't seem to do much for their temperament. They still don't play nice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542867" id2="17" version="1065353216">They haven't changed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542868" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd think a few thousand years in stasis would've cooled them off a bit. No such luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542870" id2="17" version="1065353216">These Esh-kha are relentless. Been hammering us nonstop. Won't be long before they overrun us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542872" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need a diversion--something to put them on the defensive and stall their momentum. That's where you come in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542873" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take the fight to them? Risky, but it just might work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542873" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's worth a try.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542874" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha's victories will have made them overconfident. We may yet catch them by surprise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542874" id2="17" version="1065353216">They won't be expecting it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542875" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a long shot, but it's all we've got.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542877" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just give me a chance to get behind their lines. You'll get your diversion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542877" id2="17" version="1065353216">Count me in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542878" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's also where my compensation comes in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542878" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's talk payment first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542879" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do your part, you'll get your credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542881" id2="17" version="1065353216">A diversion will slow them down, but it won't stop them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542881" id2="17" version="1065353216">That'll only delay them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542882" id2="17" version="1065353216">This diversion could be the game-changing act we need to turn the tide of this battle.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542884" id2="17" version="1065353216">Uh-oh.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542885" id2="17" version="1065353216">What I'm proposing is dangerous, but it beats waiting for the Esh-kha to wipe us out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542887" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've pinpointed two potential targets: a supply depot and an outpost housing some of the Esh-kha's key leaders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542889" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hitting either of those ought to draw their warriors back and allow us to retake some ground.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542890" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Esh-kha will be nothing without a chain of command.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542890" id2="17" version="1065353216">The leaders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542891" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're holed up in an outpost right now, probably planning something horrible for us. Kill every last one of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542893" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're still welcome to go after the supply depot. Dangerous, but every bit helps.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542895" id2="17" version="1065353216">Taking out that depot ought to slow down the Esh-kha.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="542895" id2="17" version="1065353216">The supply depot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542896" id2="17" version="1065353216">The depot is packed with munitions and medical supplies. Destroy it all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542898" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're also welcome to take a crack at those lieutenants. Risky, but every bit helps.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542900" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll see if I can get some more answers about these Esh-kha while you're out. Good hunting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="542902" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got incoming hostiles. Lots.</text>
		<text bitflag="336" id1="771224" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not my priority, but...</text>
