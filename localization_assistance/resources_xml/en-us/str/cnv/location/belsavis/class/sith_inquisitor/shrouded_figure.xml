		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503223" id2="17" version="1065353216">We got your signal loud and clear, Sith. This thing's insane. There're measures in dimensions we didn't know existed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503225" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's like those Rakata freaks were taking existing species and picking and choosing useful parts. Modular life-form adaptation. You can't make this stuff up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503227" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your Darth wasn't after medicine. He was after mutation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503228" id2="17" version="1065353216">What kind of mutation?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Interesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503229" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can't say. This device doesn't have data on Force-sensitive species. There must be another one of these around somewhere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503231" id2="17" version="1065353216">Darth Iratus was trying to control his power. You can't manipulate Force sensitivity biologically.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503231" id2="17" version="1065353216">How does that work?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503232" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who knows what the Rakata were capable of.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503234" id2="17" version="1065353216">The things I do for power.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503234" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503235" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm trying the best I can, but there aren't words for half the stuff I'm seeing.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503237" id2="17" version="1065353216">Boss. This thing's sending some kind of signal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503239" id2="17" version="1065353216">Grokan. Jack me a satellite and trace it. Let's follow this boy home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503241" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hutt's warts. This thing's huge. Like some kind of Rakata superhub. And it's still running! This has to be the thing you're looking for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503242" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then let's move.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503243" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're wrong about this, I'll come kill you personally.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503243" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd better be right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503244" id2="17" version="1065353216">What else could it be? Your diagrams confirm it. What you're holding is a piece of the whole, and this thing is the whole.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503246" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you mean it's running? What is it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503246" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's running?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503247" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ancient alien supercomputer. But don't let its age fool you. It's larger than anything modern and a million times as powerful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503249" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lemme see... looks like, blast. Quarantine zone. The air in that place is deadly. Hold on, we'll try to get you a security override.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503251" id2="17" version="1065353216">But be careful. If that crazy alien machine thing's running, someone had to start it up.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503253" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's this? Another Sith in search of the heart of Belsavis? Turn back. You have been warned. I am watching.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503254" id2="17" version="1065353216">People who try to intimidate me have an appalling mortality rate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503254" id2="17" version="1065353216">Empty threats.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503255" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who exactly is watching?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503255" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who are you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503256" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're the Sith that came here before me, aren't you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503256" id2="17" version="1065353216">Darth Iratus?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503257" id2="17" version="1065353216">Say no more. You have been warned.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503261" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lemme see... looks like, blast. Quarantine zone. The air in that place is deadly. Guards in the area should have breathing masks. Wouldn't go in without one.</text>
