		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540812" id2="17" version="1065353216">You may want to hurry. The Scourge is getting more recruits every day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540814" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need to find a way into cell block 923-A.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540815" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I went and told Jarvey he was seeing things. The captain wouldn't be here, I says. Not after besting Nok Drayen.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540817" id2="17" version="1065353216">But here you are!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540819" id2="17" version="1065353216">Name's Amikab. If you just got nicked, you came to the right Bith. I can get you to block 923... for a price.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540820" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me what you know, and I'll pay what it's worth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540820" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll give you credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540823" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just to show I know you're a notch above the scum in here, I won't even haggle.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540825" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm on the guards' side this time. What kind of perks are you looking for?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540825" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can help you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540828" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only one thing anyone's looking for--the way off. You get me that, I'll get you the back door to every half-credit gang hideout on Belsavis.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540830" id2="17" version="1065353216">Talk or I blow your brains all over this yard.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540830" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me or else!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540833" id2="17" version="1065353216">All right. Back down, killer.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540835" id2="17" version="1065353216">But don't think that attitude will work everywhere. Lots of folks here would be happy to let you grant their death wish.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540839" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Scourge is the gang that took block 923, puffed-up sons of Hutts. They've rerouted the cells' generators to shield themselves. Call the place their &quot;fortress.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540840" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me you've got their spare key, and I'll really be impressed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540840" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do I get in?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540841" id2="17" version="1065353216">Strictly information. Keeps my skin whole.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540843" id2="17" version="1065353216">What kind of surprises can I expect if we go head-to-head?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about the Scourge.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540844" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're just like every pack of fools who think an open door and some scavenged blasters make them the next Mandalore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540846" id2="17" version="1065353216">You talking about on- or off-site?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540846" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where are the generators?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540847" id2="17" version="1065353216">The generators are off-site. If you shut them down, you should be able to shoot your way in through the rest.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540849" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll give you the spot, then we're done here.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540850" id2="17" version="1065353216">I knew you were more brains than brawn. That's it exactly.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540852" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want in without making friends, first you've got to shut down their generators.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540854" id2="17" version="1065353216">There should be men guarding them, but nothing like what you'll be facing once you get inside.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540855" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now we're talking. Where do I find the generators?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540855" id2="17" version="1065353216">Point me at them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540856" id2="17" version="1065353216">Appreciate it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="540857" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anything else about this place I should know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="540857" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me more about Belsavis.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540858" id2="17" version="1065353216">They say the Voidwolf's behind the strike; he's looking to build us into an army. Me, I think he couldn't give a kretch's backside what happens to us.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540860" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me see your datapad--I'll give you the generator site. They don't give us access to anything with transmission capability.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540862" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once you get in, look for the stockpile. The Scourge stash their weapons up front. You reach 'em before they do, and you're set.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540864" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now let's see the credits. I'm worth my price.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540865" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now keep in mind who helped you. Anything else you need, I'm the man in the know.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="540867" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anything you need to know, I got it.</text>
