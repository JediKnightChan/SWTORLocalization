		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485709" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've arrived at the Belsavis spaceport.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485710" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good. We'll have to work quickly if we're to find a cure for your strange ailment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485712" id2="17" version="1065353216">We know that a Sith called Darth Iratus suffered a similar problem. His power became too much for him and he began to deteriorate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485714" id2="17" version="1065353216">We also know that he went to Belsavis in search of a Rakata device that he believed could &quot;fix&quot; him. Whatever that means.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485715" id2="17" version="1065353216">You haven't learned anything new about the device, then.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485715" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't know much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485716" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nothing beyond the diagrams Iratus himself left. I'm afraid technology isn't my area of expertise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485718" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who were these Rakata?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485718" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rakata?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485719" id2="17" version="1065353216">Little is known of them. They were highly advanced, and ruled the galaxy. Then they just disappeared.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485721" id2="17" version="1065353216">Great. So let's get to the surface.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485721" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blah blah. Let's go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485722" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't advise that. Not without a plan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485724" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've looked into Belsavis; there is indeed evidence that the Rakata were here and that they built some kind of monumental prison.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485726" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Ryen said something about a Republic prison. I'd never heard of these Rakata.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485728" id2="17" version="1065353216">Indeed. The Republic built their own prison on top of the Rakata one. Whatever this device is, we'll have to navigate two prisons to get to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485729" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Rakata on Belsavis! My friend, you trade in myths and wonders. Myths and wonders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485731" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic have arrived since, however, and built their own prison. Whatever this device is, we'll have to navigate two prisons to get to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485732" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have to find the device first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485732" id2="17" version="1065353216">One step at a time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485733" id2="17" version="1065353216">That could pose an interesting challenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485735" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll destroy that prison piece by piece if I have to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485735" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever it takes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485736" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fortunately, that work has already begun.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485738" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do we know this device hasn't been destroyed?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485738" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is it still there?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485739" id2="17" version="1065353216">Iratus's research is solid. I've checked it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485741" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire recently discovered the Republic's prison and staged a massive prison break.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485743" id2="17" version="1065353216">Saves us the trouble of breaking in, I guess.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485745" id2="17" version="1065353216">It also means the planet is in chaos, and any trail Darth Iratus left will have been obliterated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485746" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we don't have Darth Iratus to follow, we need to take another approach. Do you know any Rakata experts?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485746" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's try a different approach.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485747" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no such thing as a Rakata expert. Little is known of them and even less of it makes sense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485749" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't need Darth Iratus's trail. Give me the information and I'll find the device.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485749" id2="17" version="1065353216">If he could find it, I can.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485750" id2="17" version="1065353216">Without a trail to follow or any field experts in ancient alien technology? You're good, but I don't know if you're that good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485752" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wonder what the Empire wants with Belsavis. It seems rather out of the way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485752" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire? Interesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485753" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm afraid I've been out of the loop too long to say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485755" id2="17" version="1065353216">But while perusing the Republic prison logs, I discovered a familiar name: the Circle. A group of criminal technologist Nikto I once employed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485757" id2="17" version="1065353216">They never met a system they couldn't slice or a machine they couldn't reverse-engineer. Perhaps they can interpret Darth Iratus's diagrams on Belsavis.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485758" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I will speak to them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485758" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a plan, then.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485759" id2="17" version="1065353216">A good start.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485761" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you know where they were being held?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485761" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where can I find them?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485762" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unfortunately, no.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485764" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope you're right about this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="485764" id2="17" version="1065353216">This better work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485765" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Circle sliced into an ancient computer system that had the Empire's best paleotechnologists stumped. You won't find anyone better, on Belsavis or anywhere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485767" id2="17" version="1065353216">I bet one of the guard houses has a record of where they were kept. I've seen my share of prisons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="485769" id2="17" version="1065353216">We must be careful. Belsavis is a place of unknown danger. But be quick. The dates on Darth Iratus's records show his condition worsening rapidly.</text>
