		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509017" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're too late. The detonite charges are in place. Even you won't be able to stop them all in time!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509020" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're too late. My teams are already placing the detonite charges. You'll never stop them all!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509021" id2="17" version="1065353216">The power of the light side is stronger than you think. You'd know that if you could feel the Force.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509021" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force is with me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509022" id2="17" version="1065353216">All your tricks and distractions can't stop me, Krannus. I'm ending this!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509022" id2="17" version="1065353216">You underestimated my power.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509023" id2="17" version="1065353216">You surprise me. I thought for certain you would stop to help Doctor Gantrell.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509024" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's nowhere left to run. I'm putting an end to your madness.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509024" id2="17" version="1065353216">I finally caught you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509025" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't give you time to complete the Emperor's mission. You're finished, Krannus.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509025" id2="17" version="1065353216">Many other lives were at risk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509026" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've tried everything to keep me from catching you, but it didn't work. You're done, Krannus.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509026" id2="17" version="1065353216">Enough of your tricks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509027" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're all going to die here. The difference is, I'll live again.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509031" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperials! Surrender to this Jedi Knight immediately! Drop your weapons!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509033" id2="17" version="1065353216">Republic special forces. Sorry to show up late.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509034" id2="17" version="1065353216">Better late than never.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509034" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad you could make it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509036" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's over, Krannus. Don't be a fool. Surrender.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509037" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought my mission was top secret. Where did you come from?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509037" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did you know about me?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509038" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll explain after this scum surrenders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509040" id2="17" version="1065353216">The enemy is on a suicide mission. Take them out!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509040" id2="17" version="1065353216">Open fire on the Imperials!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509041" id2="17" version="1065353216">For the Emperor's glory! Die and be reborn!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509044" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've already gained access to the maximum security wing. Impressive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509046" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't expect my men to kill you, but I was hoping they'd slow you down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509047" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not going to stop, Krannus. Sooner or later, I'll catch you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509047" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can't run forever.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509048" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're never going to reach the Rakata power core, Krannus.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509048" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know about your plan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509049" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your pathetic followers never stood a chance. Neither will you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509049" id2="17" version="1065353216">They were weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509050" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force is a powerful ally, but I have my own resources--and more than one plan to destroy this world.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509052" id2="17" version="1065353216">My commandos are planting explosives along the volcanic rift. The detonation will trigger cataclysmic eruptions. Geysers of molten lava will kill millions--including you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509053" id2="17" version="1065353216">This distraction might buy you time, but you're still going to fail.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509053" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll stop them... and you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509054" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509056" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why would you tell me this and give me a chance to prevent it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509056" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is some kind of trick.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509057" id2="17" version="1065353216">I intend to give the Emperor a much greater gift than the lives on Belsavis. Destroying the volcanic rifts is merely insurance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509058" id2="17" version="1065353216">All these little traps are spreading your forces too thin. You won't have anyone left when I finally catch up with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509058" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're getting desperate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509059" id2="17" version="1065353216">If all goes as planned, that meeting will never happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509060" id2="17" version="1065353216">So this is just a distraction.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509061" id2="17" version="1065353216">One you cannot afford to ignore. Not unless you want the Emperor to win.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509063" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're going to stop my commandos, I suggest you hurry. I'll press on without you. I'm sure you understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509066" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's get this up and running again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509069" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for slaying Colonel Hareth. Her death at your hand has surely marked her as one of the chosen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509071" id2="17" version="1065353216">She will receive a place of honor when the Emperor grants us eternal life.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509072" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor will never complete his ritual. Not as long as I'm alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509072" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not going to win.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509073" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've been brainwashed. The Emperor has filled your head with false promises so you'll throw your lives away for him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509073" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor lied to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509074" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's not coming back to life. That doesn't happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509074" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dead is dead. End of story.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509075" id2="17" version="1065353216">I may not feel the Force as you do, Jedi, but I know its power transcends death.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509077" id2="17" version="1065353216">The spirits of ancient Sith linger in their tombs. Dead Jedi Masters guide their former Padawans. I've heard the tales. I know the truth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509079" id2="17" version="1065353216">This delay has cost you. Now, you cannot stop what is to come. The Emperor's will is inevitable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509082" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pak, come in. Executor Krannus isn't here. He's already gone deeper into the prison.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509083" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe we can track him using the prison surveillance systems. Let me see what I can cook up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509085" id2="17" version="1065353216">Republic reinforcements are finally on their way to secure that generator.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509087" id2="17" version="1065353216">Head back to my position. I'll start searching for Krannus.</text>
