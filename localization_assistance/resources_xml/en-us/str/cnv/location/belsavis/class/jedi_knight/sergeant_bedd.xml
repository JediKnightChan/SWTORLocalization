		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509338" id2="17" version="1065353216">Colonel Bartaph is waiting for you back at the main Republic base.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509341" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whew--that was cutting it close. We didn't know you were here until Master Satele informed Colonel Bartaph.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509342" id2="17" version="1065353216">Colonel Bartaph?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509343" id2="17" version="1065353216">The officer in charge of Belsavis. She's brought a battalion of soldiers to regain control of the prison.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509345" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now that the power core is secure, the colonel wants to meet with you about a Zabrak named Pak Taldine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509346" id2="17" version="1065353216">With Krannus out of the way, I think I can spare a few moments.</text>

		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509347" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's this about?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509348" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just know she wants to speak in person. Must be important.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="509350" id2="17" version="1065353216">It would be easier if she just contacted me on my holo.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="509350" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell her to call me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509351" id2="17" version="1065353216">I get the feeling it's important. She likes to handle those things face-to-face.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="509353" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll stay and guard the power core. The colonel is waiting for you at the main Republic base.</text>
