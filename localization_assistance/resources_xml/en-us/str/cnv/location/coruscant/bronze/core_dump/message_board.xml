We've got berserk maintenance droids. Sabotage? If anyone well-armed wants to help investigate, I would be extremely grateful.

If you can take the droids apart, drop their memory cores off in the Lower City. I'll collect the cores later, and make sure your account is credited. Thanks--Chief Maintenance Officer Harro</text>

Maintenance droids are malfunctioning in this area. They're designed to haul heavy pipe work, they can break a man in half.</text>
