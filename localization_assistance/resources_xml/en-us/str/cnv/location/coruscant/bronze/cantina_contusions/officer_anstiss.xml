		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689921" id2="17" version="1065353216">Medic's on the way. One more beating from Gambo would have finished me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689922" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't know what you said, but I almost died of shock when Gambo turned himself in.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689924" id2="17" version="1065353216">Command might grumble about excessive force, but it's not my fault he picked a fight with someone he couldn't beat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689926" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're not taking any chances. There's a whole squad escorting him back to headquarters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689928" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should call a medic before I pass out. Thanks for the help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689930" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gambo's a threat we can't tolerate. He's got to be stopped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689933" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wait. I'm too dizzy to get a head count, but I know you outnumber me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689935" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's an honor, Master Jedi. I apologize in advance if I throw up on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689937" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stop there, uh, officer? I can't make out your rank, but I think you can help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689939" id2="17" version="1065353216">Halt, citizen. I'm seeing double, but you both look like you can handle yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689941" id2="17" version="1065353216">Officer Anstiss. Nice to... ouch... meet you. Apparently I've got enemies back at HQ.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689943" id2="17" version="1065353216">Got the unenviable task of arresting Gambo--Black Sun enforcer with a string of murders to his name.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689945" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've gone inside the Dealer's Den half a dozen times to confront him, and he's beaten me within a centimeter of my life each time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689946" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe I should talk to Gambo.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689946" id2="17" version="1065353216">He'd listen to a Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689947" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Jedi might at least make him think twice, if that's a serious offer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689949" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps you should try talking to Gambo instead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689949" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't have to fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689950" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gambo doesn't talk, except with his fists.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689952" id2="17" version="1065353216">If an attack fails, you don't keep using it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689952" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need some strategy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689953" id2="17" version="1065353216">Strategy for security officers is pretty much limited to shock sticks and neural bands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689955" id2="17" version="1065353216">He can't beat blaster fire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689955" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be more direct.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689956" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic doesn't kill its criminals, even if they're asking for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689958" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't look so good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689959" id2="17" version="1065353216">My head's pounding and you're covered in spots. I've been better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689961" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your problem, not mine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689962" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gambo's vicious, and he's been terrorizing this sector for months. As long as he's at-large, the public's not safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689964" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd call for backup, but frankly, Gambo could tear through that whole cantina if he had a mind to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689966" id2="17" version="1065353216">He needs to be talked down or knocked out if I'm going to arrest him. I'm no match, but you might have a shot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689967" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll go talk to Gambo. You should get to a medcenter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689967" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry about it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689968" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't leave my post. I can't take Gambo, but I can keep tabs on him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689970" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like a challenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689971" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one sees Gambo without going through Zooki, his lookout.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689973" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're lucky, Gambo might give you a few words before he starts swinging. Use them wisely.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="689975" id2="17" version="1065353216">Toughen up. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689976" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right then, guess I'm going back in. As soon as the room stops spinning.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689978" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry, can't help you. I'm out of commission until I can see straight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="689982" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gambo's passed out inside. You should arrest him before he wakes up.</text>
