		<text bitflag="1360" id1="121361" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sometimes good people die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="121386" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just tell me what you want.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446395" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey! Hold up a minute. I need to talk to you before you go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446396" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know what you and Asara did down in engineering. How could you just kill all of those people?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446397" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't know that! You can't have possibly known that!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446398" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's it? That's all you can say for yourself?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446399" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nobody wanted this to happen. But we had to get the bridge open, or else everyone would've died.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446399" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446400" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we survive this at all, it will be because of me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446400" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't question me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446401" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're the only reason anyone on this ship is still breathing, Haken.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446401" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't question us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446402" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been flying with Salen for ten years, do you understand?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446403" id2="17" version="1065353216">Seems you and Asara will sacrifice anyone and anything. Well, if you ask me, there's only one sacrifice that needs to be made to keep this ship safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446404" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just talked to Salen from engineering. He told me what Asara tried to make you do down there. Thank you for stopping her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446405" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was just doing what she thought she had to do to save the ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446405" id2="17" version="1065353216">Asara had good intentions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446406" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sacrificing innocent people is wrong, no matter the reason.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446406" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just did what seemed right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446407" id2="17" version="1065353216">And she would've killed a lot of good people if you hadn't stopped her. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446408" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't believe that woman is an ambassador. She's as cold as they come.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446408" id2="17" version="1065353216">Asara had to be stopped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446409" id2="17" version="1065353216">You stood up for the lives of my crew, and risked your own instead. I won't forget that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446410" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad I'm not the only one who's noticed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446411" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you suggesting, Haken?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446411" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446412" id2="17" version="1065353216">Listen, I've been thinking. I really believe this plan is going to work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446413" id2="17" version="1065353216">But there's only one way to guarantee that we all make it home safe. And that's to make sure the Imperials have no reason to keep chasing us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446414" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want me to hand the ambassador over to the Imperials, don't you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446414" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is about Asara, isn't it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446415" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes. For the sake of us all, I want you to leave Asara behind on the Grand Moff's ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446416" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want you to leave Asara on the Grand Moff's ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446417" id2="17" version="1065353216">With the tractor beam down, we'll be able to escape. But Kilran will just chase us down again--unless he's already captured his target.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446418" id2="17" version="1065353216">Asara is the reason for all of this. If you're serious about doing whatever it takes to save this ship, then you'll make sure she doesn't come back with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446419" id2="17" version="1065353216">You may be right about this, Haken.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446419" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll consider it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446420" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know I'm right. And I'll be sure you get a suitable reward if you side with me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446421" id2="17" version="1065353216">As long as Asara is on this ship, everyone aboard is in danger. I don't know about you, but I'm tired of risking all of our lives for that woman.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446422" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't sacrifice the engineers to get us out of this. I won't sacrifice Asara, either.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446422" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't leave her to die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446423" id2="17" version="1065353216">My judgement isn't clouded. This is what has to be done, I'm sure of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446424" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not interested in high ideals, Jedi. I'm interested in getting people home safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446425" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't let your anger at the ambassador cloud your judgment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446425" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't go down that path.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446426" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ambassador Asara is a Republic official. It's our duty to protect her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446426" id2="17" version="1065353216">What you suggest is treason.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446427" id2="17" version="1065353216">Freedom is meaningless if it's bought with treachery.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446427" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can't become our enemies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446428" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this really what's best for the ship? Or are you just looking for a bit of payback?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446428" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're just angry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446429" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe. Doesn't change the fact that leaving her behind will save the rest of us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446430" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just think about it. I'd even make it worth your while if things go the way I'm suggesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446431" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's going to be dangerous over there. If Asara didn't make it, nobody would even think twice about it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446432" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leaving Asara behind ensures the safety of everyone else on the ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="446432" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't agree more.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446433" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyway, you'd better get going--I've held you up too long already. Good luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="446434" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad we're on the same page, here. And I'm going to make sure you get rewarded for your help in this.</text>
