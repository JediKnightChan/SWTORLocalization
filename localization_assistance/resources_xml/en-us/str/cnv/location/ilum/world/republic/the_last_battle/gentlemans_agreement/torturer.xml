		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477226" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know you're working with someone inside the Empire. Give me the traitor's name!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry... I'm not too good with names. I remember faces. Maybe if you show me some holograms....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477230" id2="17" version="1065353216">Aaaaah!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477232" id2="17" version="1065353216">There are nine levels of pain we can inflict. That was level three. Remember it before your next answer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477233" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're dealing with the supreme commander of the Republic. You want him to talk, you better crank it all the way up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477233" id2="17" version="1065353216">You call that interrogation?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477234" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please... don't give him any ideas.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477236" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, the Republic's secret weapon. I know you were responsible for Lord Loyat's death. For that, you must pay!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477237" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only a sick, sadistic monster could torment a helpless prisoner. Don't you see what Darth Arho has turned you into?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477237" id2="17" version="1065353216">The dark side has twisted you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477238" id2="17" version="1065353216">Spoken like a dutiful servant of the Jedi Council. You will never defeat us. You lack the stomach to do what is necessary to win!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477240" id2="17" version="1065353216">But where was your mercy when you faced my apprentice? Lord Loyat is dead, and for that, you must pay!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477241" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's see if you have the guts to stand up to someone who can fight back!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477241" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torture is a tool of cowards!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477242" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, the hypocritical code of the Jedi Knight. You condemn our tactics, yet you took the life of my apprentice. And for that, you must suffer!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477243" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lord Loyat wasn't a helpless prisoner. She had a chance to fight back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477243" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was a fair fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477244" id2="17" version="1065353216">And now so do you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477246" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll deal with this scum, Commander.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477246" id2="17" version="1065353216">Havoc Squad is here, sir!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477247" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not a moment too soon, Major.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477249" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, the noble leader of Havoc Squad. The blood of my apprentice is on your hands. You will pay for Loyat's death!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477250" id2="17" version="1065353216">Step away from Supreme Commander Rans. Now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477250" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leave him alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477251" id2="17" version="1065353216">You killed Lord Loyat! You will pay dearly for taking my apprentice from me!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477252" id2="17" version="1065353216">You abandoned her when she called on you for help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477252" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't care about her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477253" id2="17" version="1065353216">She had to prove herself. She knew the price of failure. Now you will learn the price of defying me!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477255" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have Loyat in custody. She surrendered after you abandoned her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477255" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's not dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477256" id2="17" version="1065353216">No! She would never surrender! She would give her life for me! For your lie, my Minions of Pain will punish you with an agonizing death!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477258" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your apprentice was no match for me. And neither are these pathetic underlings.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477258" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477259" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's easy to make threats when you're not even here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477259" id2="17" version="1065353216">Brave talk for a hologram.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477260" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unlike the Republic, the Empire sees no value in risking our best and brightest to the front lines. That is left to servants and followers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477262" id2="17" version="1065353216">My Minions of Pain are well-trained in the arts of agony. You will suffer an excruciating death!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477264" id2="17" version="1065353216">This ends now!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="477264" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll pay for that. [Attack]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477265" id2="17" version="1065353216">Destroy them! Let Loyat's defeat be avenged by their screams of torment!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477266" id2="17" version="1065353216">Destroy him! Let Loyat's defeat be avenged by his screams of torment!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="477267" id2="17" version="1065353216">Destroy her! Let Loyat's defeat be avenged by her screams of torment!</text>
