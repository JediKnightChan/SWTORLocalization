		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628143" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our eyes are watching. Our ears are hearing. Always.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628146" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, have you found it then, the communication device, which the spy Alma called an heirloom?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628147" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take the heirloom.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628147" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here you go.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628148" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good, good. Here is the small pay which we can give you from the Republic in gratitude of your aid catching this spy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628149" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shouldn't you go arrest her?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628149" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go take Alma into custody.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628150" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess I'll be living cheap this year. Great.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628150" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't overdo it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628151" id2="17" version="1065353216">We are sorry that there is no more to pay, but the Republic's funds run tight as the Empire encroaches.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628153" id2="17" version="1065353216">All in the service of the Republic!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628153" id2="17" version="1065353216">For the rightful government!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628154" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe so. Maybe you only did it because of your duty. But if we all do our duty, then there will be no more need of fighting or of spies.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628156" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now we must analyze the communication device, which is called an heirloom, and set our trap for the spy who is called a Republic citizen.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628158" id2="17" version="1065353216">It will take time, but we will arrest her and learn much about her contacts, too. It is a great service you have done. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628162" id2="17" version="1065353216">No problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628163" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's my job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628164" id2="17" version="1065353216">I prefer my thanks in credit form.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628164" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pay me more next time.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628165" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you and good luck. We will bring her in soon. We promise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628167" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be, uh, getting it soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628167" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Lie] No, not yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628168" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, well, seek it out with both eyes and bring it to us. Quickly!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628170" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must find the communication device, which is called a necklace, and bring it to us. The scavengers have taken it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628171" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, who is this poking around in the house of eyes? Strange coincidence that we are all here now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628174" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628175" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why is it a coincidence?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628175" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you mean?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628176" id2="17" version="1065353216">Explain yourself or prepare to fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628176" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm losing patience here.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628177" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no need for fighting.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628179" id2="17" version="1065353216">We think maybe you are looking for the same thing as us, and so you have come to the same place. It is not surprising that she should send someone.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628181" id2="17" version="1065353216">She sent you here for her necklace, yes? That confirms our suspicions. It is a good thing that you have come, yes, to confirm our suspicions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628182" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't come to confirm anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628182" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not why I'm here.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628183" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did not come for that purpose, but that is what you have done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628185" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are we talking about the same necklace here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628185" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm confused.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628186" id2="17" version="1065353216">The same necklace, but different stories, we suspect. She is a crafty one--crafty and tricky. But you were not fooled, we think.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628188" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're mistaken.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628189" id2="17" version="1065353216">You talk of knowledge, but I wonder what it is you know and what it is she told you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628191" id2="17" version="1065353216">She has called it a family heirloom, yes. We have heard it being called that with both ears. But it is much more than a necklace.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628193" id2="17" version="1065353216">This woman you have met, this woman called Alma is a spy, yes. We have been keeping both eyes on her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628194" id2="17" version="1065353216">What does this have to do with the necklace?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628194" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about the heirloom?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628195" id2="17" version="1065353216">And you're sure because?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628196" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me what's going on here!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628196" id2="17" version="1065353216">Explain this to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628197" id2="17" version="1065353216">We are with the Republic. We are the ones who watch spies. But she watches for the others--for the Empire. They have both eyes on Ord Mantell--her eyes.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628199" id2="17" version="1065353216">Her heirloom is a communicator that looks like a necklace. A necklace that works like a communication device. She uses it to speak to the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628201" id2="17" version="1065353216">Either way, it is the proof we need to arrest her with both hands. Do you understand now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628202" id2="17" version="1065353216">If she's an Imperial spy, we can't let her get away with it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628202" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have to stop her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628203" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care who she talks to--she's paying me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628203" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doesn't matter to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628204" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can pay you too, though perhaps not so much. You must decide your loyalty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628206" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you want me to help?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628207" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm totally lost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628207" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not at all.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628208" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then we will explain again. The woman whose heirloom you seek is an enemy, and the heirloom is the tool she uses to betray us. We must stop her.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628210" id2="17" version="1065353216">The necklace is the first thing. We must find it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628212" id2="17" version="1065353216">The scavengers have beaten us to this place and taken it. We must steal it back to stop the spying woman. This is something you can do, yes?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628213" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can't delay.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628214" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then we are in accord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628216" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where are these scavengers?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628216" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do I find them?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628217" id2="17" version="1065353216">We will mark the location of the scavengers on your map. There you will find the communication device, which is called an heirloom.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="628219" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can do it. I don't know if I will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="628219" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628220" id2="17" version="1065353216">We do not like that you would help a traitor to the Republic, but we can do nothing against you until you act. Such is our paralysis.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628222" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you are wishing to help, though, we will mark the scavengers' location on your map. There you will find the communication device, which is called an heirloom.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628224" id2="17" version="1065353216">We will compensate you on your return.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="628226" id2="17" version="1065353216">We watch. We listen. Always.</text>
