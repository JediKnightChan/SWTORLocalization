		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546746" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everyone's got to do their part.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546747" id2="17" version="1065353216">What, is taking that ring to the old man too complicated for you? Get moving!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546748" id2="17" version="1065353216">Haven't you caused enough trouble here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546749" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come on, get her in here on the double. We don't have all day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546751" id2="17" version="1065353216">I already told you! I don't know anything--I swear!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546753" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sure, that's what you said the last time we talked. But now I'm thinking maybe you just didn't have enough incentive to tell the truth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546755" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey! What are you doing here? You're not allowed in here! This is a top secret operation!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546756" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's all this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546757" id2="17" version="1065353216">None of your business, buddy. Move along.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546759" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was looking for a kidnapped girl. I won't intrude again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546759" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546760" id2="17" version="1065353216">Top secret, eh? Illegal, more like.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546760" id2="17" version="1065353216">This doesn't look legitimate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546761" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should talk, scum, considering the sort of things your kind does. We serve the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546763" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's lying! They've kidnapped us. They're torturing us!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546765" id2="17" version="1065353216">You soldiers didn't happen to attack a merchant, did you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546765" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm investigating a beating.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546766" id2="17" version="1065353216">My father sent you, didn't he? Thank you!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546768" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shut up!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546770" id2="17" version="1065353216">Aaaaah! Please, you have to stop them! They're torturing us!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546772" id2="17" version="1065353216">I said shut up! She's a traitor to the Republic. She deserves what she gets.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546774" id2="17" version="1065353216">But the courts are full, you see, and so justice needs a little help. If that means Republic soldiers have to twist a few arms, so be it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546775" id2="17" version="1065353216">You seem awfully certain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546776" id2="17" version="1065353216">We do whatever we can to protect the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546776" id2="17" version="1065353216">I agree.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546777" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's what I like to hear. You want to help us help the Republic? Here's what you do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546779" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look, I was hired to bring back this man's daughter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546779" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546780" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, you look. I don't care who hired you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546782" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's ridiculous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546783" id2="17" version="1065353216">Torture is a legitimate tool of warfare. Do you think the separatists won't use it? Do you think the Empire won't use it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546785" id2="17" version="1065353216">These wretches have been caught, every last one of them, doing work for the separatists. They are traitors, and more importantly, they have information on separatist movements.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546787" id2="17" version="1065353216">All we're doing is coaxing it out of them--information that will save so many Republic and Mantellian lives. Who'll care how we got it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546788" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll care, and I'll make sure your superior cares, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546788" id2="17" version="1065353216">Me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546789" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bribe me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546790" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sure, I think we can spare some credits, but you have to do us a favor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546792" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic has more respect for its enemies than that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546792" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're better than this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546793" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look, we don't like having to do this--but what are our choices? Listen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546795" id2="17" version="1065353216">You take this ring back to this girl's daddy and tell him it's all you can find of his little girl. The ring's got a listening device in it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546797" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll be able to gather all the evidence we need--without resorting to these unsavory means. Got it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546798" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll return to the merchant and plant the bug.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546798" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546799" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good, I'm glad you see things our way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546801" id2="17" version="1065353216">How could you? This is why the separatists endure. You're cruel and corrupt and selfish!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546803" id2="17" version="1065353216">How many times do I have to tell you to shut up, woman!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546805" id2="17" version="1065353216">Urgh.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546807" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pay no attention to her. And here, take some of the credits we found on these traitors--as a sign of our continued friendship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546808" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't want your dirty money.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546808" id2="17" version="1065353216">Save it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546809" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't call it dirty. I'd call it... a fair reward for risking our lives in service to the Republic. But suit yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546811" id2="17" version="1065353216">Money is good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546812" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just remember to do your part.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546814" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just don't try me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546815" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, yeah. Just stay out of our way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546817" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go ahead and take the girl back to her cell, boys. I think we've got a much better lead, now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546819" id2="17" version="1065353216">This charade of justice ends now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546819" id2="17" version="1065353216">Absolutely not.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546820" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whoa, whoa, take it easy! The last thing we need in here is a shoot-out, all right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546822" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want the little traitor so bad, fine--take her. But the only people you're helping are the separatists.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546824" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. It--it was terrible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546825" id2="17" version="1065353216">How could I not?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546826" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you really with the separatists?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546826" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me the truth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546827" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, no, we went to a couple of protests, attended a few meetings, but we never did anything. We certainly don't know anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546829" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, sure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546831" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's the truth! We had no idea speaking our minds would get us marked as traitors!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546832" id2="17" version="1065353216">What they did was shameful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546833" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad you see things my way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546835" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe you should keep your mouth shut from now on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546835" id2="17" version="1065353216">Watch what you say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546836" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't do that. Change won't happen if people don't speak out. But I will be more careful--I promise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546838" id2="17" version="1065353216">Best go home to your father--and try to stay out of trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546838" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's over now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546839" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your father will want to see you're alright.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546839" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go home to Odar.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546840" id2="17" version="1065353216">Um, yes. I'll, uh, I'll call him by holo... let him know I'm okay, that you saved me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546842" id2="17" version="1065353216">It seems like it's nothing but corruption on Ord Mantell these days. Good to see you're an exception.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pleased to serve.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546844" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I'm just glad you were here. Thank you so much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546845" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be careful from now on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546846" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry. I'll be careful. Thanks again, and goodbye.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546847" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your father's waiting. He's badly injured, and very worried about you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546847" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd better go home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546848" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know, I'm sorry. It's all my fault those soldiers beat him up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546850" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll call him as soon as I can, but I need to recover my strength. The torture took more out of me than I expected.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546852" id2="17" version="1065353216">But thank you. I'd be dead without you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546854" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nothing to see here, soldier. Go about your business.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546855" id2="17" version="1065353216">This area is off-limits to civilians. That means you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546856" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nothing to see here, all right? Just keep moving.</text>
