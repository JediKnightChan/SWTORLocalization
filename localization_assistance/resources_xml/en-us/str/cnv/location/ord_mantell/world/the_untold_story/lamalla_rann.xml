		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546664" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure they'll send me another holorecording specialist soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546665" id2="17" version="1065353216">The holodiscs--you've got them! That's fantastic, amazing, unexpected even. I can't wait to see the footage from when the bodies were--wait. Where's Waxx?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546666" id2="17" version="1065353216">Turns out he joined the separatists.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546666" id2="17" version="1065353216">He joined the enemy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546667" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blast. And since he didn't come back with you, I'm guessing he didn't give up the holodiscs willingly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546669" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now it'll take a miracle to convince him to come home. Stupid kid--always sympathizing with the underdog a little too much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546671" id2="17" version="1065353216">The only thing I found was the holodiscs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546671" id2="17" version="1065353216">No idea.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546672" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure he'll turn up. Likely taken in by the romance of the movement and all that. He'll come toddling back when he gets bored.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546674" id2="17" version="1065353216">The separatists killed him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546674" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546675" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, poor kid. He was always getting caught up in the romance of different movements and societies. I guess it finally caught up with him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546677" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyway, fair's fair. Here are your credits. Spend them in good humor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546678" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take care.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546679" id2="17" version="1065353216">I really hope the recordings are worth it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546679" id2="17" version="1065353216">Make those discs count.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546680" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been fun.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546681" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right. It's footage like this that makes all the fighting and death worth it, you know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546683" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look, I see your face and I know what you're gonna say, so don't even bother.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546685" id2="17" version="1065353216">Waxx is with the separatists, right? Or he was adopted by a separatist family, or he's training in firearms, or some other blasted stupid thing. Am I right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546686" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's gone completely native.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546686" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546687" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did you know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546687" id2="17" version="1065353216">You knew?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546688" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's just that type of kid, isn't he? On Tatooine, he went to live with the Jawas for three months--thought they were his spiritual kin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546689" id2="17" version="1065353216">He wouldn't give me the holodiscs. Do I still get a reward?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546689" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd still like a reward.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546690" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, I suppose you deserve something. After all, we know Waxx is alive, and he's got the footage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546692" id2="17" version="1065353216">One day he'll realize that the separatists are just as immoral as everyone else. And hopefully by then, he'll have some fantastic footage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546694" id2="17" version="1065353216">In the meantime, I'll get a new holorecorder sent out here and gather what I can. Here's a little something for your time and effort.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546695" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546696" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take care.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546697" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're as crazy as Waxx is.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546697" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're nuts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546698" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you get yourself shot, I'll do a story on you!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546700" id2="17" version="1065353216">Waxx has got to be over there across the bridge--or at least the footage has to be....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546701" id2="17" version="1065353216">Listen, if you're here to tell me to clear out, then I'll tell you the same thing I told that uptight commander: Not going to happen. Got it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546703" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got as much right as you do to be here--in fact, I've got more. I'm a model of free speech, a paragon for posterity.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546705" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you? A local grunt, that's what. No good to anybody. So don't go telling me to clear out. I won't do it and that's that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546706" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not here to tell you to clear out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546706" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not why I'm here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546707" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nice try there, gunslinger. I know your type like I know the galaxy, which is like the back of my hand--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546708" id2="17" version="1065353216">Had some trouble with the local troops?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546708" id2="17" version="1065353216">You sound frustrated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546709" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you trying to smooth-talk me, gunslinger? Con me? You trying to play good soldier and--</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546710" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bad attitude.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546711" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not attitude--I'll show you attitude. You like that, don't you? Seeing spirited citizens stand up for themselves and--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546713" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh damn, you're not actually with the locals, are you? Sorry about that, my mouth always engages first. Brain's working now, though, and I got an idea.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546715" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need something done, and I don't have enough credits to bribe the whole corrupt Ord Mantell army. I've got enough to bribe a smaller army, though. You for hire?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546716" id2="17" version="1065353216">Depends.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546717" id2="17" version="1065353216">Think of it as an adventure. Wait--no, don't do that. You'll wander off aimlessly. Think of it as a job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546718" id2="17" version="1065353216">I could always use more credits.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546718" id2="17" version="1065353216">As long as you're paying.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546719" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fantastic, good to see someone with the complete lack of scruples needed to protect justice and freedom in the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546720" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't take bribes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546720" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not for sale.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546721" id2="17" version="1065353216">So don't call it a bribe, call it... a spurious outpouring of generosity for a job well-done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546722" id2="17" version="1065353216">A bit busy right now, actually.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546722" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546723" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then make yourself unbusy. Look, this is about bigger things than you and me and way more important than your schedule.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546725" id2="17" version="1065353216">My partner and I were in Mannett Point recording stories of the uprising when the separatists attacked, bombs everywhere, carnage like you wouldn't believe. Fabulous footage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546727" id2="17" version="1065353216">My partner got lost--good kid but not a lot upstairs, you know. He's still out on that island somewhere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546728" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll find your partner.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546728" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll go get him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546729" id2="17" version="1065353216">I take it the local troops weren't helpful?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546729" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one's offered help?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546730" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't make me laugh. The only time anything gets done on Ord Mantell is when there's a hefty bribe involved. That's why we're playing private contractor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546731" id2="17" version="1065353216">So it's a rescue mission?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546731" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want him back?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546732" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha! Sure, why not? I mean, he was a nice kid. I'm more worried about the holorecordings we took of the uprising, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546734" id2="17" version="1065353216">No promises.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546735" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care--just get it done. A girl who waits for other people to keep their promises is a girl who dies alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546737" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look, if you can find my partner and bring him back, great. His name is Waxx, and he's a self-important little holorecording specialist.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546739" id2="17" version="1065353216">If he's dead or whatever, I'll still pay you for the holodiscs if you can find them. Great footage on there, fantastic, gory stuff.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546740" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546741" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anything to support the arts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546741" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like a worthy cause.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546742" id2="17" version="1065353216">Goodbye, crazy woman.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="546742" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sure, whatever. Just get away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546743" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bring me those discs!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="546745" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not moving until I have the story of my career!</text>
