		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630538" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must be here for my husband. I told master Viidu he's gone out fishing. Would you like a sweet flatcake instead? It's fresh.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630539" id2="17" version="1065353216">This whole place is crawling with separatists. What's Trymbo doing out fishing?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="630539" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fishing in a war zone?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630540" id2="17" version="1065353216">Catching dinner, I hope. We're making Aqualish medley!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630542" id2="17" version="1065353216">Eh, I could eat. You got any bantha milk to wash it down with?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="630542" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, I am hungry....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630543" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course! Help yourself, dearie.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630545" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't need your husband--just those fancy chemicals he makes. Where does he keep them?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="630545" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just give me the chemicals.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630546" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, he took his work with him. My butternut gets bored unless he has a dozen things to occupy him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630548" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you don't feel like waiting for Trymbo, the walk out to him is lovely. The beach is so relaxing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630550" id2="17" version="1065353216">Trymbo's at his fishing camp. He'll be thrilled to have some company. Now excuse me, dearie--these Rodian peppers won't cook themselves!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="630552" id2="17" version="1065353216">Goodness! I wasn't expecting guests. Give me a few moments, dearie, and I'll whip up some sweet flatcakes!</text>
