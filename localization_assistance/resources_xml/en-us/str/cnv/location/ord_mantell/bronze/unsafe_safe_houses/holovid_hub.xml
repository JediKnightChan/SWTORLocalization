Military intelligence has recently learned the location of several separatist safe houses. These facilities are hubs for the illegal transfer of military secrets and must be neutralized.

The Ord Mantell Authority will compensate freelancers who are able to successfully shut down these safe houses.  
Thank you for your continued cooperation with Ord Mantell military operations.</text>
