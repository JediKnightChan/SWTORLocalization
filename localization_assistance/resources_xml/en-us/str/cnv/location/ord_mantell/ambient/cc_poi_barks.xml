		<text bitflag="1345" id1="126981" id2="17" version="1065353216">Seps made their charge on this fort once--souped-up speeders, a few heavy arms. It didn't go well for them.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="126985" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't believe the seps were able to build this place. It must've taken years.</text>
