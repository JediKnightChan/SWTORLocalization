		<text bitflag="1345" id1="67249" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="67253" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260005" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have surprised me, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260007" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have the heart of a Sith. Had you been born on Korriban, you would be sitting on the Dark Council now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260009" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is too late to turn you fully from the light--but should your children have a connection to the Force, I will see them properly trained.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260010" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was that a compliment or a threat?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260010" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's creepy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260011" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did you take it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260013" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Force is strong in you. Too strong for the restrictions the Jedi impose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260015" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any children of mine will be Jedi!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260015" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't let you!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260016" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha. Were you true to Jedi teachings, your protest would be that you will never have children of your body.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260018" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you will turn against those shackles as you have so many others.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260020" id2="17" version="1065353216">Had you been instructed in the true way of the Force, the galaxy could not match your power. I will make sure that mistake does not happen again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260021" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Sith Lord of my blood... it's an intriguing thought.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260021" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260022" id2="17" version="1065353216">He would have power such as the galaxy has never seen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260024" id2="17" version="1065353216">It would be my greatest honor to train him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260032" id2="17" version="1065353216">I now understand why your Council tries to control your pleasure as well as your anger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260034" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pleasure is a far more powerful motivator.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260035" id2="17" version="1065353216">What makes pleasure more dangerous than other emotions?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260035" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why do you say that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260036" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pleasure is the foundation of all desires. There is nothing that inspires so much anger as thwarted longing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260038" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi have no need for comfort or amusement. We're beyond self-indulgence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260038" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pleasure is for the weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260039" id2="17" version="1065353216">All beings crave what they do not have. Do not pretend you are different.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260041" id2="17" version="1065353216">What good is having power if you can't enjoy how it feels?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260041" id2="17" version="1065353216">It makes life worth living.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260042" id2="17" version="1065353216">Power is only one life's pleasures.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260044" id2="17" version="1065353216">I still remember the feel of sunlight on my skin. The scent of favorite foods. The color of my first love's eyes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260046" id2="17" version="1065353216">To experience those simple pleasures again would be worth anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260047" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is why Jedi don't form attachments. Desire unbalances you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260047" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're dangerous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260048" id2="17" version="1065353216">You misunderstand everything. My equilibrium never deviates. I feel... nothing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260050" id2="17" version="1065353216">See? You haven't lost your humanity, after all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260050" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's hope for you, yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260051" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do not mock me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260053" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor took all that away from you. Don't fool yourself into believing you can get it back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260053" id2="17" version="1065353216">Give up on that dream.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260054" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least I have the satisfaction of knowing he paid for what he took from me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260056" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps, but there is satisfaction in having revenge. The Emperor will pay for what he took from me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260058" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand why your Council controls you. What I'll never comprehend is why you let them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260064" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor was the only constant in my three hundred years of life. It is hard to grasp his death.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260066" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have sought the Emperor's death for so long, yet I cannot picture the galaxy without him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260068" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I was born, the Emperor was the Empire. Everything existed to feed his whims.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260070" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was so far above us. No one, Sith or slave, would have dared even form an opinion about him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260071" id2="17" version="1065353216">You served him personally. What is he like?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260071" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260072" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd say joining Revan to kill him counts as an opinion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260072" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260073" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I began serving him, I thought it was far simpler than that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260075" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is in the nature of the dark side to crave worship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260075" id2="17" version="1065353216">He made himself a god.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260076" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is more than the dark side. I thought that when I first served him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260078" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor was just a man, isolated by unimaginable power and the inability to trust the scheming sycophants who served him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260080" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was wrong. He was a plague. And I am the only one in the galaxy who understands the full service you did us by destroying him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260081" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where does that leave you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260081" id2="17" version="1065353216">What will you do now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260082" id2="17" version="1065353216">I do not know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260084" id2="17" version="1065353216">I tried to reach him, but there was no light left inside.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260084" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was beyond salvation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260085" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is not a matter of light versus dark.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260087" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're welcome. Now why are we still talking?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260087" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260088" id2="17" version="1065353216">Because I am caught between him and what I once was.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260090" id2="17" version="1065353216">The immortality he gave me, it has a terrible price. Taste, smell, touch, color, emotion--I have felt none of these for three hundred years.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260092" id2="17" version="1065353216">I do not wish to become as the Emperor and lose all tie to what once made me a man.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260093" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was wrong. He is a disease that must be stopped before it ravages us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260094" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will stop him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260094" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm working on it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260095" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then heed me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260097" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even the Emperor can be turned back to the light.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260097" id2="17" version="1065353216">There is still a man inside.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260098" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have heard nothing! He is not a man. He will not break down in tears of regret for what he's done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260100" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you going somewhere with this? Because I'm already planning to kill him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260100" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this just a pep talk?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260101" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only to warn you that the Emperor is not just a man. He changed long ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260103" id2="17" version="1065353216">Immortality comes at a terrible price. Taste, smell, touch, color, emotion--the Emperor and I experience none of these things.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260105" id2="17" version="1065353216">We are no longer mortal. When you face the Emperor, do not forget that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260106" id2="17" version="1065353216">And now he's worm food.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260106" id2="17" version="1065353216">He doesn't matter now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260107" id2="17" version="1065353216">He lived more than a thousand years. Even to me, that is almost unthinkable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260109" id2="17" version="1065353216">The cost of immortality is high. To live this long, I have sacrificed all ability to feel. Touch, taste, smell, color, emotion. I have not experienced these in centuries.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260111" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is no wonder the Emperor lost all ties to other beings.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260117" id2="17" version="1065353216">It has been... enlightening to spend so much time among you and your Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260119" id2="17" version="1065353216">For three hundred years, I have spoken to no one but Sith. And they do not change.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260121" id2="17" version="1065353216">They are the same on Korriban now as in my childhood. The same tricks, the same fights, the same groveling and mind control.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260122" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was that almost a compliment?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260122" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you've learned from us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260123" id2="17" version="1065353216">What reward would they get if they moved out of lockstep? A stab in the back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260123" id2="17" version="1065353216">They are scared to try.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260124" id2="17" version="1065353216">Most likely. Sith traditions are powerful... but very specific. Sometimes it takes an outsider to open our eyes to new facets of the Force.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260126" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't like it when you get nostalgic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260126" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you talking about?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260127" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am only surprised that I have learned the most of the Force from a Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260129" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan taught me to be effective when I became the Emperor's Wrath.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260131" id2="17" version="1065353216">And now I have learned as much from you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260132" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have opened my eyes, as well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260132" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I from you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260133" id2="17" version="1065353216">And here I thought you weren't listening....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260134" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your people have always underestimated the strength of the light side of the Force.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260134" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is the power of the light.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260135" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have nothing to learn from the light side!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260137" id2="17" version="1065353216">There may be powers you Jedi have mastered, but they do not require that I weep and beat my brow and hide behind the Council's skirts to achieve them!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260139" id2="17" version="1065353216">No more than what I learned from Revan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260140" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know what you did to your last teacher.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260140" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was that a threat?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260141" id2="17" version="1065353216">Indeed you do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260143" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is always a dangerous time, no, when the pupil begins to exceed the master?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260150" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor is dead at your hand, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260152" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yet you do not follow up on your victory. Any Sith would have seized the throne by now!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260154" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even Revan and the Jedi Exile would have been hard-pressed to resist so tempting a target.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260155" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who are you talking about?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260155" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260156" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is astonishing what you accomplish with so little knowledge. Revan caused your Jedi Civil War, centuries ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260158" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was even a Dark Lord for a time, but turned back to the light. The Jedi Exile was his protege, and partner in his quest to kill the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260160" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think I could... take the Emperor's place?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260160" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take the throne?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260161" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps I should not have sown such thoughts. They will be difficult to weed out now, no? Even for the scion of the Jedi?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260163" id2="17" version="1065353216">You remind me of Revan. He always had more darkness in him than the Jedi Exile.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260165" id2="17" version="1065353216">I do not know how more to prepare you to face the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260167" id2="17" version="1065353216">What has your training been?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260169" id2="17" version="1065353216">All I know of Jedi ways is from Revan. Surely they have changed in three hundred years.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260170" id2="17" version="1065353216">How does someone become the Emperor's Wrath?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260170" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd rather hear about you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260171" id2="17" version="1065353216">There has only ever been one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260173" id2="17" version="1065353216">My training as a Sith was not far different than Korriban today.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260175" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am prepared. I need nothing more from you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260175" id2="17" version="1065353216">My training is sufficient.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260176" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do not lack for confidence, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260178" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan and the Exile were much like you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260180" id2="17" version="1065353216">They truly believed that they could destroy the Dark Lord. I believed them, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260181" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not as much as you'd think.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260181" id2="17" version="1065353216">They haven't changed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260182" id2="17" version="1065353216">That is the great failing of both our peoples. We do not change.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260184" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I step onto Korriban, I'm always surprised to see the same training I saw three centuries ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260186" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only my visions set me apart, made them bring me before the Emperor. In his presence, I first saw who he was and what he planned.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260187" id2="17" version="1065353216">You still chose to serve him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260187" id2="17" version="1065353216">What did you do?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260188" id2="17" version="1065353216">I chose to live. Long enough to find one who could defeat him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260190" id2="17" version="1065353216">It must have taken great will to conceal such thoughts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260190" id2="17" version="1065353216">He didn't notice?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260191" id2="17" version="1065353216">Showing anything but submission would have been my death.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260193" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should have cut his throat, saved us all a lot of trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260193" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would have killed him then.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260194" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would have been rent to pieces before my hand touched the hilt of my lightsaber.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260196" id2="17" version="1065353216">I alone could not defeat him, so I chose to wait for one who could.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260198" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought Revan and the Jedi Exile were my chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260199" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan and the Jedi Exile are legends. What were they like?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260199" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260200" id2="17" version="1065353216">It should not have surprised anyone that Revan turned Sith. He knew you cannot fight the dark side without understanding it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260202" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Exile was harder to read. Even with all she had done, she never trusted herself. With Revan, she was his student again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260204" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was three hundred years ago. Obviously, it didn't work out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260204" id2="17" version="1065353216">What happened?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260205" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hoped it would.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260207" id2="17" version="1065353216">I met Revan. He says you turned against him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260207" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you betrayed them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260208" id2="17" version="1065353216">I turned to them. As my only hope of defeating the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260210" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was their eyes and ears in the Sith Academy. Their most trusted ally.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260212" id2="17" version="1065353216">I liked them. I would have served them, but my vision told me they would fail. I cut down the Exile and brought Revan to the Emperor as a gift.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260213" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is that what you're planning to do to me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260213" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I should trust you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260214" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have killed the Emperor. You were all that I saw in my vision.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260216" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you are not the one who will stop the Emperor's madness, then I will await the one who will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260218" id2="17" version="1065353216">You regret betraying them. There is room in the Force to forgive even such heinous crimes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260218" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can still be redeemed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260219" id2="17" version="1065353216">I do not seek forgiveness.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260221" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is that when he made you his executioner?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260221" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess he liked it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260222" id2="17" version="1065353216">The only way to live long enough to find the Jedi who would kill the Emperor--to find you--was to convince him to trust me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260224" id2="17" version="1065353216">He took my offering and gave me a place at his side. He gave me immortality.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260226" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a gift. But not without its price....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260227" id2="17" version="1065353216">What does any of this matter?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260227" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is ancient history.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260228" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps it does not.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260230" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you have lived centuries, you see that everything is a pattern that grows out of itself. Sometimes you can no longer see the trees, only the roots.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260232" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is the smallest part of the price of immortality.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260238" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your people speaking of the Empire sound like a distorted echo.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260240" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I was born, we thought the rest of the galaxy to be mystery and legend.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260242" id2="17" version="1065353216">We had been alone for a thousand years.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260243" id2="17" version="1065353216">What was it like? I can't even imagine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260243" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about that time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260244" id2="17" version="1065353216">We were what you made us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260246" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we had known, the Jedi would not have let the Emperor hold you like that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260246" id2="17" version="1065353216">We should have helped you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260247" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi! Do you think we waited for rescue? The Jedi destroyed us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260249" id2="17" version="1065353216">In my youth, Jedi were how you threatened errant children. &quot;Obey your masters or the Jedi will obliterate you.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260251" id2="17" version="1065353216">For thousands of years, we had total control of a hundred star systems. Then the Jedi drove us to the farthest fringe of the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260252" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor had subjugated thousands of species. Every non-Force user was enslaved!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260252" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a reign of terror.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260253" id2="17" version="1065353216">They were safe and served to their own capability.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260255" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was generations ago. Do people really still care?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260255" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sore subject?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260256" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did your people still care to fear us when we re-emerged?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260258" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're in Republic space now. That's skirting dangerous ground, talking like that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260258" id2="17" version="1065353216">Drop the propaganda.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260259" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is hardly worth debating. I gain nothing from understanding how your Republic's fools view the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260261" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am surprised that once your Council finishes its brainwashing, any Jedi has a spine left to oppose the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260263" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps you are young enough to still cultivate the strength of the Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260264" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you came here to turn me to the dark side, you'll be disappointed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260264" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will never be Sith!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260265" id2="17" version="1065353216">I came to defeat the Emperor, and we have done that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260267" id2="17" version="1065353216">I came to defeat the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260269" id2="17" version="1065353216">Turning you to the dark side is purely for my own amusement.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260270" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan, the Exile and I were all Jedi-trained. We all resisted the Emperor. What Sith have done so?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260270" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi have our own strength.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260271" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was... a surprise. In three centuries, I expected to see one test his strength against the Dark Lord....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260273" id2="17" version="1065353216">But those strong enough to challenge him are killed young, or co-opted into the Dark Council.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260275" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps you are right. Jedi strengths are different... not necessarily lesser.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260276" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm open to Sith tricks. What have you got?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260276" id2="17" version="1065353216">What can you teach me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260277" id2="17" version="1065353216">The dark side is no trick, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260279" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you release the control the Jedi Council has drilled into you, when you feel anger in your every connection to the Force....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260281" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you accept that a woman must use any means necessary to prove her strength....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260283" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you can accept that a man of authority must use any means necessary to achieve his ends....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260285" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then you will have discovered the dark side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260286" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're here to be useful. Not to chat.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260286" id2="17" version="1065353216">Spare me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260287" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am impressed the Jedi allowed you to graduate their ranks with such a... pragmatic outlook.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260289" id2="17" version="1065353216">Most would be busy trying to sell me their vision of the light side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260291" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad you realize I'm not buying.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260297" id2="17" version="1065353216">I did not think you would speak to me willingly, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260299" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now that our... alliance of convenience is no longer necessary.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260300" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will you abandon me, then?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260300" id2="17" version="1065353216">What will you do now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260301" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we are to remain allies, Jedi, what is your cause?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260303" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right now, the jackals of the Empire snap at each other over the corpse you left them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260305" id2="17" version="1065353216">Has your time among Jedi opened your eyes, Sith?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260305" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was hoping you've changed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260306" id2="17" version="1065353216">Has your time with me removed your Jedi blinders?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260308" id2="17" version="1065353216">Consider your path, Jedi, before you dismiss mine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260310" id2="17" version="1065353216">Alliance nothing! You work for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260310" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're mine, Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260311" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just as I would have said it, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260313" id2="17" version="1065353216">But if I am to work for you, you must strive towards something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260315" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps together, we can fill the void on the Emperor's throne....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260316" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thank you for your trust, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260318" id2="17" version="1065353216">I might not have given mine so freely were our positions reversed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260319" id2="17" version="1065353216">The light is always waiting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260319" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is the Jedi way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260320" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not here for your Jedi sermons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260322" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll hear you out, but nothing more.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260322" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't trust you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260323" id2="17" version="1065353216">We work well together. In time, you will believe me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260325" id2="17" version="1065353216">Until the Emperor's death, we are allies. Not friends.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260325" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need you... for now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260326" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260328" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand you do not trust me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260330" id2="17" version="1065353216">But were the Emperor to find me here, he would subject me to a thousand years of torture.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260332" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have no need of this collar to control me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260333" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me more about this vision. What makes someone like you bow to me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260333" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why are you here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260334" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine. The collar can come off. But I'm not letting you out of my sight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260334" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will remove it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260335" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260337" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who wouldn't want the Emperor's Wrath on a chain?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260337" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like it on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260338" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps there is less difference between Jedi and Sith than I was taught.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260340" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will speak of my vision in detail to your Council. Suffice it to say, I have long opposed my lord Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260342" id2="17" version="1065353216">As I told your Council, the Emperor's plan is not to rule the galaxy, but to consume it. I've devoted centuries to stopping him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260344" id2="17" version="1065353216">For a time, I worked with the greatest of your Jedi heroes--Revan and the Jedi Exile. But they did not have the strength to complete their task.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260345" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan? Jedi Exile? Should I know what you're talking about?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260345" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260346" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan was both Jedi Master and Sith Lord. His student, the Exile, defeated the Sith triumvirate. They were your greatest heroes. I hoped to help them kill my lord Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260348" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's quite a claim.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260348" id2="17" version="1065353216">You knew Revan?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260349" id2="17" version="1065353216">You will find no proof. I hid my association with them well. Nonetheless, I was their ally in the shadows, helping them oppose my lord Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260351" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're wandering. Talk about the vision.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget the history lesson.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260352" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revan and the Jedi Exile were some of the Republic's greatest heroes. I had hoped to work with them, to aid their quest to kill my lord Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260354" id2="17" version="1065353216">Until my vision: Jedi, shining with the Force, lined up to destroy him. All were swept aside. Revan and the Exile were cast at my feet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260356" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then out of the shadows, one Jedi emerged to cut the Emperor down. That Jedi wore your face.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260357" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hadn't even been born yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260357" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wasn't this centuries ago?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260358" id2="17" version="1065353216">I waited three hundred years for your birth. When I saw your face on Quesh....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260360" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the hopes of so many rest with me, I will do my best to honor them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260360" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will do my best.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260361" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you succeed, there will truly be a void left to fill.</text>

		<text bitflag="1360" id1="260363" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260364" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is a vision, Jedi, not a battle plan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="260366" id2="17" version="1065353216">In the vision, I bowed to you and took a crown from the Emperor's head.</text>
