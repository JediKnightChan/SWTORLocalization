		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525512" id2="17" version="1065353216">C--Corso? Is that you? How did...? I didn't think I was ever... oh....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525514" id2="17" version="1065353216">I heard they took in strangers who were new to the planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525516" id2="17" version="1065353216">They locked me up and... were they going to eat me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525517" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a &quot;gift of flesh&quot; from the desert. They were meant to eat you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525517" id2="17" version="1065353216">Didn't you hear the man?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525518" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ooh. I think I'm gonna--blarf....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525520" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't tease him, Captain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525522" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're okay, Jet. But... how did you end up here? I thought Syreena got everyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525524" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're gone. They won't be hurting anyone again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525524" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're safe now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525525" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did you end up here, Jet? I thought Syreena got the whole crew.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525527" id2="17" version="1065353216">I had the sec cameras wired to my comm. I saw it all go down. Started running and didn't stop 'til I hit Tatooine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525529" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you'd stood up for yourself, you wouldn't have ended up on the menu.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525529" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should have fought back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525530" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jettison's a slicer, Captain, not a killer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525532" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was a slicer. Now I don't even have that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525534" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was trying to start over. After what Syreena did... I've been too scared to go into anyone's systems.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525536" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was kind of a game to me, working for Viidu. It never really hit home that we were committing crimes. That people could die....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525537" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, your peaceful village plan's a bust. What next?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525537" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you going to do now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525538" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... I don't know. I've got nowhere to turn.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525540" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's rough to lose friends like that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525540" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525541" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got no one. No place to go. No money. I was hoping I could take something from Viidu, but....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525543" id2="17" version="1065353216">You work for a man like Viidu, you're not in it for the retirement package.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525543" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's how crime works.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525544" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never thought about it. The HoloNet just always came easy to me, you know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525546" id2="17" version="1065353216">And now everyone I know is dead, and I'm in this forsaken wasteland, and....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525548" id2="17" version="1065353216">Corso, is there anything you...?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525550" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry, Jet. We'll take care of you. Won't we, Captain?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525551" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you want to do right by the kid, who am I to argue?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525551" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're the boss on this one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525552" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go to Anchorhead. Should be some people there who owe me and the captain a good turn.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525554" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll try to set you up with some legit work. I think you've had enough of the wild side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525556" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll say!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525558" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any valuables here are up for grabs. Take what you need, kid.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525558" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll help you start over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525559" id2="17" version="1065353216">The separatists are finished back on Ord, Jettison. The captain helped wipe 'em clean.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525561" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll make sure you've got enough to get a good start. Maybe find legitimate security work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525563" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, Corso. I can't think of anyone from the old crew I'd rather have find me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525565" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no one more loyal than Corso, Captain. You're lucky to have him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525566" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want my help, you've got to make it worthwhile.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="525566" id2="17" version="1065353216">Work for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525567" id2="17" version="1065353216">I told the captain, you're the best slicer I've seen. It'd be like working for Viidu again. But safer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525569" id2="17" version="1065353216">I got nowhere else. If you trust her, I'm not going to argue.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525571" id2="17" version="1065353216">I got no other options. If you trust him, so do I.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525573" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sign me up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525575" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll tell you where to go. We've got a kind of base, called Port Nowhere....</text>
