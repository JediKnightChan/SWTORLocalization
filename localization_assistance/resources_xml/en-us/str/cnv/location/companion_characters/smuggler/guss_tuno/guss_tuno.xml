		<text bitflag="1345" id1="504776" id2="17" version="1065353216">What? I didn't do nothing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="504777" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why are you always looking at me? Don't you trust me yet?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527605" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have I said &quot;thank you&quot; yet? If not, just remind me, and I will. Twice a day. Like atmospheric suppositories.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527607" id2="17" version="1065353216">I mean, most women aren't so forgive-and-forget....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527609" id2="17" version="1065353216">I mean, most guys, they'd have killed me without a second thought....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527611" id2="17" version="1065353216">I, ah, probably shouldn't keep reminding you not to trust me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527612" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm counting on you to be so helpful that I forget all about it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527612" id2="17" version="1065353216">Make me forget.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527613" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha! That's a good one. For a second there, I thought you were serious.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527615" id2="17" version="1065353216">Believe me, it's not something I'll forget.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527615" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't need a reminder.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527616" id2="17" version="1065353216">All right. All right. You don't need to spell it out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527618" id2="17" version="1065353216">By the way, can you tell that Corso guy to maybe see a doctor about his snoring? How does anyone sleep on this ship?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527620" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you going somewhere with this, or just blathering?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527620" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get to the point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527621" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just blathering. I do that a lot. Especially when I'm nervous. You might have noticed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527623" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this the whole ship? I thought it would be bigger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527625" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just, ah, tell me if you need anything, Captain. I'll be on the comlink, trying to order some decent food....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527626" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me everything you know about Rogun the Butcher.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527626" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's talk Rogun.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527627" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right to business, huh? He's a strange guy, Rogun, got his own kind of honor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527629" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think he gets off on the whole underworld anti-hero image.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527631" id2="17" version="1065353216">Freedom to thumb his nose at any authority on any planet. You'd like him... if he wasn't trying to kill you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527632" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not getting past that part.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527632" id2="17" version="1065353216">But he is trying to kill me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527633" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't get me wrong. They're not lying when they say he froze his heart in carbonite so it wouldn't get in his way....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527635" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just don't think you can play him with the usual tricks. He's smart and he's mean and he's good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527637" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's really gone deep cover? Didn't think the Empire gave their agents much freedom.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527637" id2="17" version="1065353216">Weird trait for an Imperial.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527638" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never tried to get under the covers with the guy, but if the gangster thing's just an act, he plays it really well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527640" id2="17" version="1065353216">When we land planetside, you get a room somewhere, right? You don't expect us to keep sleeping in these closets--? Never mind....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527641" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not looking to date the guy. Just tell me where he keeps his stashes!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527641" id2="17" version="1065353216">Give me something useful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527642" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I had anything good, I'd have ripped them off myself. But I'll give you what I know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527644" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is your nav computer? I thought you'd have something good!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527650" id2="17" version="1065353216">Captain, I just wanted to say &quot;thank you.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527652" id2="17" version="1065353216">I could never have imagined you would put up with me for this long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527654" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I first came on board with you, I thought it was going to be a few weeks at most before you left me on some isolated moon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527655" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep me laughing, and you've got a bunk on this ship forever.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527655" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a hoot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527656" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have you heard this one? &quot;There once was a Mon Cal from Dac. He wore a jetpack on his back....&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527658" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;He liked to shoot blasters, and fly even faster. He was a Mando-Cal attack.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527660" id2="17" version="1065353216">No? Well, I'll come up with a better one. You're like my family, Captain. No one else has ever given me the kind of trust and respect I've had here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527662" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once you're in my crew, you're family.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527662" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would never do that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527663" id2="17" version="1065353216">Aww, Captain... you'll make me cry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527665" id2="17" version="1065353216">Seriously, though. This is my family. More than the Jedi. More than the one I was born to. I've never been able to be myself anywhere like I have with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527667" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll never leave you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527668" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never say never.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527668" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still could happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527669" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know you better than that. Tough facade, but underneath, you're all heart.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527671" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've never been anywhere that I got the kind of trust and respect I have from you and the rest of the crew.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527673" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're like my family! I just know we'll all be together forever!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527679" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know, you're the kind of gal you know when she's mad. And you know when you've made her laugh.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527681" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're the kind of guy, you know where you stand. Either you're laughing or you're shooting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527683" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would have done much better with someone like you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527685" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Lorenn was just ice. You had no idea if he even knew you were in the room.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527686" id2="17" version="1065353216">The fart jokes are a dead giveaway.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527686" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're hard to miss.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527687" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, Master Lorenn hated those... if I'd been able to make him laugh, I wouldn't have had to be such a wretch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527689" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you know, you say &quot;hello,&quot; you get back, &quot;study more.&quot; Then you go release Kowakian monkey-lizards in the Masters' mess.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527691" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's just how it goes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527692" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I could, I'd teach you what to do with that lightsaber.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527692" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like you too, kid.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527693" id2="17" version="1065353216">Aw, Captain....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527695" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you were my Master, I might have practiced.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527697" id2="17" version="1065353216">Or at least not released the Kowakian monkey-lizards into your dressing room... maybe that was a bad plan....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527698" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you still moping about your old Jedi stuff?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527698" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get over him, already.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527699" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, sorry, should I be dancing to hear that the first guy who thought I was worth spit is locked up on some Sith prison ship?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527701" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll go work on the choreography!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527707" id2="17" version="1065353216">They should make every Jedi kid spend time in a war zone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527709" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you see what real Sith are like, it makes my blood run cold. And don't make any fish jokes there--I'm serious.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527711" id2="17" version="1065353216">It makes you see why the Jedi make such a big deal about not giving in to the dark side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527712" id2="17" version="1065353216">Isn't &quot;don't give in to the dark side&quot; kind of Jedi school 101?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527712" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're just realizing this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527713" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never thought I was the type. You know, like all Sith had to be these brooding, sadistic puppet masters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527715" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thinking about going back?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527715" id2="17" version="1065353216">It sounds like you miss it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527716" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am. But right now, I'm in your crew and I can't ask for anything better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527718" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't imagine you as a Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527718" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nobody is worried about you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527719" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's what I thought. You have to be a scheming, sadistic puppet-master, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527721" id2="17" version="1065353216">But Master Lorenn was right, the road to the dark side starts with things we all feel: jealousy, greed. They're all the seeds of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527723" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd rather spend the rest of my life meditating on a cold rock than turn into that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527729" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need you to teach me to fight dirty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527731" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd think I'd be good at that, you know? But when it gets beyond cowering in doorways, I'm pretty much all point-and-shoot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527733" id2="17" version="1065353216">Show me how you work your magic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527734" id2="17" version="1065353216">Set your blaster on stun. We'll take some time and see what you're made of.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527734" id2="17" version="1065353216">All right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527735" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stun. Huh. That's a good idea....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527736" id2="17" version="1065353216">I usually aim below the belt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527736" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just hit them where it hurts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527737" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hear that works really well on humans....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527738" id2="17" version="1065353216">No offense, but I'd rather see you as non-lethal as possible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527738" id2="17" version="1065353216">No.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527739" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine. I think I've learned a lot just from watching you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527745" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, have I been looking any more convincing with the lightsaber?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527747" id2="17" version="1065353216">I mean, it's about as much use to me in a fight as a glow-in-the-dark belt buckle, but I figure if I wave it around, maybe it'll scare people off.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527748" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think you can get me one of those?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527748" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nice!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527749" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll keep my eye out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527751" id2="17" version="1065353216">I haven't noticed anyone running in fear at the sight of you, no.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527751" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hasn't worked so far.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527752" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, you've got to admit, the people who attack us aren't generally very concerned about, well, living.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527754" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you can't use the lightsaber, you should return it to the Jedi, where it can do some good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527754" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should give it back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527755" id2="17" version="1065353216">Making me feel like an enormous glowing symbol of virility isn't good?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527757" id2="17" version="1065353216">This was the only lightsaber we had, you know, in the whole enclave. I wasn't in the Jedi Academy proper--never made it that far.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527759" id2="17" version="1065353216">My Master ran a recruitment center on Nar Shaddaa. I don't think he had the guts to actually bring me out in public.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527760" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doesn't sound like much of a life.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527760" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not a good memory?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527761" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a step up from prison.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527762" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought all Jedi trained at the Academy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527762" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Jedi recruitment center?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527763" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's always a few who slip through the cracks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527764" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unless you know something that will blast me to component atoms, make me a ton of credits, or both, keep your mouth shut.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527764" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't want to hear it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527765" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hear you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527767" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the best thing about you. You don't waste time with pointless conversations. If it's not important, it's just not on your radar. You....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527769" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shutting up now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527775" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess you've been wondering how someone like me ever ended up with the Jedi, huh?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527776" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't really seem like the Jedi type.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527776" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd thought about it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527777" id2="17" version="1065353216">They thought that, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527779" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's the duty of the Jedi to train anyone Force sensitive, so they don't fall to the dark side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527779" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Jedi take in everyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527780" id2="17" version="1065353216">Boy, you've picked up the party line....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527782" id2="17" version="1065353216">I really don't think about you that much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527782" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never considered it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527783" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was always kind of the odd one out in my family. And believe me, it was not a small family.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527785" id2="17" version="1065353216">When they kicked me out, I went to Nar Shaddaa... and met a Jedi who said all the weird stuff that happens to me is a connection to the Force.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527786" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't sell yourself short. You do plenty of weird stuff all on your own.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527786" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not all the weird stuff.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527787" id2="17" version="1065353216">And you know, that was an issue.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527789" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Jedi are all about recruiting kids too young to know better, so there it was, me and all these serene little kids.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527791" id2="17" version="1065353216">That must have been amazing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527791" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did that make you feel?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527792" id2="17" version="1065353216">At first. I was imagining myself winning lightsaber duels, getting revenge on all the kids who laughed at me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527794" id2="17" version="1065353216">But it turns out revenge isn't part of the Jedi lifestyle.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527796" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've never known real rage until you've been lectured on controlling your emotions by a four-year-old in a robe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527797" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said you were kicked out?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527797" id2="17" version="1065353216">What happened?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527798" id2="17" version="1065353216">I maybe overstated that. They don't really throw people out, you know. Call of the dark side and all that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527800" id2="17" version="1065353216">But it was clear I'd never make the cut. Anything I could do with the Force was basically random.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527802" id2="17" version="1065353216">Would it have been better not to know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527802" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you saying you regret it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527803" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, without my old Master, I'd still be picking pockets on Nar Shaddaa.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527805" id2="17" version="1065353216">But, yeah, sometimes those might-have-beens get a little bitter, you know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527807" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never even figured out how to work his old lightsaber....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527808" id2="17" version="1065353216">Avoid sanctimonious Jedi brats. Noted.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527808" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take your word for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527809" id2="17" version="1065353216">The kids were prigs, but at least they didn't pity me. The way my Master used to look at me....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527811" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't spend my life being the Jedi class clown, you know? It was obvious I wasn't going to master the Force.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527813" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never even figured out how to work my dead Master's lightsaber....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527814" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go tell your endearing anecdotes to someone who gives a womp rat's behind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527814" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527815" id2="17" version="1065353216">B--but... you're the best friend I've ever had.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527817" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was going to tell you about my life, and we'd go on a trip around the galaxy to fix my problems.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527819" id2="17" version="1065353216">And you'd give me gifts and I'd swear my undying loyalty and... it could still happen!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527825" id2="17" version="1065353216">So what was it like? Nok Drayen? I've been asking Risha, but she gets all weird and prickly about it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527827" id2="17" version="1065353216">She actually walked out when I said that it'd make a better story if you turned out to be Nok Drayen's long-lost daughter or something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527829" id2="17" version="1065353216">She actually slapped me when I said it'd be a better story if you turned out to be his long-lost son.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527831" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even Rogun was impressed when he heard you'd dug up the old man's treasures.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527832" id2="17" version="1065353216">What did Rogun say about me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527832" id2="17" version="1065353216">Talk about Rogun.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527833" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, it started with the blasters, but mostly he got mad after you dodged his assassins. It was a pride thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527835" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then when you hooked up with the lady Senator--hoooh, he hated her. He was after you just to get you out of her hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527837" id2="17" version="1065353216">But none of this is news. I want to hear about you!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527839" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't like to brag, but... oh, who am I kidding. I love to brag!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527839" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm very impressive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527840" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's why everyone's heard of you, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527842" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you trying to butter me up?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527842" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you want?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527843" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just want to know everything about you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527845" id2="17" version="1065353216">How does someone become the most famous spacer in the galaxy, anyway?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527847" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you always know this was what you wanted to do? I like to imagine your parents programmed janitorial droids, and this was your way out of the family business.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527848" id2="17" version="1065353216">I sort of fell into this lifestyle--not that I'm complaining. The money's good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527848" id2="17" version="1065353216">This wasn't planned.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527850" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can't ask for better, kid. Complete strangers give you credits to have the time of your life.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527850" id2="17" version="1065353216">I love being free.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527851" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wish my old Jedi Master could meet you. He'd have a harder time selling the whole &quot;deprivation is the key to happiness&quot; thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527852" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes. That's it exactly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="527852" id2="17" version="1065353216">Quit prying.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527853" id2="17" version="1065353216">Really? That's incredible. Did you mention something once? Otherwise I don't know how I would have....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527855" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh. Right. I'll stop asking.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527859" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can we talk, Captain? Somewhere private maybe? Like the ship?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527860" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you have a second? I promise it's something important. Well, to me, anyway...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="527861" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry, Captain. I got nothing for you... Unless you want to hear that story about juggling lightsabers in my underwear again...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="755708" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like my life... except for the good money part. Guess it's too late to discuss salary, huh?</text>
		<text bitflag="336" id1="767484" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fair point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988605" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm all yours now, Captain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988607" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need your own sail barge? I know a Hutt who's selling cheap....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988608" id2="17" version="1065353216">I--I think I'm gonna... blarg!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988610" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. No way. I'm not being bait. Not this time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988611" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hear you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988612" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll keep my eye out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988613" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll never leave you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988614" id2="17" version="1065353216">I could never have imagined you would put up with me for this long.</text>
