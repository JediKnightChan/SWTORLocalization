		<text bitflag="1345" id1="66391" id2="17" version="1065353216">Mm-hm.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="66395" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="504074" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have a most excellent partnership, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="504075" id2="17" version="1065353216">The galaxy is stranger and far more dangerous than I'd ever dreamed. It's wonderful!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699056" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just wanted to thank you again for having me along.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699058" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm honored to work with someone of your expertise. The archaeological pursuits of the Sith and Empire have been separate for too long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699060" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is our common history. We have a shared duty to unearth it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699061" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is strictly a business relationship. I want items of power, and you have the knowledge to find them for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699061" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't get too attached.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699062" id2="17" version="1065353216">The path to items of power is paved with pottery shards and broken carvings. But I'll try to spare you the boring bits.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699064" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't bring you along as part of some archaeological manifesto.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699064" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not why you're here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699065" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry, my lord. I have a tendency to get carried away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699067" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sith rarely seek knowledge for its own sake. Your purity is refreshing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699067" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think we'll get along.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699068" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't consider myself purer than anyone else in my line of work. I am honored to do what I do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699070" id2="17" version="1065353216">From the depths of the ground, history calls us to save it from obscurity. I do my best to answer that call.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699072" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can tell you do the same. You remind me of my old mentor, Auselio Gann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699073" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take that as a compliment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699073" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699074" id2="17" version="1065353216">I meant it as a compliment. He was the best there ever was.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699076" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you're saying I look like an old man?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699076" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's hardly flattering.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699077" id2="17" version="1065353216">Uh, no, my lord, I didn't mean--the resemblance is in spirit. I was referring to your love of knowledge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699079" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was the one who discovered... something about Naga Sadow's secret apprentice?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699079" id2="17" version="1065353216">You mentioned him before.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699080" id2="17" version="1065353216">Advanced archaeology a hundred years--no detail ever escaped him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699082" id2="17" version="1065353216">But what am I doing talking when there's work to be done. As we say in the service, the dead aren't getting any younger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699086" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord, I just wanted to thank you, again. The wonders I have seen working by your side are more than I could have ever hoped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699088" id2="17" version="1065353216">Truly, you are a paragon among Sith and the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699089" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for your kind words.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699089" id2="17" version="1065353216">How nice of you to say.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699090" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you angling for something here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699090" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you want?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699091" id2="17" version="1065353216">Only the honor of continuing to serve you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699093" id2="17" version="1065353216">I seek only knowledge. If it serves the Empire, then good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699093" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm just following my passion.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699094" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's precisely what I admire about you, my lord. Your love of knowledge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699096" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's gone out of practice, but there's evidence that certain non-Force users used to pledge themselves as loyal vassals to true Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699098" id2="17" version="1065353216">These vassals and their families were bound to the Sith and their family for generations. Will you accept my pledge to you and your heirs?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699099" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would be remiss to turn down such a heartfelt offer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699099" id2="17" version="1065353216">I accept.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699100" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't possibly ask that of you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699100" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're too kind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699101" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your humility is one of your most admirable traits, but this is not the place for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699103" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's an honor to serve you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699104" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't reject an offer of servitude, no matter how pathetic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699104" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can see profit in this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699105" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, I suppose to you it must seem pathetic. To me, it is a great honor. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699109" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord. I return, but Auselio Gann does not. He's dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699112" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doing his work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699115" id2="17" version="1065353216">My mentor was not weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699117" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was pursued by both Jedi and Sith. He managed to use the tomb's traps against them. But in the process, he imprisoned himself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699119" id2="17" version="1065353216">His discoveries are amazing. They will make a wonderful paper. But I can't help but wonder if it was worth dying for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699120" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you mean by that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699120" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699121" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, I don't know. I suppose you're right. It's silly of me to doubt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699123" id2="17" version="1065353216">Were there any artifacts of power in this tomb? If not, then no.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699123" id2="17" version="1065353216">That depends on my gains...</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699124" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose you're right. What's the point of going after old, dead things if they don't give you some advantage in the present?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699126" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, what am I saying? Auselio Gann would die if he were alive to hear that!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699128" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've given your life to reclaiming the Empire's past. Are you telling me it's not worth dying for?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699128" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't give up on me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699129" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know, you're right! How silly it was of me to doubt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699131" id2="17" version="1065353216">And to think, I was considering tendering my resignation. Oh what would Auselio Gann think if he could see me now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699133" id2="17" version="1065353216">I must continue his work. Thank you for restoring my faith, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699136" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know, I'm not sure I'd go that far....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699136" id2="17" version="1065353216">You give me too much credit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699137" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, my lord. No need to be modest.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699139" id2="17" version="1065353216">The historical mind is ever curious and never sated!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699143" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord! My lord! I've solved it. The chain in the medallion contained a holofrequency. I wanted you here when I called it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699144" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't waste any time, call.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699144" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699145" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why would your mentor hide a holofrequency in the chain? Why wouldn't he just tell you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699145" id2="17" version="1065353216">Very odd.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699146" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm confident Auselio Gann had his reasons.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699148" id2="17" version="1065353216">This isn't my problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699148" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not interested.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699149" id2="17" version="1065353216">It seems too good to be true. I must rely on your judgment that it's not a trick.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699151" id2="17" version="1065353216">Talos, my student. If you are receiving this message, then you have understood the riddle I gave you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699153" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've gone to the tomb of Vaius Antinus's unnamed apprentice, on Aduba Six. I don't understand why, but both Sith and Jedi are after this tomb and its secrets.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699155" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's the duty of the Imperial Reclamation Service to preserve this history. If I do not return, come find me, and finish my work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Auselio Gann is in trouble. He needs me. I must find him!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699158" id2="17" version="1065353216">You really care about him, don't you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699158" id2="17" version="1065353216">Such loyalty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699159" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose he was like a father to me. Not my father, but other people's fathers. Or an uncle. An older, smiling uncle. Who brings treats.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699161" id2="17" version="1065353216">This was an automated message. Who knows what has happened in the meantime?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699161" id2="17" version="1065353216">Assuming he's still alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699162" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know what could have happened. That won't stop me from going to Aduba-6.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699164" id2="17" version="1065353216">Find your mentor. Help him. Good luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699164" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699165" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can think of no more fitting place to die than a tomb, but I will do my best to return safely.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699173" id2="17" version="1065353216">Cruel nemesis, torment me no further! I surrender! I'm not worthy of finding Auselio Gann. He was depending on me, and I failed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699174" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't give up so easily. We can crack this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699174" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699175" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord, I would welcome your expertise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699177" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're an officer in the Imperial military. Pull yourself together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699177" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a mess.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699178" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, my lord. I apologize.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699180" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you telling me that the best archaeologist in the galaxy can't figure this out?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699180" id2="17" version="1065353216">How pathetic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699181" id2="17" version="1065353216">The best archaeologist? Well, I'm flattered, my lord, but I'm hardly--I mean, I wouldn't say that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699183" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've tried everything. I've even gone back to the medallion to see if my mentor left me any other clue.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699185" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Imperial Reclamation Service knew how many codes I violated trying to decipher this medallion, they'd have me stripped of my rank.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699186" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is it possible the solution is not on the medallion itself? Did your mentor give you anything else?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699186" id2="17" version="1065353216">Try a new approach.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699187" id2="17" version="1065353216">The only thing that came with the medallion was the chain, but it clearly wasn't part of the original.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699189" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's it! The chain was new when Auselio Gann gave it to me. That means he's the one who attached it in the first place! Thank you, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699190" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry. I won't report you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699190" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your secret's safe with me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699191" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, my lord. I suppose I will just have to let it rest. Perhaps when my mind is fresh, I can evaluate the situation from a new angle.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699193" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wait! Why didn't I see this before. The medallion came with a chain. It wasn't the original, so I thought it wasn't important. How wrong I was.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699194" id2="17" version="1065353216">Best of luck finding your mentor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699194" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're welcome.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699195" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699197" id2="17" version="1065353216">How could you overlook something so obvious?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699197" id2="17" version="1065353216">How pathetic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699198" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know. I'm ashamed. I would resign the service entirely if it wasn't imperative I find my mentor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699200" id2="17" version="1065353216">I often find when something's difficult it helps to approach it from another direction.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699200" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep an open mind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699201" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once again, my limitations are exposed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699203" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you'll excuse me, I must examine the chain more closely. I'm confident it's the key to finding him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699204" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't trouble me with this until you have a solution.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699204" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699205" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, my lord. I'm sorry. I'll let you know when I know something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699209" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord. I think we make an excellent team. Truly, destiny herself has conspired to bring us together!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699210" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your help has been extremely valuable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699210" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're welcome.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699211" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry, Talos, I like you, but I just don't think of you that way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699211" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you flirting with me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699212" id2="17" version="1065353216">No! No, that's not, I mean, I didn't mean it that way, of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699214" id2="17" version="1065353216">Great. So I'll never be rid of you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699214" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm stuck with you then.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699215" id2="17" version="1065353216">Um, yes, never mind then. I thought... I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699216" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was just joking with you. You're an important member of this team, and I value your support.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699216" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was sarcasm.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699217" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699219" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've learned so much at your side; my archaeologist's instincts are honed to a razor's edge. Or a pick's point, as the case may be.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699220" id2="17" version="1065353216">Watch your familiarity in the future.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699220" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't let it happen again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699221" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699223" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was just trying to express my gratitude. I'm a better archaeologist than I've ever been, thanks to your expertise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699225" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just leave me alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699225" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699226" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699229" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you have any luck finding your mentor?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699230" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, my lord. I'm afraid the trip was all for nothing. Auselio Gann was already gone, and nobody could tell me where.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699232" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was definitely in the tomb of Vaius Antinus--his workmanship was all over the site. But he left no clue that I could find.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699233" id2="17" version="1065353216">Next time you won't be in such a hurry to run off on a foolish errand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699233" id2="17" version="1065353216">So it was a waste of time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699234" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hm. Perhaps it was foolish to go chasing after such a tiny clue. Still, I won't stop looking.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699236" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry you couldn't find him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699236" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a shame.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699237" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure he'll turn up somewhere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699237" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't give up hope.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699238" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't you worry. I've not given up hope.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699240" id2="17" version="1065353216">Detective work such as this isn't much different from archaeology, after all. It's all about observation and deduction, and Auselio Gann taught me well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699242" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh! I almost forgot--I found this in the tomb of Vaius Antinus. I thought you might find it handy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699243" id2="17" version="1065353216">Um, I'm not sure what this is supposed to be.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699243" id2="17" version="1065353216">Great. What is it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699244" id2="17" version="1065353216">I do love presents.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699244" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hooray!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699245" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't need your trifles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699245" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't want it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699246" id2="17" version="1065353216">A trifle! My lord, I think you misunderstand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699248" id2="17" version="1065353216">Vaius Antinus was a meticulous record-keeper. These are the geneologies of all the great Sith Lords of his day. Look--here is your ancestor, Lord Kallig.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699250" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bloodlines are very important in the Empire, my lord. Not to mention the historical value!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699254" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord! I've solved it! I've figured it out!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699256" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't understand how I could've missed it. The outer layer of the medallion responds to heat! It melted away and revealed this!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699258" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a heat-resistant casing, with a data chip inside!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699259" id2="17" version="1065353216">Applying heat to an object like that--you could've destroyed it!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699259" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a dumb thing to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699260" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unofficial motto of the Imperial Reclamation Service: When all else fails, try a blowtorch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699262" id2="17" version="1065353216">Actually, that would be disastrous. I did a chemical sampling first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699264" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suspected the medallion was not uniform all the way through. I was right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699265" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why would your mentor bother sending you secret messages?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699265" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699266" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure there's a perfectly logical, not-remotely-scary explanation. I just haven't thought of it yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699268" id2="17" version="1065353216">What did you discover?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699268" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any new information?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699269" id2="17" version="1065353216">It certainly took you long enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699269" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're slow.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699270" id2="17" version="1065353216">We archaeologists can be a bit narrow-minded sometimes. I assumed that because the medallion was a fake, it wasn't important.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699272" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm beginning to believe your claims that your mentor was a genius.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699272" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fascinating.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699273" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was certainly one of a kind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699275" id2="17" version="1065353216">The chip said he was looking for the tomb of Vaius Antinus. He said he was going to Malachor Three, but everyone knows the tomb is on Alderaan!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699277" id2="17" version="1065353216">Remind me again why I care.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699277" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why are you telling me this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699278" id2="17" version="1065353216">Since you'd shown an interest so far, my lord, I thought you'd like to know how my search was going.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699280" id2="17" version="1065353216">I believe Auselio Gann went to Alderaan. I'm going to find him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699285" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord, remember I told you about my mentor, Auselio Gann? He took me under his wing after I discovered the domesticated rancor tooth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699287" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was polishing the rancor tooth and placing it among my things, when I noticed a medallion he gave me last time we met.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699289" id2="17" version="1065353216">I decided to call him, but none of his frequencies work anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699290" id2="17" version="1065353216">When was the last time you spoke to him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699290" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you see him recently?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699291" id2="17" version="1065353216">He might just be on a dig somewhere remote.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699291" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure it's nothing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699292" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never go to a dig site on your own, and never go without making sure someone knows. Second rule of archaeology.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699294" id2="17" version="1065353216">I spoke to him only a little while ago. We met at a cantina on Nar Shaddaa for a little light archaeological talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699296" id2="17" version="1065353216">One old archaeologist is nothing to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699296" id2="17" version="1065353216">What makes you think I care?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699297" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord, with all respect, how can you say that? Doctor Gann is the Empire's premiere Naga Sadow scholar!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699299" id2="17" version="1065353216">You wouldn't have found the ghost on Hoth without me, and I wouldn't have been able to help you if it hadn't been for Auselio Gann.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699300" id2="17" version="1065353216">By that logic, I should thank your mother and father for your birth as well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699300" id2="17" version="1065353216">That makes no sense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699301" id2="17" version="1065353216">You fulfilled your duty as an Imperial soldier. You receive your payment from the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699301" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't owe you anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699302" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine, my lord. But with your permission, I'm going to start looking for him myself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699303" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do as you wish on your own time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699303" id2="17" version="1065353216">It doesn't matter to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699304" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699306" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do not have my permission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699306" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, you may not.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699307" id2="17" version="1065353216">Understood, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699309" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just don't neglect your service to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699309" id2="17" version="1065353216">My work comes first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699310" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course not. I meant no disloyalty to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699312" id2="17" version="1065353216">When was the last time you spoke to him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699312" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine. Tell me about it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699313" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was before I went to Hoth. We met at a cantina on Nar Shaddaa for a little light archaeological talk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699315" id2="17" version="1065353216">He said he was on his way to Malachor Three. That's when he gave me the medallion. It's the last I saw of him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699316" id2="17" version="1065353216">What was this medallion he gave you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699316" id2="17" version="1065353216">Medallion?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699317" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, it was just a knockoff. He said some Hutt tried to pass it off as the real thing. It was quite canny, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699319" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did he act strange at the time?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699319" id2="17" version="1065353216">How was he then?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699320" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not really. Maybe a little at the end.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699322" id2="17" version="1065353216">Malachor Three is pretty remote. He probably just fell out of touch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699322" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a big galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699323" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're probably right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699325" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't help but think of something odd he said just before we left. He gave me the medallion and said something like &quot;in case you need me.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699327" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just thought he'd had too much to drink. He did love to imbibe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699328" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you need my help searching for him, you'll have it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699328" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me know how I can help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699329" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699331" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does the medallion have anything written on it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699331" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps it's a clue.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699332" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, just old runes. Most of it nonsense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699334" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe he got drunk and fell in a tomb.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699334" id2="17" version="1065353216">He doesn't sound too bright.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699335" id2="17" version="1065353216">No! Auselio Gann never drank on the job. Well, maybe a little. But only enough to keep warm.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699337" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure it's nothing. You can't keep an Imperial Reclamation Service man down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699339" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess I'll keep an ear and an eye out. I'll let you know if I discover anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699343" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll never believe what I found! I thought I'd left this behind planets ago!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699344" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is it some kind of artifact?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699344" id2="17" version="1065353216">What is it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699345" id2="17" version="1065353216">The anticipation is killing me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699345" id2="17" version="1065353216">Something dull, I suspect.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699346" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is the tooth off a four-thousand-year-old proto-rancor. But look, see this? It's some kind of metal, not cortosis, but very similar.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699348" id2="17" version="1065353216">This rancor was tamed! It was my very first discovery. I carry it with me everywhere, for luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699350" id2="17" version="1065353216">Much as I admire your enthusiasm, Lieutenant Drellik, do not forget I am your superior.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699350" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds worthless to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course, my lord. I apologize. My excitement sometimes gets the better of me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699353" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's just this was my first discovery--the tooth of a tamed rancor--and I've carried it around with me for ages.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699355" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought I'd lost it when I fell into an old tomb a couple digs ago. It turns out it was caught in the lining of my pocket!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699356" id2="17" version="1065353216">On Korriban, I pulled an artifact from an ancient holocron that was supposed to be unopenable.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699357" id2="17" version="1065353216">You mean from the pyramid in the tomb of Marka Ragnos? How did you do it? With a sonic excavator? Or some device of your own?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699358" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Sith must have some secrets.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699364" id2="17" version="1065353216">Remarkable. How did you come by the number thirty exactly? Was there a clue on the device, or did you simply experiment?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699366" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sith methods are an endless source of fascination to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699367" id2="17" version="1065353216">Actually, I just used lightning. It was a disappointingly obvious solution.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699367" id2="17" version="1065353216">I lied about the blood.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699368" id2="17" version="1065353216">I killed tuk'ata until it opened. Simple.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699368" id2="17" version="1065353216">I used trial and error.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699369" id2="17" version="1065353216">The experimental approach, then. Interesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699371" id2="17" version="1065353216">Speaking of which, I have some new findings to analyze, if you'll excuse me.</text>

		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699372" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was rather elaborate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699373" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fascinating....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699377" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a dizzying process. No wonder it took so long to discover. I am in awe of you, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699379" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was painfully obvious, really. I used lightning.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699379" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just zapped it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699380" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmm. You know, there's a theory in the archaeological world that certain ancient devices, holocrons especially, have resonances.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699382" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's something to do with the Force. Just as only Sith can activate holocrons, some ancient devices can only be activated by certain Sith bloodlines.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699384" id2="17" version="1065353216">Most archaeologists reject it as unscientific. But there's so much about the galaxy we don't understand...who am I to say what's scientific?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699385" id2="17" version="1065353216">Have you worked with many Sith in the past?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699385" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you know a lot of Sith?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699386" id2="17" version="1065353216">Never closely. Usually in a for-hire arrangement.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699388" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperial Reclamation Service may be part of the army, but we get much less funding than our more martial comrades in arms.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699390" id2="17" version="1065353216">People with no knowledge of the Force should not speculate on its workings.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699390" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are nobody.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699391" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry, my lord. I was not attempting to explain the unexplainable. We in the broader archaeological community have great respect for the Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699393" id2="17" version="1065353216">Such theories are only offered to better understand the nature of the items we research, and to improve our techniques.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699395" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not one to dismiss an idea just because it seems a little crazy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699395" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a fascinating theory.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699396" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, my lord, I thought so.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699398" id2="17" version="1065353216">But if you'll excuse me, I have some new findings to analyze.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699400" id2="17" version="1065353216">You built that up way too much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699400" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a dumb story.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699401" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you kidding? This thing has more secrets than half the Sith artifacts you own.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699403" id2="17" version="1065353216">It made my career. Renowned Naga Sadow scholar Auselio Gann caught wind of it and had me assigned to his team.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699405" id2="17" version="1065353216">So how did you go from discovering evidence of domesticated rancors to digging up Sith Lords?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699405" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you're a Sith scholar.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699406" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know. Night and day, aren't they? That was Auselio Gann's doing. He was sort of my mentor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699408" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been digging up Sith artifacts ever since. Speaking of which, I have some new findings to analyze. If you'll excuse me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699412" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you don't mind my asking, how is it you became Sith, my lord? The process is completely foreign to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699414" id2="17" version="1065353216">I had a brother who was Force sensitive. Darth Marr came and took him to Korriban, but we didn't hear from him again after that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699416" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Ungrateful little rat thinks he's too good for us now,&quot; my father said. But really, I think he just missed him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699417" id2="17" version="1065353216">Most of the people who go to Korriban to become Sith die in training.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699417" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your brother's probably dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699418" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't know my brother. He never took no for an answer. We Drellik boys might not look like much, but we fight back!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699420" id2="17" version="1065353216">Many Sith get an extreme sense of superiority and stop talking to their families.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699420" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your father was right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699421" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I ever run into your brother, I'll let you know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699421" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699422" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's alright. We didn't really get along anyway. He was always faster. And stronger. And he usually had a stick in his hand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699424" id2="17" version="1065353216">Father always wanted one son in the Sith and one in the military.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699426" id2="17" version="1065353216">Admittedly, the Imperial Reclamation Service wasn't his first choice, but after all the cursing stopped, I think he warmed up to the idea.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699427" id2="17" version="1065353216">What did your father have against the Imperial Reclamation Service?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699427" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why was he so angry?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699428" id2="17" version="1065353216">When people think of military heroism, they don't generally think of digging in ancient tombs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699428" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't blame him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699429" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, but we serve a vital purpose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699431" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your father is a bit of a jerk, isn't he?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699431" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like a loser.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699432" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Drelliks are a proud family line, and my father is simply the proudest of the lot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699434" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperial Reclamation Service shores up the Empire's foundations against the flood of forgetfulness and misinformation that threatens our history.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699436" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd like to see a fighter pilot establish the lineage of a three-thousand-year-old Sith Lord with nothing but rocks and a dead language.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699437" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have always believed that knowledge will ultimately win out over the lightsaber and the blaster.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699437" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a noble profession.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699438" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, my lord. It is my honor to serve.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699439" id2="17" version="1065353216">You and the fighter pilot must bow to the Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699439" id2="17" version="1065353216">Both roles are weak.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699440" id2="17" version="1065353216">But who can compare to a Sith, my lord? No one in the Republic or the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699441" id2="17" version="1065353216">It sounds as if you were too frightened to pick up a blaster and fight for your Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699441" id2="17" version="1065353216">I smell cowardice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699442" id2="17" version="1065353216">Destiny calls each to his own duty. Who am I to argue with destiny?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699446" id2="17" version="1065353216">So explain this to me. The tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban was built by Tulak Hord before Naga Sadow was even born?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699448" id2="17" version="1065353216">And that's where you found the Dashade shadow-killer?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699450" id2="17" version="1065353216">And when your master tried to steal your body, you used the artifacts of Tulak Hord to put her being into this Dashade?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699451" id2="17" version="1065353216">Somehow when you describe it, it sounds completely nuts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699451" id2="17" version="1065353216">It made more sense back then.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699452" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's our job to piece together the puzzle of history.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699454" id2="17" version="1065353216">You forgot the part where I received aid from my long-dead ancestor who was murdered by Tulak Hord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699454" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't forget Kallig.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699455" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kallig! He was one of the most powerful Sith Lords of his time. Perhaps the most powerful. And an alien too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699457" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kallig! He was one of the most powerful Sith Lords of his time. Perhaps the most powerful. Oddly pro-alien.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699459" id2="17" version="1065353216">To think how the Empire might have been different if he had killed Tulak Hord and not the other way around.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699461" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where did you hear all this?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699461" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did you know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699462" id2="17" version="1065353216">Darth Zash and I have been talking. Well, when she's around. I would love to speak more with Khem Val, but I don't think he likes me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699463" id2="17" version="1065353216">He only eats Force users.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699463" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry about him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699464" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, I'd read much about his species but never seen one in person. Still, when he gets that hungry glint in his eye....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699466" id2="17" version="1065353216">Being locked in stasis for hundreds of years was hard on him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699466" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure he'll come around.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699467" id2="17" version="1065353216">Heh. You know, I never thought of it that way. Yes, I'm sure that's it. Perhaps I could give him a few social pointers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699468" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure he'd appreciate that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699468" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699469" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excellent. I will speak with him at the next opportunity.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699471" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would leave him alone, if I were you. He's liable to become violent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699471" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't advise it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699472" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nonsense. The monsters I've encountered in the dark corners of tombs make Khem Val look positively civilized.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699474" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're hardly the model of social grace yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699474" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd be a terrible teacher.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699475" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, at least I'm polite.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699477" id2="17" version="1065353216">Khem Val respects strength. You're a little on the weak side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699477" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can see why.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699478" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, I'd say that's a matter of debate. They don't give lieutenant stripes to just everyone you know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699480" id2="17" version="1065353216">But your adventures sound fascinating. Five artifacts of Tulak Hord!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699482" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand you inherited quite the archive from Zash. I would love to see it some time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699483" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would love to show it to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699483" id2="17" version="1065353216">Certainly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699484" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excellent. The quest for knowledge is eternal!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699485" id2="17" version="1065353216">The knowledge of the Sith is not meant for weaklings like you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699485" id2="17" version="1065353216">You presume too much.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699486" id2="17" version="1065353216">My apologies. The quest for knowledge is neverending, but perhaps I overstepped.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699487" id2="17" version="1065353216">Some knowledge isn't meant to be seen, you understand.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="699487" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699488" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nonsense. For people like us, the quest for knowledge is neverending.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699490" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I could have a moment of your time the next time we're on the ship, that would be wonderful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699491" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you have a moment, can we talk?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="699492" id2="17" version="1065353216">I really do enjoy our conversations, but I'm a little too busy to talk right now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="762697" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm so sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="762698" id2="17" version="1065353216">What happened?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="762700" id2="17" version="1065353216">The he got what he deserved.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="762708" id2="17" version="1065353216">My pleasure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="762709" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's what friends are for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988512" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, my lord. Ready when you are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988513" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988514" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988515" id2="17" version="1065353216">The historical mind is ever curious and never sated!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988516" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's an honor to serve you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988517" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, my lord! With pleasure!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988518" id2="17" version="1065353216">This shouldn't take too long.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988519" id2="17" version="1065353216">I promise, I won't let you down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="988520" id2="17" version="1065353216">If there's any way I can aid you, my lord, let me know.</text>
