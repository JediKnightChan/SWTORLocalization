		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640851" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were pretty harsh. If the Council had listened to your recommendation, I'd be locked up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640852" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was only doing my job, Padawan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640852" id2="17" version="1065353216">It wasn't personal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640853" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your job. Right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640855" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep up that attitude and you'll find out just how harsh I can be.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640855" id2="17" version="1065353216">That can still be arranged.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640856" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have a pretty clear idea of that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640858" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just so you know, I won't hold a grudge about this. Wouldn't be very Jedi-like.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640860" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's get back to work, Master.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640861" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't think I didn't notice the risk you took by standing up for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640863" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the second time you made me have an inappropriate urge. Knock it off.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640864" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never felt this close to Master Kiwiiks. Your support was... special.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640865" id2="17" version="1065353216">I felt stronger having you there. You're a good Master--and a good friend.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640866" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll always help you however I can, Kira. That's my job as your teacher.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640866" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just doing my duty.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640867" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do more than any Master should, and I'm grateful for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anytime. I'm just glad we're staying a team.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640869" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] It was my pleasure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640870" id2="17" version="1065353216">That goes double for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640872" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640874" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're in this together. I know you'd do the same for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640874" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're welcome.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640875" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would now. After this, I owe you a few dozen....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640877" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't risk my reputation for you again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640877" id2="17" version="1065353216">Time for you to grow up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640878" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be on my best behavior from here on out. Padawan's honor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640880" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad that's finally over. For a minute I thought the Jedi Council might lock me up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640882" id2="17" version="1065353216">That would've been anti-climactic. Our mission's not done yet. Ready to get back to work?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640883" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's show Darth Angral and the Emperor they can't push us around.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640883" id2="17" version="1065353216">As long as you're with me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640884" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Council gave you a free pass, but they can't make me trust you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640884" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be watching you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640885" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. That's my job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640887" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ready to go whenever you are, Master.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640888" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just because you're staying doesn't mean you're going out on missions. Ever.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640888" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're never leaving my ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640889" id2="17" version="1065353216">Cutting me out of the loop, huh? That's your mistake to make.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640891" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you leave me on the ship all the time, I might be forced to redecorate it while you save the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640898" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look on the bright side... now you know all my dark secrets. No more surprises here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640901" id2="17" version="1065353216">You were going to abandon me. No questions, no chance to explain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640902" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't have let him take you. I was only trying to keep him off balance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640902" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was bluffing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640903" id2="17" version="1065353216">I saw how you looked at me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640905" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just found out you and the Emperor are relatives. What did you expect?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640905" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can you blame me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640906" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't know the whole story.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640908" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't imagine any explanation that will make me trust you again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640908" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640909" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't expect trust. I'll settle for you knowing who I really am.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640911" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks for sticking by me. I know this was a big shock, but I can explain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640913" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should've told you the truth a long time ago.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640915" id2="17" version="1065353216">My parents were Sith--but the Emperor isn't my father. &quot;Child of the Emperor&quot; is just a title.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640917" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was taken from my parents when I was a baby. Raised in the Sith Academy with others like Valis. It was... brutal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640918" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can only imagine the pain you must have endured.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640918" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640919" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pain became normal. There were worse things.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640921" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why raise you in the Sith Academy? What were you being trained for?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640921" id2="17" version="1065353216">What was the purpose?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640922" id2="17" version="1065353216">About what you'd expect. Learn how to kill Jedi and do other horrible things. But that wasn't all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640924" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've been taught the ways of the dark side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640924" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, you're a trained Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640925" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sort of. Never been much of a student--and some things I'd rather forget.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640927" id2="17" version="1065353216">Every so often, the other Children were taken to see our &quot;father.&quot; They came back different. Nobody ever remembered meeting the Emperor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640929" id2="17" version="1065353216">One day, I realized I couldn't remember anything from the past week. They were doing the same thing to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640930" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm starting to understand. You escaped the Sith, didn't you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640930" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you ran away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640931" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nobody treats me like a droid and gets away with it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640933" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever the Sith did, it's buried in your memories. We have to uncover it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640933" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need to know what happened.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640934" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've tried. Every time I get close to a memory, it changes. Slithers away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640936" id2="17" version="1065353216">All I'm hearing is you're a liar and you're crazy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640936" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't trust you at all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640937" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not crazy. Sometimes I can almost remember what happened... but it's like something out of a nightmare.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640939" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was still a child then. Small enough to stow away on a supply ship leaving Imperial space.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640941" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lived in lots of bad places until I met Master Kiwiiks. She brought me to the Jedi. Changed my life.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640942" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did you tell Master Kiwiiks about your past?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640942" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does she know the truth?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640943" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. How would I even begin? &quot;By the way, I was born a Sith. Is that a problem?&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640945" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've been keeping secrets, Kira. That's not what Jedi do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640945" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not enough, apparently.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640946" id2="17" version="1065353216">That stupid old woman brought an enemy into our ranks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640946" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kiwiiks was a fool.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640947" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's not stupid. Maybe I'm not the best Jedi, but I'm no Sith either.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640949" id2="17" version="1065353216">Always knew sooner or later I'd have to come clean. Just hoped I could prove myself as a Jedi first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640951" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now the Emperor knows where I am, the Sith will never stop hunting me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640952" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Satele and the others need to know about this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640952" id2="17" version="1065353216">We should tell the Council.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640953" id2="17" version="1065353216">They'll take you over my dead body.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640953" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] I'll protect you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640954" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't figure you out. A minute ago you were about to abandon me here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640956" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm having a very inappropriate urge to kiss you... but I won't.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640958" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm surprised you still talk to me after all this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640960" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're my Padawan, Kira. I made a promise to keep you safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640960" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't let them touch you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640961" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know I haven't been a great Padawan, but I'm going to try harder.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640963" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm ready to tell the truth--Master Kiwiiks, the Jedi Council, everyone. No more secrets.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640965" id2="17" version="1065353216">We should probably let the general know he's not getting his admiral.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640966" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're more trouble than you're worth. First chance I get, I'm dumping you off on Tython.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="640966" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're a liability.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640967" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine. Turn me in to the Council. I bet they'll be more open-minded.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640969" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's go. The general's waiting to hear from you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="640971" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't like it. This mission has &quot;trap&quot; written all over it.</text>
