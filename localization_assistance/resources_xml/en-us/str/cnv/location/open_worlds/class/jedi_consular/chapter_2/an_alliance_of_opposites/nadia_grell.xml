		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641886" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hello? You're the Jedi they were sending, yes? I--I can't talk any louder, someone might hear.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641888" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm Nadia Grell. My father and the other Senators--we were all invited here by the Chancellor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641890" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then the ship was attacked. Boarded. By people calling themselves &quot;Sith&quot;.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641891" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nadia, make sure no one can find you before we talk anymore.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="641891" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you somewhere safe?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641892" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm in an air vent on the command deck. I can't go too far from the bridge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641894" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is everyone alright?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="641894" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any injuries?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641895" id2="17" version="1065353216">The captain's dead. He was so nice... and the crew. Most of them are dead, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641897" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you have any idea what the Sith are up to?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="641897" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do they want?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641898" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know. But I've seen them tampering with the engines.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641900" id2="17" version="1065353216">The one in charge is called Arrax; he just cut his way through the crew. Then he ordered all the Senators onto the bridge and locked it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641902" id2="17" version="1065353216">My father's in there! But I can't get to him. I just hid.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641903" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't fret, Nadia. None of this is your fault.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="641903" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's alright.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641904" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please, you have to save him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641906" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I can reach them, I can protect the Senators, and your father.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="641906" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can the bridge be unlocked?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641907" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arrax would have probably killed you if you'd tried anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="641907" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd be dead otherwise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641908" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know. I couldn't....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641910" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's a console on one of the lower decks that can open the bridge. Here, I'll send you the location.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641912" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please help us. If they're doing something with the engines, there might not be much time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641913" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please hurry. I saw the Sith tampering with the engines. We might not have a lot of time.</text>
