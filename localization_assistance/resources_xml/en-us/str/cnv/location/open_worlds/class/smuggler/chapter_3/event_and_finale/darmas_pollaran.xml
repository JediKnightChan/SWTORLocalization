		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518039" id2="17" version="1065353216">I checked into all of Ivory's bolt-holes--the one on Tatooine seems to be the one still active.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518040" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rogun always shows up to spoil my good time. Let's give him a taste.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518040" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I'm going to Tatooine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518041" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here here. I bet I could get a good bid price to see the look on his face.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518043" id2="17" version="1065353216">You always know what will make me happy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518043" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] Thanks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518044" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I could, I'd give you his head in silver tinsel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518046" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I think you'll enjoy that fruit more if you pluck it yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518048" id2="17" version="1065353216">What else do you know?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518049" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've put Rogun about out of commission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518051" id2="17" version="1065353216">All he's got left is a handful of loyal killers, and he wants them to take you down in a blaze of glory. Don't let him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518053" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me tie up some loose ends, and I'll head over when I can.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518053" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got some things to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518054" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't wait long, Captain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518056" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is your chance to wipe the slate and call the biggest criminal empire in the galaxy your own.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518060" id2="17" version="1065353216">Captain... I just received an interesting offer from one of Rogun's former men. Seems he's got some exotic cavalry that needs a home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518062" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your doing, I trust?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518063" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rogun's pipeline was through Gormak Zak, and Zak works for me now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518063" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rogun's business is ours.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518064" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've got the magic, Captain. Won't be another crook in the galaxy who can touch you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518066" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hear you had some trouble on Voss, hmm, Captain?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518068" id2="17" version="1065353216">Senator Dodonna asked me to call. She's busy defending her decision to send such an undiplomatic ambassador to Voss at a crucial time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518070" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any success learning Rogun's business?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518071" id2="17" version="1065353216">Rogun's pipeline to Voss is gone for good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518071" id2="17" version="1065353216">I shut him down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518072" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure the Senator will sleep easier knowing she won't wake up to a cyborg nexu on the pillow.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518074" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've got Rogun in full retreat. He's calling his surviving lieutenants for a war council.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518075" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Voss are convinced there was a Sith behind the smuggling; they should shut down the ring and maybe toss out the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518075" id2="17" version="1065353216">I got Rogun and the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518076" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, look at you going beyond the call of duty. Never figured you for an overachiever.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518078" id2="17" version="1065353216">It sounds like Rogun's hurting, though. He just called a war council for all his surviving lieutenants.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518079" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want to congratulate me, I can think of better ways than a comlink.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518079" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Flirt] Let's celebrate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518080" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then you're not having the right conversations, my dear.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518082" id2="17" version="1065353216">Uh-oh, the line's getting staticky. I think we're about to lose you!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518084" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, I didn't realize you're not alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518086" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our time is short anyway; we just got word that Rogun is gathering his surviving lieutenants for some kind of war council.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518087" id2="17" version="1065353216">When do we get to smash Rogun's face in?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518087" id2="17" version="1065353216">That scum set me up again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="518088" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's done. What now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518089" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your timing couldn't be better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="518091" id2="17" version="1065353216">We just received word that Rogun is calling a war council for all his surviving lieutenants.</text>
