		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482715" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah yes, I can sense the new power within you. Good. Then I would suggest--</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="482717" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master, enough of this. You are full to bursting. Strike now before your enemy makes another move.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482719" id2="17" version="1065353216">For once, I agree with the monster. Break into Thanaton's meditation chamber and blast him with all those dead Sith you've piled up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482720" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then set a course for Dromund Kaas.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482720" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482721" id2="17" version="1065353216">You got it, Captain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482723" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where's this meditation chamber again?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482723" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do I get to him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482724" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dromund Kaas. The Citadel. You say the word, I'll set the course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482726" id2="17" version="1065353216">The ghosts don't do anything. It's just raw power.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482726" id2="17" version="1065353216">It doesn't work that way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482727" id2="17" version="1065353216">However it works. So long as Thanaton's dead when you're done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482729" id2="17" version="1065353216">But if you face him with his defenses up like last time, you're toast. Don't forget it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482731" id2="17" version="1065353216">If there's any way I can aid you, my lord, let me know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482733" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lightsaber is ready, should you have need.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="482735" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanaton will make an excellent meal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482740" id2="17" version="1065353216">I trust our friend Harkun is doing well?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482742" id2="17" version="1065353216">If your business is finished on Korriban, it's time we looked for another spirit to bind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482743" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about this ghost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482743" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have my attention.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482744" id2="17" version="1065353216">If it were up to me, we'd attack Thanaton now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482744" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do we need another ghost?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482745" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't think that's a good idea.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482747" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've had this discussion before.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482749" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanaton will not be caught off guard this time. You must shore up enough power to destroy him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482751" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope you've turned up more than rumors.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482751" id2="17" version="1065353216">You mean Hoth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482752" id2="17" version="1065353216">One man's rumors are another man's Force-fortifying ghosts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482754" id2="17" version="1065353216">We think what Andronikos has heard is true.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482756" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Republic transport crashed over Hoth about a year ago. It was carrying artifacts from a Sith tomb that the Jedi had confiscated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482757" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think they got the tomb's chief resident as well?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482757" id2="17" version="1065353216">Artifacts and a ghost?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482758" id2="17" version="1065353216">More likely than not.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482760" id2="17" version="1065353216">Confiscated is the perfect euphemism, isn't it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482760" id2="17" version="1065353216">You mean robbed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482761" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Sith is in no place to judge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482763" id2="17" version="1065353216">What did the Jedi want with Sith artifacts?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482763" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why did the Jedi take them?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482764" id2="17" version="1065353216">What does it matter? They never reached their destination.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482766" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Jedi never recovered the transport. I don't like the idea of binding the dead like this, but if you have to, I'd start looking for that transport.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482769" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your old apprentices are dead, but they managed to steal the key to Thanaton's meditation chamber.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482770" id2="17" version="1065353216">And so goes the last of my legacy--yourself excepted. But this key, perhaps their death was not such a waste.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482772" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanaton's private mediation chamber would be the perfect place for an ambush.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482774" id2="17" version="1065353216">We done playing with ghosts yet? Where I come from, man takes your dignity, you break his teeth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482776" id2="17" version="1065353216">We shouldn't rush to seek revenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482778" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can't afford haste. I'd advise against facing Thanaton until you've gained more power.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482779" id2="17" version="1065353216">He killed my apprentices--your apprentices. Whatever. I will crush him!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482779" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want him dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482780" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do I do that? I don't know where any more ghosts are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482780" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's your advice?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482781" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need to find another ghost.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482781" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's get going.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482782" id2="17" version="1065353216">Y'know, it's just hearsay, but there've been strange rumors coming off Hoth lately. Ships crashing mysteriously, crews hearing voices.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482784" id2="17" version="1065353216">Some pretty level-headed people I know are spooked.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482786" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ashara and I will look into these Hoth rumors. In the meantime, you should consider replacing your apprentices.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482788" id2="17" version="1065353216">You will appear weak if you don't try to restore what Thanaton destroyed. I've heard a new group of acolytes have arrived on Korriban.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482790" id2="17" version="1065353216">Slaves. The kind that Thanaton always passes on. Our old friend Harkun is training them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482791" id2="17" version="1065353216">It will be wonderful to see Harkun again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482791" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excellent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482792" id2="17" version="1065353216">I already have an apprentice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482792" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's wrong with Ashara?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482793" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanaton took two apprentices from you. And fallen or not, this one can hardly be called Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482795" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should have let me kill that imbecile when we had the chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482795" id2="17" version="1065353216">I spit on Harkun.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482796" id2="17" version="1065353216">He can be difficult to suffer at times, but he may yet prove useful to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482798" id2="17" version="1065353216">An apprentice from Korriban is a special honor. It says you have status, and you will have your pick of the group.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482800" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go to Korriban while we study these Hoth rumors your pirate friend produced.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482804" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord, you're back!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482806" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thought you were gone. Guy could get trampled by a bantha herd and not get knocked around as bad as you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482808" id2="17" version="1065353216">We followed Thanaton's servants, cut them down and pulled you out of a ditch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482810" id2="17" version="1065353216">You didn't have a pulse at first, but then Kaal noticed you were still warm. I don't know how you survived that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482811" id2="17" version="1065353216">That explains why I'm still alive. Where's Thanaton?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482811" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about Thanaton?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482812" id2="17" version="1065353216">You sure you're ready to face him? He did a real number on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482814" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought these spirits were supposed to protect me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482814" id2="17" version="1065353216">What happened?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482815" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the remarkable part. As far as I can tell, they did.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482817" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess I should thank you, then.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482817" id2="17" version="1065353216">I owe you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482818" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are our master, my lord. Without you, we are orphans.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482820" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your survival is the most remarkable thing I've ever witnessed. I still can't quite figure it out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482822" id2="17" version="1065353216">It seems Thanaton's ritual was too powerful for your shield, but he didn't fully understand the bond between you and the dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482824" id2="17" version="1065353216">To kill you, he would've had to purge their spirits. You died, and their very presence kept you alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482826" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's great, but what do we do? We can't wait for Thanaton to come back and kill us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482827" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll find the most powerful dead in the galaxy, bind them, and take their power. Thanaton won't stand a chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482827" id2="17" version="1065353216">Power first, then revenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482828" id2="17" version="1065353216">Zash, do you know of any powerful artifacts or rituals we could use to defeat Thanaton?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482828" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any ideas, Zash?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482829" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanaton guards those secrets jealously, and he took most of my research after I was... after the incident.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482831" id2="17" version="1065353216">If only we knew Thanaton's vulnerability... he's not part cyborg by any chance?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482831" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does Thanaton have a weakness?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482832" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, Thanaton despises modification of that kind. He only defended Skotia because he liked me less.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482834" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need to make it so that Thanaton can't break through your shield.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482836" id2="17" version="1065353216">Corrin's right. His servants said he looked pretty drained after he knocked you out. Just a little more power....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482838" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a gamble. None of us know what the cost of acquiring so much power so quickly could be.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482839" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm well aware of the cost, but I'll risk it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482839" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take my chances.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482840" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't exactly have other options, do we?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482842" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you have an alternative?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Exactly. Better to do something than sit here and wait to be killed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482845" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've bound two so far and nothing's gone wrong yet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482845" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry about me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482846" id2="17" version="1065353216">Suit yourself. But as you know--rituals don't always go as planned.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482848" id2="17" version="1065353216">So where do we find more ghosts?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482850" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Jedi on Taris were investigating something of that nature; I sent a man to investigate shortly before my unfortunate change.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482852" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd have to do more research on the matter to confirm, but I suggest making contact with him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482853" id2="17" version="1065353216">One won't be enough. When I face Thanaton again, I want to crush him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482853" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need more.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482854" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482855" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doesn't anyone have anything more... solid?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="482855" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're all useless.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482856" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wish we had more to go on, but right now, that's all I have.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="482858" id2="17" version="1065353216">Corrin and I will dig around too--and we'll keep an eye on Thanaton. If he makes a move, we'll let you know. Good luck, my lord.</text>
