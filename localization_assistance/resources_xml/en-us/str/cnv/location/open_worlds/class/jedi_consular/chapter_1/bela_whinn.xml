		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641997" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hold your fire, men! Hold your fire! It's the Jedi the Council sent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="641999" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry, Jedi. We're all a little on edge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642000" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand you have every right to be on edge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642000" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't blame you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642001" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks. We've contained Laranna, but I don't know what to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642003" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everyone okay?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642004" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're pretty shook up but at least we're alive. No thanks to Laranna.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642006" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just tell me where Laranna Fain is.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642006" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm here for your passenger.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642007" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's, uh, well, we managed to trap her in the aft section of the ship. This is all so wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642009" id2="17" version="1065353216">She was a great passenger at first--happy, smart, interested in the ship. But then we were hit by an Imperial ambush.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642011" id2="17" version="1065353216">Laranna fought them off, almost died from her wounds. After a day or so, she started talking strange. And then... the slaughter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642012" id2="17" version="1065353216">So she was hurt, and then she went insane?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642012" id2="17" version="1065353216">The injury started it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642013" id2="17" version="1065353216">What was she saying that seemed odd?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642013" id2="17" version="1065353216">Talking strange?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642014" id2="17" version="1065353216">Always the same thing: &quot;Darkness, the darkness is coming.&quot; But--wait, that started later.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642016" id2="17" version="1065353216">If she was so badly injured, why couldn't you stop her?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642016" id2="17" version="1065353216">But she was &quot;almost dead.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642017" id2="17" version="1065353216">It didn't go like that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642019" id2="17" version="1065353216">After the ambush, we put out a call for medical assistance, and a Jedi Master answered. He healed her right up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642021" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was... odd, though. Had these horrible scars he kept covering, never said his name. You know, Laranna was different after he left.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642022" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's possible he wasn't a Jedi at all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642022" id2="17" version="1065353216">An imposter, perhaps?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642023" id2="17" version="1065353216">But he healed her. The girl's as strong as a rancor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642025" id2="17" version="1065353216">Other Jedi are suffering from a similar illness; he could have given it to her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642025" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe he made her sick.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642026" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't think so--he healed her. She's as strong as ever. Stronger, even.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642028" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a struggle, but we managed to trap her in the aft section. If I can just--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642030" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right now, it's more important that we focus on stopping her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642030" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget him.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642031" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right. We managed to trap her in the stern of the ship, but we--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642033" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lieutenant Whinn! Laranna's slicing into the Carida's systems!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642035" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's taking over the whole ship. She'll start shutting down life support soon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642037" id2="17" version="1065353216">No! Jedi, please! You're the only one who stands a chance of stopping her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642039" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do whatever you have to. Just don't let Laranna kill any more of my men.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642040" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will not fail.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642041" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe Laranna would listen to a fellow Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642041" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll see what can be done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="642042" id2="17" version="1065353216">This won't be a challenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642043" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. I'll release the lockdown for a moment to let you in, but I won't risk Laranna getting out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="642045" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's a comm device back there; contact me when you've taken care of her, and I'll release the lockdown again so you can leave. Good luck.</text>
