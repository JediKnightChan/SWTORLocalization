		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635254" id2="17" version="1065353216">Backup! We need backup!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635255" id2="17" version="1065353216">Temporary crew quarters are just outside the hangar doors, Lieutenant. Go and find yourself a bunk before all the good ones are taken.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635256" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good day, Lieutenant. Welcome aboard the Justice. Need to run a few questions by you before you head on into the crew area.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635257" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go right ahead, Lieutenant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635257" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sure thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635258" id2="17" version="1065353216">What kind of questions?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635258" id2="17" version="1065353216">Questions?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635259" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nothing major--just a couple of quick questions to help with the personnel tracking.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635261" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't have time for your stupid questions, all right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635261" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bother someone else.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635262" id2="17" version="1065353216">So make time. Tavus says ask everyone, so I'm asking everyone. Take it up with him--after we're done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635264" id2="17" version="1065353216">Which planet were you posted on, Lieutenant? Who did you serve with?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635265" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was posted on that wrecked, swamp hole Taris. Needles was in charge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635265" id2="17" version="1065353216">Needles, on Taris.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635266" id2="17" version="1065353216">Taris? I heard some bad stuff went down on Taris.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635268" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, uh, so tell me... did Needles really test that bioweapon on his own people? Turn them into monsters?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635269" id2="17" version="1065353216">Needles was completely insane.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635269" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's affirmative.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635270" id2="17" version="1065353216">Totally unbelievable. Sounds like you were lucky to get out alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635272" id2="17" version="1065353216">They were all ten meters tall and breathing fire by the end.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635272" id2="17" version="1065353216">Horrible monsters!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635273" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've got to be kidding me! Needles must have been pretty cracked.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635275" id2="17" version="1065353216">You shouldn't believe everything you hear, Lieutenant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635275" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's ridiculous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635276" id2="17" version="1065353216">No--but the guys I talked to... something must have really gotten to them out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635278" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was stuck bowing to noblemen on Alderaan. Gearbox was running the show.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635278" id2="17" version="1065353216">Gearbox, on Alderaan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635279" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh yeah? Some of the other guys were telling me Gearbox put together his own assault walker--really advanced stuff. Is it true?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635280" id2="17" version="1065353216">I saw the thing with my own eyes, Lieutenant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635280" id2="17" version="1065353216">One hundred percent true.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635281" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll bet it was pretty impressive. Too bad the prototype couldn't be salvaged, huh? Wouldn't mind riding into battle on one of those babies!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635283" id2="17" version="1065353216">That thing was a hunk of junk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635283" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was worthless.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635284" id2="17" version="1065353216">Really? That's not what the other guys were saying. Guess they were just easily impressed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635286" id2="17" version="1065353216">You really think that old man could build a battle walker?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635286" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're joking, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635287" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come on--Gearbox wasn't really old. And he was pretty brilliant. So yeah, I'd buy it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635289" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was stationed on some rock called Tatooine. With Fuse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635289" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fuse, on Tatooine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635290" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fuse, huh? Some other guys from Tatooine were telling me he cracked out there--that he suddenly just refused to continue his work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635291" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fuse totally lost it. He even locked himself in a closet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635291" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's right, Lieutenant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635292" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wow. Guess it's never the ones you expect, huh? I mean, he was in Havoc Squad--you'd think he could keep it together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635294" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fuse didn't crack, he just refused to butcher civilians.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635294" id2="17" version="1065353216">He had morals.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635295" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, you ask me, you're better off dead than living on that rock.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635297" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never even saw Fuse. I don't know what happened.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635297" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635298" id2="17" version="1065353216">So what about this other rumor I keep hearing? That a single Republic soldier came in and broke up the entire operation? Is that really true?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635299" id2="17" version="1065353216">The guy was a killing machine--I still have nightmares.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635299" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's true, Lieutenant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635300" id2="17" version="1065353216">A real one-woman army--and she didn't take prisoners.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635300" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's true, Lieutenant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635301" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds pretty serious. But hey, you made it--we're in the clear, now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635303" id2="17" version="1065353216">The soldier who took us out wasn't alone--there were two of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635303" id2="17" version="1065353216">It wasn't just one soldier.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635304" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still, though--two soldiers just show up and take entire operations apart? Whoever they are, I hope I never run into them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635306" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never thought one soldier could do so much damage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635306" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was incredible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635307" id2="17" version="1065353216">Me either. Guess we'd all better stay on our toes, huh?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635309" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, I won't hold you up any longer, Lieutenant. Go on and head for the crew area. I'll bet you could use some rest after what you've been through.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635311" id2="17" version="1065353216">See you around.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="635318" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah--that was me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635319" id2="17" version="1065353216">What? Intruders! We've got intruders! Sound the alarm, put all sections on alert!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635321" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome aboard, sir.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="635322" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not sure that uniform is regulation, soldier.</text>
