		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633810" id2="17" version="1065353216">Captain. It's good to see you back--it was a mess out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633812" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dorne and I almost didn't make it--I'd be dead if not for her. And now she's paying for it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633814" id2="17" version="1065353216">She wouldn't take no for an answer. Had to patch me up, even under heavy fire. She took a lot of hits out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633815" id2="17" version="1065353216">What is Dorne's status now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633815" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will she be alright?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633816" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dorne's too damn brave for her own good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633816" id2="17" version="1065353216">What was she thinking?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633817" id2="17" version="1065353216">Elara isn't my favorite person in the galaxy, but she should get a medal for this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633819" id2="17" version="1065353216">It sounds like you took a few hits yourself--are you alright?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633819" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633820" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll be fine, thanks to her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633822" id2="17" version="1065353216">How did the Imps manage to surprise you like that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633822" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want an explanation!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633823" id2="17" version="1065353216">They didn't surprise us at all. We knew they were coming, but we couldn't pull out without that data from the bridge computers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633825" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuun and I managed to take care of the worst of her wounds--she'll pull through. But it was a close call.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633826" id2="17" version="1065353216">Make sure she's stable and keep me updated.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633826" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep an eye on her.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633827" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633829" id2="17" version="1065353216">The important thing is that you both got out of there. I'm proud of you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633829" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did well, Jorgan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633830" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't think she would've left me behind if I'd shot her myself--and I wasn't about to let that ex-Imp upstage me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633832" id2="17" version="1065353216">You two should've kept better control of the situation.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633832" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too close for my tastes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633833" id2="17" version="1065353216">I fought harder out there than I've ever fought in my life, and so did she! If you want more than that, then get used to being disappointed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633835" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, yeah. It's all my fault. Maybe one of these days you'll slip up and forget you hate me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633837" id2="17" version="1065353216">You two want to talk about this later? We're sitting on a superweapon that's strapped to blow.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633838" id2="17" version="1065353216">Double-time it, people! We're getting out of here!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633838" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633839" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's get this ship moving and finish this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633839" id2="17" version="1065353216">The mission is almost over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633840" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed! Let the Empire remember why they fear the heroes of Havoc Squad!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633842" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one's dead yet. Let's finish what we came here to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="633842" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everyone get a grip!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="633843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Agreed--our heroic task is all but accomplished. Let the Imperials quake at the strength of democracy!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="633845" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuun will see that the ship is prepared for launch. Once we are clear of the Gauntlet, we can contact General Garza with a situation report.</text>
