		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536305" id2="17" version="1065353216">We won't forget what you did for us, Master Jedi. My men will let you through the ray shield whenever you're ready to leave.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536306" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll secure the base and clean up this mess. You should talk to the other Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536307" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's it--we did it! With the ray shields up, we can hold out until reinforcements get here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536309" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then we kill our enemies. Yes. Destroy them to the last man.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536311" id2="17" version="1065353216">No... no. That's not... I told you! I shouldn't have done this!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536313" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hang on... we've got movement outside the ray shield. Who is that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536315" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a mystery the Force can be. I came seeking a traitor, but found you instead. The time draws near.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536316" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're too late. You won't be killing anyone for the Emperor today.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536316" id2="17" version="1065353216">You failed, executioner.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536317" id2="17" version="1065353216">A minor disappointment, eclipsed by this curious discovery.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536319" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not making any sense. Do you know me, Sith?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536319" id2="17" version="1065353216">The time for what?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536320" id2="17" version="1065353216">Many know your name. Some whisper it, others shout it. I alone recognize what it means.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536322" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you mean the time of your death, I'll have the lieutenant open the ray shield now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536322" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm going to kill you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536323" id2="17" version="1065353216">Reckonings arrive at their own pace. No need to rush them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536325" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're strong and touched by darkness. That is unexpected. An advantage? Possibly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536327" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're young, strong, confident. Is it enough? We will see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536329" id2="17" version="1065353216">You may keep the Dark Council traitor. I smell his weakness. He'll die by his own hand, given the chance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536330" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sajar will receive the help he needs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536330" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll keep him safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536331" id2="17" version="1065353216">A waste of your time and talents. He isn't worthy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536333" id2="17" version="1065353216">What will your master say when you return empty-handed?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536333" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about the Emperor?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536334" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll bring him news of his most hated enemy. The traitor will be forgotten.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536336" id2="17" version="1065353216">Admit it. You don't want to face me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="536336" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think you fear me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536337" id2="17" version="1065353216">Arrogant and prideful. Surprising in so many ways.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536339" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Emperor must hear of our meeting. I won't disappoint him with delays. Farewell, for now....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536341" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is it freezing in here, or is that just my blood crystallizing?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536343" id2="17" version="1065353216">So that was the Emperor's Wrath. Fun nickname.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536345" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've seen my share of Sith. That's one you shouldn't face alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="536347" id2="17" version="1065353216">T7 scans = complete // Emperor's Wrath = Sith physiology + unknown biochemical enhancements // Extreme caution = strongly advised</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536349" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know what that was all about, but I hope he doesn't come back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536351" id2="17" version="1065353216">No offense, but that other Jedi's brought us nothing but bad luck. We might be better off if he left.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536353" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's still hiding in his room. Maybe you can talk some sense into him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536354" id2="17" version="1065353216">My engineers tell me that other Jedi helped them set up the ray shields in half the time. He really came through for us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536356" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's back in his room, asking to see you. Thank him for me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536357" id2="17" version="1065353216">That other Jedi seemed pretty upset. Maybe you ought to talk to him while we secure things here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536359" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperials are breaching the main doors--hurry!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536360" id2="17" version="1065353216">More enemies coming in! They're everywhere!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536361" id2="17" version="1065353216">The enemy breached our rear defenses! You've got to get back there!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="536362" id2="17" version="1065353216">The shields are almost up! We've got to hold the line!</text>
