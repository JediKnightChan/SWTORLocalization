		<text bitflag="3393" id1="544062" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a pleasure to meet you, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="544063" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not far from where you were born, I think.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638678" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are the slime, the filth, the wretches of society. You are what Sith Lords scrape off their boots.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638680" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe you'll be lucky enough to crawl out of that muck and make something of yourselves. More likely, you'll die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638682" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's my job to see that it's one or the other.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638683" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, Harkun, how good to see you again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638683" id2="17" version="1065353216">My old friend.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638684" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord, it's always a pleasure to see you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638686" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know why the Sith Empire even bothers with you. Miserable curs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638688" id2="17" version="1065353216">They'd be wiser to give you shovels and have you dig your own graves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638689" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, Harkun, good to see you haven't changed one bit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638689" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still the same jerk.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638690" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, well, my lord. I certainly never expected to see you again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638692" id2="17" version="1065353216">I take it these are the new acolytes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638692" id2="17" version="1065353216">A new group, I see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638693" id2="17" version="1065353216">My lord. You clean up well. Yes, these are the acolytes--a worse bunch than yours if you ask me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638695" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ahem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638696" id2="17" version="1065353216">Apologies, my lord. I didn't notice you there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638698" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was just preparing these new slaves for their imminent death.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638700" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you here for an apprentice, or were you just feeling nostalgic?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638701" id2="17" version="1065353216">Darth Thanaton killed my last two apprentices.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638701" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need a new apprentice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638702" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, I'd heard about that. They were incompetents anyway. Not that this group looks much better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638704" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm certainly not here to see you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638704" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nostalgia? Don't kid yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638705" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still as prickly and arrogant as ever, eh, slave? I mean, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638707" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was just thinking of what good times we had together. Well, that and my apprentices were just ruthlessly killed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638707" id2="17" version="1065353216">I missed you, sort of.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638708" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good times. Yes. Heh.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638710" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanaton had the sense to pass up this cancerous lot, so they're yours if you want them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638712" id2="17" version="1065353216">This worm is Seferiss. They found him in a Hutt's palace, crushing prisoners' heads for the Hutt's entertainment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638715" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shut up, slave. You don't talk directly to a Lord of the Sith unless he asks it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638717" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shut up, slave. You don't talk directly to a Lord of the Sith unless she asks it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638719" id2="17" version="1065353216">This beady-eyed monstrosity is Argog. Don't know where on a kath hound's backside he's supposed to come from.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638722" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry, what was that? Can't understand a word it says.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638724" id2="17" version="1065353216">This gangly creature is Jaxun. He's no Sith, but he's at least human. No offense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638726" id2="17" version="1065353216">This gangly creature is Jaxun. He's no Sith, but he's at least human.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638728" id2="17" version="1065353216">And this bone-faced one. Well, I can't pronounce whatever gibberish he says he's called. We call him Xalek.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638730" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638732" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't let him fool you. Too wild for his own good. There were two others, but we made the mistake of leaving them alone with Xalek.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638733" id2="17" version="1065353216">I look forward to seeing the results of your trials. I trust you'll be a fair judge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638733" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638734" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one's ever had trouble from me they didn't deserve, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638736" id2="17" version="1065353216">Make sure you push them as hard as you pushed me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638736" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be tough on them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638737" id2="17" version="1065353216">And look how you turned out. Murdered your master. Be careful what you wish for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638739" id2="17" version="1065353216">I caution you against choosing favorites, Harkun. I will check in often.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="638739" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't try to pull anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638740" id2="17" version="1065353216">You may check back as you please. I don't expect it to take too long to chew through this bunch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="638742" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you staring at, wretches? You know your trial. Now, go!</text>
