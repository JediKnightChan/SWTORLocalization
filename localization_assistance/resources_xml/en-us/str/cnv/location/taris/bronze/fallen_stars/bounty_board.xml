Objective: Warhead Retrieval
Contact: Major Teranos
Brief: One of our transports came under fire from Mandalorian raiders just after she broke Taris atmo. Cargo was class seven anti-ship warheads--all ejected safely. Can't say the same for the crew.

The Mandos are already headed for the warheads' landing site--need volunteers to intercept them and signal for pickup when the warheads are secure.

Anyone that gets it done gets double hazard pay. We ID'd the Mando commander as Duran Gorr--the guy takes down Jedi for his day job, so expect major opposition.</text>
