		<text bitflag="1345" id1="626921" id2="17" version="1065353216">We mourn today for Rukil, who brought us out of the undercity and into the Promised Land.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="626923" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have sent scouts throughout Taris and can find no other survivors.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="626925" id2="17" version="1065353216">They cast us out and barred their doors to us, but now we bury our dead in the ashes of their skyscrapers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="626927" id2="17" version="1065353216">As Rukil told us, it is not an easy life. Our children will grow up in a world of spears and bows, not blasters and starships.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="626929" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is my burden to preserve our memories. Once, we were outcasts. Once, we were the Promised Ones. Now we are Taris.</text>
