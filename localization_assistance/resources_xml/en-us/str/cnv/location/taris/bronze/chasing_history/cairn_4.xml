		<text bitflag="1345" id1="626936" id2="17" version="1065353216">Back in the undercity, they reproduced only by infecting us, but now, there are more every day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="626938" id2="17" version="1065353216">We lose people to them, a few every year, but only as meat. The serum the upworlder brought has held true. We do not sicken.</text>
