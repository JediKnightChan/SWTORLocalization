		<text bitflag="3393" id1="120040" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Locust will be transported soon. You've done us a great service.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="120078" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's go!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="120118" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you have in mind?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="120121" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like wishful thinking.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="120124" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got a job to do!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574378" id2="17" version="1065353216">You aren't guards!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574379" id2="17" version="1065353216">You aren't a guard!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574381" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wasn't even sure my message got out... this is perfect. We have to finish the mission. We have to capture the Locust--alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="574382" id2="17" version="1065353216">Count me in.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574383" id2="17" version="1065353216">You obviously have a much better shot at pulling it off than we do, but we'll back you up all the way.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="574385" id2="17" version="1065353216">Uh... what?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574386" id2="17" version="1065353216">We came here to capture the Locust--probably the galaxy's biggest scavenger. He uses a legion of droids to strip whole planets clean.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574388" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stopping the scumbag is important, but the real goal is to get control of those droids. &quot;Advanced&quot; doesn't even start to describe them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="574390" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know about that.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574391" id2="17" version="1065353216">The guy's a monster on a massive scale, but his droids are some of the most advanced in the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574393" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic could repurpose those droids for something productive--maybe even use them to help here on Taris. But only if we can convince the Locust to hand over control.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574394" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll make sure he's not in a position to refuse.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="574396" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're the boss.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574397" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Locust isn't a fool. Back him into a small enough corner, he'll cut a deal. Then everyone wins.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574399" id2="17" version="1065353216">Judging by the explosions, you've made sure the Locust won't be leaving us--all we have to do now is find him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574403" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blast! All right, new plan: we make a diversion, you go for the Locust. He won't go down easy, but if anyone can take him, it's you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="574407" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey! We're over here, you junk-eating sons of slugs!</text>
