		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503520" id2="17" version="1065353216">Things are really turning around out here, all thanks to you!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503521" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did it! Everyone's been talking to the major about the work you've been doing--he's calling off the evacuation!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503523" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll report in with the good news, but you should go back and talk to Strom at the spaceport. He and the governor will want to thank you themselves!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503525" id2="17" version="1065353216">Stay safe, pal.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503528" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can't do this, Major! The governor even sent us more help--look!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503530" id2="17" version="1065353216">The governor has sent us plenty of help already. Volunteers, mercs, even Jedi, and they're all dead or working on it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503532" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not watching the body count go any higher. We're pulling out--ASAP. You want to help, help us load up for evac.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503533" id2="17" version="1065353216">This work is too important to abandon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503533" id2="17" version="1065353216">That isn't an option.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503534" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not your call to make.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503536" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's natural to feel afraid, Major. But don't let that blind you to hope.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503536" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't give in to your fear.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503537" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm no coward, Jedi. I've got lives to save.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503539" id2="17" version="1065353216">No need for evac, Major, sir. We can still win this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503539" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't give up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503540" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll take your five-second tactical appraisal under advisement while we strike camp, Lieutenant.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503542" id2="17" version="1065353216">The governor is paying to get the job finished, not to pack it up and head home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503542" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wasn't hired to help load.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503543" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope she's paying well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503545" id2="17" version="1065353216">Does Governor Saresh know you're pulling out?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503545" id2="17" version="1065353216">What about the governor?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503546" id2="17" version="1065353216">She's not here--we are.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503548" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess we'll have to save this project without your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503548" id2="17" version="1065353216">Running away so soon?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503549" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you want to get yourself eaten or turned into a monster, go right ahead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503551" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anything and anyone that isn't packed when we leave is meat. Your choice.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503553" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'll have to work quickly to get this place safe and running again before the major's evacuation. Maybe then he'll change his mind.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503555" id2="17" version="1065353216">Talk to any of the people here--they'll tell you what needs to be done. I just hope we're not too late.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503556" id2="17" version="1065353216">We won't let all this work go to waste, Vealo.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503556" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503557" id2="17" version="1065353216">Looks like the governor knew what she was doing when she sent you here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503559" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do whatever you have to, Vealo--don't let him take these people out of here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503559" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep the major busy.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503560" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll see what I can do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503562" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should be backing us up, Major, not running away.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="503562" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is ridiculous.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="503563" id2="17" version="1065353216">My orders are to keep these people safe. If you work a miracle and this place ends up being safe again... we'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503565" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="503569" id2="17" version="1065353216">This... isn't a good time.</text>
