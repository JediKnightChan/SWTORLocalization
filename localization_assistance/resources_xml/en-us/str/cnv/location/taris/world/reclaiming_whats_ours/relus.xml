		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622182" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes! After three hundred years, we finally get what's ours!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622183" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's ours, I tell you! It's always been ours!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622184" id2="17" version="1065353216">Brass called me when you left. Wanted to see if your work's as good as your rep.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622185" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is there something else you want me to do?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622185" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why? Is there another job?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622186" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, I doubt he's asking you over for a cup of mudleaf tea.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622188" id2="17" version="1065353216">Captain Childress calls, it usually means something needs fixing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622190" id2="17" version="1065353216">You better believe it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622191" id2="17" version="1065353216">Captain Childress is going to love that attitude.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622193" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's got something for you to do, and he said to pass the word.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622195" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you're interested, go look him up. His office is at HQ, other side of the base. Tell them you're the one who ran off the brat brigade.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622196" id2="17" version="1065353216">No time to chat. I'm on my way to bigger and better.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622196" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm outta here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622197" id2="17" version="1065353216">Must be nice, getting to just pick up and go like that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622199" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyway, if you get a yen to serve the Republic again, look for Captain Childress. He's usually at HQ, other side of the base.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622203" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excellent job! We could smell the smoking metal corpses from here--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622205" id2="17" version="1065353216">I told him that's not really possible--</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622207" id2="17" version="1065353216">So, who are the crooks who set themselves up on our property? Did you drive them off?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622208" id2="17" version="1065353216">They say they've got claim to the land, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622208" id2="17" version="1065353216">Some aliens with a sob story.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622209" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nonsense! The Republic approved us. I'm not wasting time on some fortune hunters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622211" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been three hundred years. Maybe we should talk to them....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622213" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget it. It's ours. Ours at last.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622215" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're gone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622216" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. Please take this for your services.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622218" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't forget our deal.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622219" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622221" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for your help. I think the Republic would have made us wait another three hundred years.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622223" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't wait to see it for myself. I know it's not what it used to be, but maybe we can make it beautiful again....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622225" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, good job. Both on the droids and getting those two off our necks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622227" id2="17" version="1065353216">I took out the droids, but it won't be safe to live there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622227" id2="17" version="1065353216">You shouldn't settle there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622228" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you talking about?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622230" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is it the rakghouls, monsters...? I told you we should have waited until the planet was opened to settlers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622231" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been three hundred years. Give up on Taris and start over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622231" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need to go home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622232" id2="17" version="1065353216">The land is held by the alien who owns this deed. Her claim is better than yours.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622232" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not monsters. The real owners.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622233" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just forget it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622234" id2="17" version="1065353216">No! I am not just going to give up like this!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622236" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've got no choice, Relus. We can't do this on our own.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622238" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your ancestors stole this land. I have the real deed right here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622238" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're the crooks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622239" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look at these papers. The aliens there have as good a claim as yours.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622239" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need to share.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622240" id2="17" version="1065353216">The &quot;alien resettlement&quot; was a valid executive order approved by the Republic. This is our land!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622242" id2="17" version="1065353216">There are alien survivors who kept their claim? I'd have thought they would never want to come back here. I--I studied the history. It wasn't right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622244" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was justified! You can't make us leave because of that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622245" id2="17" version="1065353216">It'll take more than two people to turn this place civilized.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622245" id2="17" version="1065353216">You should work together.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622246" id2="17" version="1065353216">I agree, Relus. This isn't our ancestors' estate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622248" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is a frontier. We'll need to grow food, sew clothes, defend ourselves. Wouldn't it be better to ally with these aliens?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622250" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sew clothes? Hmm... maybe we should just hear them out, see what they're looking for.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622252" id2="17" version="1065353216">We won't turn them away. I know what it's like to want a home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622253" id2="17" version="1065353216">Afraid I can.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622254" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can't do this to us! Our family governed this planet. We owned it!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622256" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's been a long time since that mattered, Relus.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622258" id2="17" version="1065353216">You couldn't face those droids. You don't want to face me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622258" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leave before I get mad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622259" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you threatening me?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622261" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah--they are. And don't make them follow up on it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622262" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, she is. And don't make her prove she can do it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622263" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, I think he is. And I'm pretty sure we should listen.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622265" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll be on the next ship out. It was kind of crazy to think we'd get our dream after three hundred years. That only happens in stories.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622267" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, good job. Both on the droids and getting to the bottom of that mess. Taris politics, huh, who cares about this dump anyway?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622269" id2="17" version="1065353216">Destroy the blasted droids, and I'll show those claim jumpers a thing or two.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622270" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've been waiting weeks! And those things are still swarming our property while you sorry excuses for defenders of the Republic sun yourself on the base.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622272" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is a military operation, sir. This planet hasn't been cleared for civilian occupancy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622274" id2="17" version="1065353216">My brother didn't mean to be insulting. But for three centuries, our family has dreamt of reclaiming our place on Taris. And now to be stopped by those things....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622275" id2="17" version="1065353216">It never looks good to see a Republic soldier refusing aid to one of his own.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622275" id2="17" version="1065353216">The lady has a point.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622276" id2="17" version="1065353216">I got orders I got to follow. No civilian claims 'til the place is secure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622278" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sir! Just following orders, sir.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622280" id2="17" version="1065353216">And it must be nice not having orders to follow. If we chased down every homestead, we wouldn't have the men to hold the base.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622282" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not true, sir! Helping them not get killed--that's aid, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622284" id2="17" version="1065353216">I couldn't help overhearing....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622285" id2="17" version="1065353216">Their old estate's off base, so we got no way to secure it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622287" id2="17" version="1065353216">Taris is our home. We're not going to wait until the army takes its pick of the planet and then throws us the scraps!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622289" id2="17" version="1065353216">Taris is a dangerous place. What are you doing here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622289" id2="17" version="1065353216">The private is right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622290" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our ancestors escaped Taris before the bombardment. They kept everything--deeds, papers, we've even got holo-images of the estate. They always intended us to return.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622292" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can't go chasing civilian claims, justified or not. We've barely got the men to hold the base.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622294" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic validated our records. But some outlaws set up a camp there--they've got security droids all around the perimeter.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622295" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need something dangerous cleared out first?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622295" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can I help?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622296" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not rakghouls or anything. There's someone living there. Sentients.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622298" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't see the problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622299" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's too dangerous. Some kind of outlaws set up a camp there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622301" id2="17" version="1065353216">They've got security droids all around the perimeter. It's a war zone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622303" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is an argument about three-hundred-year-old real estate?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622303" id2="17" version="1065353216">Isn't there something to kill?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622304" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. This is about a Republic citizen, whose home has been invaded by someone with an army of sec-droids, being ignored by the soldiers who should protect him!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622306" id2="17" version="1065353216">We almost got killed entering our own property!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622308" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic will respond to all such claims of hostile non-indigenous life-forms based on strategic value.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622309" id2="17" version="1065353216">After three hundred years, you can't blame someone for thinking it was up for grabs.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622309" id2="17" version="1065353216">Land's been empty a long time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622310" id2="17" version="1065353216">Each generation has passed down these deeds. We always knew we would return to Taris, that we were merely exiles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622312" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Republic won't help us claim it, we're going to have to go back to Alderaan.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622314" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where does their property stand in the expansion plans?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622314" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is the land valuable?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622315" id2="17" version="1065353216">Personal land, sir. It'll be explored once all the public space is secured.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622317" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's what they keep saying. That we can only claim it if we fight those awful droids ourselves. But how?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622319" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unless... could you help us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622320" id2="17" version="1065353216">It is wrong to risk lives for mere property.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622320" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's only land.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622321" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi, I know that you are just kids when you leave to train, but isn't there anywhere that you miss? A place, that you will always feel in your heart, is home?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622323" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is there any way I could move you to help us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622324" id2="17" version="1065353216">After so long, you should not be kept from your home.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622324" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your ties here are strong.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622325" id2="17" version="1065353216">See! Listen to the Jedi. She knows we're the rightful owners.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622327" id2="17" version="1065353216">See! Listen to the Jedi. He knows we're the rightful owners.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622329" id2="17" version="1065353216">Need a hand?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622330" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes! Tell this coward we're the rightful owners, and he has to help us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622332" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want to explore, you look like you can handle it, but it's your choice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622334" id2="17" version="1065353216">Would you really be willing to take such a risk for us?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622335" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your claim seems just.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622335" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll do what I can.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622336" id2="17" version="1065353216">Great. They're all yours, then. You find anything important, you can fill out a form at HQ.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622338" id2="17" version="1065353216">All we need is to get those blasted droids cleared out and find out who's controlling them. I can handle the rest.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622340" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not for free.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622341" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our family was fortunate to escape the bombardment with their fortune intact. Help us reclaim what's ours, and you'll be well rewarded.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622343" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course we'll pay. But no droids. No... whatever's living there. Clear them out, I don't care how.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622347" id2="17" version="1065353216">You heard the man. Take a number.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622347" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can wait. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622348" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not my issue. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622349" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your generosity boggles the mind.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622351" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't they know who I am?</text>
