		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622485" id2="17" version="1065353216">The med droids tell me the boys are responding well to treatment.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622486" id2="17" version="1065353216">Medic!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622488" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry. You're safe now. We'll give you something to help you sleep.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622490" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did good. Myahh says that's all that's left alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622492" id2="17" version="1065353216">If it wasn't for you, every one of those men would have turned rakghoul. I wish I could have been there!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622493" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a fierce battle, but mere beasts cannot stand against the Force.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622493" id2="17" version="1065353216">The righteous always triumph.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622494" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd give my left lung to see one of your kind in action.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622496" id2="17" version="1065353216">I felt their anguish and sought them out in the thick of the rakghoul nests.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622496" id2="17" version="1065353216">They have suffered terribly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622497" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're... lucky to have you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622499" id2="17" version="1065353216">When those boys wake up, I'll tell them a real Jedi Master thought their lives were worth saving.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622501" id2="17" version="1065353216">Smoking ghoul corpses left and right. Tell those scouts they've earned their retirement.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622501" id2="17" version="1065353216">You'd have loved it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622502" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, to be ten years younger....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622504" id2="17" version="1065353216">It'd have been nice to have an extra blaster or two for the good guys.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622504" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wish you could have, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622505" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, you've put my men to shame. Ever consider a career in military service?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622507" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you think those scouts will ever recover?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622507" id2="17" version="1065353216">What happens to them now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622508" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not like they used to be, but they'll get the best care we can give.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622512" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do at that. I thought you'd maybe bring back one, but you've got half the crew here. Take this with my thanks.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622514" id2="17" version="1065353216">Soon as those boys pass quarantine, we'll get them to a real hospital.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622516" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever they need, it's theirs on the Republic's tab. And I'll tell them it's all thanks to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622518" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope you find some of those men. I really do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622521" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, I'd heard you were in our airspace, Lieutenant. Welcome to the last frontier.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622523" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Jedi! Honored to have you. Nice to see some of your order out of the temple and in the world again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622525" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, an intrepid explorer. Good to see there's still folks in the Republic who aren't scared away from our little colony.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622527" id2="17" version="1065353216">Th--they're coming! At the door--the door! We have to get out! Alert the base! Everyone needs to evacuate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622528" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is the base under attack? What's going on?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622528" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who's coming?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622529" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who are you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622530" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't seem terribly concerned.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622530" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this guy for real?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622531" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's Myahh, former first lieutenant of the Endar Rebirth, the first scout vessel sent here to evaluate the possibility of recolonization.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622533" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ship disappeared five years ago. Then three days ago, Myahh comes staggering out of one of the collapsed buildings outside the base.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622535" id2="17" version="1065353216">He lived out there, no weapons but what he made from salvage, holding his own against the rakghouls, all that time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622536" id2="17" version="1065353216">He made a great sacrifice for the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622536" id2="17" version="1065353216">A credit to our soldiers.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622537" id2="17" version="1065353216">Him and others. Those who've lost their lives and those still barely holding onto them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622539" id2="17" version="1065353216">When pressed beyond endurance, a man can find great reserves within.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622539" id2="17" version="1065353216">He has a strong will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622540" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those boys know they're part of the battle to keep the Sith out of our galaxy. They're hard to keep down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622542" id2="17" version="1065353216">His body lives, but his mind has paid the price.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622542" id2="17" version="1065353216">A costly victory.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622543" id2="17" version="1065353216">He has some lucid moments... it's an ugly life left to him now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622545" id2="17" version="1065353216">Okay, I'll stop complaining about the lack of cantinas here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622545" id2="17" version="1065353216">Puts me to shame.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622546" id2="17" version="1065353216">These are good Republic men. They deserve to know that, as long as they're alive, we'll come for them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622548" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's amazing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622549" id2="17" version="1065353216">We breed our boys tough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622551" id2="17" version="1065353216">A fascinating story. I'm sure I'll read how it ends.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622551" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622552" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, if your sympathies are lacking, how about your sense of adventure?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622554" id2="17" version="1065353216">Myahh swears there are other survivors trapped in those ruins, tormented by rakghouls.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622556" id2="17" version="1065353216">Upper brass, sitting on Ord Mantell, say it's too dangerous to send in a rescue unit, so those boys'll die to spare some others the risk of it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622557" id2="17" version="1065353216">Five years... those soldiers should not be left to suffer another day.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622557" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you need someone to help?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622558" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was hoping you'd jump on the chance. I'd have been right there with you back when I had no stripes to wear.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622560" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are the brass right, or are they jumping at shadows?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622560" id2="17" version="1065353216">How dangerous?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622561" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, they've got it right. We go in there, we'll lose three men for every one we save.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622563" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just beyond the base, thickest part of the city collapsed in on itself. Rakghouls everywhere, tunnels so tight there's nowhere to run.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622565" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I say, to deep space with logic! These good Republic boys deserve better! Up for a little adventure?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622566" id2="17" version="1065353216">If it was me, I'd want to know the Republic would come after me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622566" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll do it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622567" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds risky. Any payoff?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622568" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't make the offer official, but I'll personally give you the death benefit for each one you bring back alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622570" id2="17" version="1065353216">Y--you'll help? They're in the ruins. The city... it's all collapsed. Y--you can't see the ghouls, just the yellow eyes... and the smell....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622572" id2="17" version="1065353216">Anyone you find, bring them here. We'll make sure they finish their days in comfort.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622574" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622575" id2="17" version="1065353216">N--no one will come. We'll be out there forever. Forever....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622577" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I were in your shoes, I'd have jumped at the opportunity.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="622578" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your problem. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622579" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was hoping for better. I've heard what you've faced, and you might be one of the few on this wretched hole who could risk it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622581" id2="17" version="1065353216">No man wants to walk into battle knowing he'll die a statistic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="622583" id2="17" version="1065353216">So few soldiers these days who really embrace the frontier....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="755107" id2="17" version="1065353216">There wasn't much fun to miss.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="758350" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can't you do better than that?</text>
