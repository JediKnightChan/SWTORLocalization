		<text bitflag="1345" id1="623363" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is for you, Garthe. I saw you ahead of me there, before the pack cut us off.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="623365" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just want to tell you--you're wrong. The dead do care what happens to them after they die.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="623367" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm one of them now. I hear those monsters, sniffing for me in the dark, and I know I'll be with the dead before anyone comes for us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="623369" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I do care.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="623371" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I'd rather lie here a thousand years, undiscovered, than have some greedy son of a Hutt like you dig me up just to see what I've got that's worth stealing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="623373" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope someone else finds this and makes you pay for your crimes. Like I'm about to pay for mine.</text>
