		<text bitflag="3393" id1="537759" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire will think twice before using our people as bait again.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="537760" id2="17" version="1065353216">I almost didn't believe my eyes when the prisoners made it back.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="537761" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please hurry. Those prisoners don't have much time.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="537763" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those Imperial dogs have no honor!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="537765" id2="17" version="1065353216">A platoon of Twi'lek conscripts was ambushed by Imperial shock troops. Blasted Imps killed half the unit, took the rest prisoner.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="537768" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know how you pulled it off, but you got those men home. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="541309" id2="17" version="1065353216">We received a holomessage from the Imperials' commander, Captain Targis, soon after. No demands. Just executed a prisoner and cut the transmission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="541314" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shouldn't you rescue them?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="541315" id2="17" version="1065353216">Obviously we'd like to bring our men home. But that's exactly what Targis wants.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="541317" id2="17" version="1065353216">Every day Targis executes another prisoner to bait a reaction out of us. We've lost five squads trying to stop him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="541319" id2="17" version="1065353216">Command has decided to cut our losses. Officially, we're abandoning the prisoners. I'm afraid you're their only hope now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="541624" id2="17" version="1065353216">No way. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="541625" id2="17" version="1065353216">I see. I'll contact the soldiers' next of kin.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="541627" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will do what I must.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="541632" id2="17" version="1065353216">Make no mistake--you'll be walking straight into a trap. Watch yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="541635" id2="17" version="1065353216">Even in war, there are rules and codes of conduct. Targis has spat on all of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="542560" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperials have commandeered a Republic outpost. They've got the entire area locked down and they're prepped to fend off any frontal assault.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="543542" id2="17" version="1065353216">How cruel!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="543543" id2="17" version="1065353216">Targis has a reputation here on Hoth. He's a monster, plain and simple.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="544049" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me my part.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="544050" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get as many of our people out as possible.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="544052" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry to intrude, sir, but we've got a crisis brewing and need the Republic's best to handle it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="544054" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pardon, Master Jedi. I'm sure whatever brought you to Hoth is important, but we need your assistance.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="544055" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excuse me, Captain. I'm sure you're busy, but we've got a critical situation that requires your expertise.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="544056" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know what brought you all to Hoth, but I hope it can wait. We've got a crisis that requires your immediate attention.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="544060" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never would have forgiven myself if we'd left those soldiers at the Empire's mercy. Glad we didn't have to.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="544064" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're welcome.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="544065" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's war for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="548914" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll rescue those prisoners.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="548918" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll rescue those prisoners.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="548919" id2="17" version="1065353216">Count me in.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="549856" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not many would face near-certain death. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="551540" id2="17" version="1065353216">It wasn't that hard.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="551541" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperials were tough.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="551542" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can imagine.</text>
