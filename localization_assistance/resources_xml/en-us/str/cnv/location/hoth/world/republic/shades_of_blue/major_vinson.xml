		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554138" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you again. For everything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554141" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our long-range sensors just picked up the explosion inside the geothermal plant. Nice work!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554143" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperials will be furious. I wish I could see their faces....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554145" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our sensors didn't pick up any explosions, did something go wrong?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554146" id2="17" version="1065353216">I chose to stay and fight the Imperial Army.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554146" id2="17" version="1065353216">Everything went fine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554147" id2="17" version="1065353216">I stayed to fight the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554148" id2="17" version="1065353216">You forgot to mention there were innocent colonists in there. Defending them from the Imperial assault was something of a challenge.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554148" id2="17" version="1065353216">You could say that.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554149" id2="17" version="1065353216">You fought the Imperial Army? On your own? Are you serious?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554151" id2="17" version="1065353216">For such a small group of people to take out an entire army... that's astonishing!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554153" id2="17" version="1065353216">The stories I've heard about Jedi don't do you justice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554155" id2="17" version="1065353216">Havoc Squad may just put the rest of us out of a job, Captain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554157" id2="17" version="1065353216">Remind me never to cross a spacer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554159" id2="17" version="1065353216">For one person to take on an entire army and live to tell the tale is... remarkable. I've never seen anything like it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554161" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. You've probably just saved the lives of half the soldiers on Hoth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554162" id2="17" version="1065353216">If everything here is secure, Major, I'm probably needed elsewhere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554162" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554163" id2="17" version="1065353216">A simple task, really.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554164" id2="17" version="1065353216">Typical day for Havoc Squad.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554165" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was a piece of cake.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554166" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554169" id2="17" version="1065353216">There are a lot of people on Hoth who could probably use your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554171" id2="17" version="1065353216">Listen, I know this is asking a lot, but we've lost contact with Lieutenant Kieral at Senth Outpost....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554173" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know what's happened there, but I suspect they're in trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554175" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know, you might want to go see Admiral Revald in the ship graveyard.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554177" id2="17" version="1065353216">He's in charge of the biggest, most critical mission on Hoth. If there's anywhere in the sector you should be, I think that's it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554179" id2="17" version="1065353216">The last transmission we got from Aurek Base said they were under attack. We haven't heard anything since.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554181" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's a good chance the base has been lost. You might want to look for survivors.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554183" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I wish you a safe journey, wherever your travels take you next.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554185" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not sure how much time we have before the Empire seizes the power station. Good luck out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554186" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, sir!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554188" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is from Imperial Intelligence. It looks like... it's a strategic assessment of the Ortolan geothermal power station. Maps, avenues of attack....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554190" id2="17" version="1065353216">The geothermal station is currently held by the White Maw. If the Empire takes it from them... we're in trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554191" id2="17" version="1065353216">Exactly what will happen if the Empire's plan succeeds?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554191" id2="17" version="1065353216">How much trouble?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554192" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who or what are the White Maw?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554192" id2="17" version="1065353216">The White Maw?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554193" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pirates. Hoth is crawling with them. They took the geothermal station from the Ortolan colonists who built it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554195" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not fond of trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554196" id2="17" version="1065353216">It will be a disaster for this outpost as well as the entire Republic operation on Hoth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554198" id2="17" version="1065353216">Capturing the power station would give the Empire a completely self-sufficient fortified base on our doorstep.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554200" id2="17" version="1065353216">They'd be able to launch attacks from there with impunity. We'd never drive them out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554201" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you suggest we do to stop them?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554201" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you have a plan?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554202" id2="17" version="1065353216">So the datadisc says, &quot;You're all going to die.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554202" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's bad news.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554203" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then you'll have to defend it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554204" id2="17" version="1065353216">So we'll capture it, first.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554205" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can handle this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554206" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't have the manpower to defend that power station. Once you leave, the Empire could just take it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554208" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's only one thing to do: Destroy it before they get there. Take these remote charges.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554209" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's too bad. We could certainly use it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554209" id2="17" version="1065353216">What a pity.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554210" id2="17" version="1065353216">One explosion, coming up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554211" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blow it to smithereens? Is this really the best plan you could come up with?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554211" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not the most subtle approach.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554212" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not ideal, but we can't let the power station fall into Imperial hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554215" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire got to your Chiss defector, but the datadisc was still on his body.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554216" id2="17" version="1065353216">The target was dead on arrival, but the datadisc appears to be intact.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554217" id2="17" version="1065353216">Turns out the blue guy was telling the truth: The Empire killed him. I found the datadisc, at least.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554218" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's just as well. I'm not sure the men really wanted a Chiss hanging around here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554220" id2="17" version="1065353216">The data disc is the critical thing. Let's get a look at it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554222" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lieutenant! We need this decrypted.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554224" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't get yourself killed over a Chiss. Bring him back if you can, but don't take any chances.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554225" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, this is a surprise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554227" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome to Outpost Cresh. We're understaffed, far from everything, and basically, the outpost the galaxy forgot.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554229" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry to say, you've just arrived in the least important outpost in the sector, Master Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554231" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good to see you, Captain. Normally, I'd say Havoc Squad would be better off closer to the front.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554233" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've got good timing. Normally, I wouldn't expect anyone to come to this outpost, let alone a spacer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554235" id2="17" version="1065353216">Welcome to Outpost Cresh. Usually, this is the least important place in the sector.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554237" id2="17" version="1065353216">But we just got a break that could make this the hottest spot on Hoth: We got a message from one of the Chiss.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554238" id2="17" version="1065353216">They contacted you? There's likely some trickery involved.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554238" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you certain it's real?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554239" id2="17" version="1065353216">I agree with you completely. Ordinarily, I wouldn't trust it, but....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554241" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's time they realized how much we out-class them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554241" id2="17" version="1065353216">To surrender?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554242" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not exactly, Captain.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554244" id2="17" version="1065353216">Finally get that dinner invitation?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554244" id2="17" version="1065353216">What sort of message?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554245" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why is that important?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554246" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Chiss are the Empire's best allies here on Hoth. This message is a phenomenal break of luck for us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554248" id2="17" version="1065353216">Aren't they allied with the Empire? What did they want?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554248" id2="17" version="1065353216">An Imperial blue guy called?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554249" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here, I'll let the transmission speak for itself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554251" id2="17" version="1065353216">Republic outpost, do you copy? I'm under heavy fire, and I haven't got much time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554253" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've stolen a datadisc of time-sensitive information from Imperial Intelligence. I am offering this to you in exchange for sanctuary.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554255" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire is hunting me; I don't know how long I can hold out. Send help, and I'll give you whatever you want!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554256" id2="17" version="1065353216">You wouldn't be showing me this if you thought it was just an Imperial trick.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554256" id2="17" version="1065353216">You believe him, don't you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554257" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think that Chiss would never choose to appear weak, even to bait a trap. He has to be desperate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554259" id2="17" version="1065353216">This could be trouble.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554260" id2="17" version="1065353216">So do I. But if it's true, we haven't got much time before he and his datadisc are gone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554262" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's no way a Chiss would actually betray the Empire. This has to be a trick.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554262" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think he's lying.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554263" id2="17" version="1065353216">If it's true, though, we're about to lose a potential ally and a weapon against the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554265" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we're going to act, we have to act fast.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554266" id2="17" version="1065353216">If he's telling the truth, it's too great an opportunity to pass up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554266" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll check it out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554267" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. Outpost Cresh can barely defend itself; we don't have people to send on a rescue mission.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554269" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, Master Jedi. This mission is way beyond anything my people could manage.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554271" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was hoping you'd say that, Captain. Havoc Squad is the only outfit in the army that could pull this mission off.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554273" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm relieved to hear you say that. I don't have anyone who could pull this off; you're our best hope.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554275" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. There aren't many people in the galaxy who'd go out on a limb for this guy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554277" id2="17" version="1065353216">The signal came from a crashed dropship not far from here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554279" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be careful. Bring the Chiss back if you can, but if it does look like a trap... get out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554281" id2="17" version="1065353216">You want me to go rescue him, I take it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554281" id2="17" version="1065353216">By, &quot;we,&quot; you mean me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554282" id2="17" version="1065353216">We don't have the manpower. If anyone is going to save him, it's got to be you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="554284" id2="17" version="1065353216">Too risky. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554285" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand. I wish I could change your mind, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554287" id2="17" version="1065353216">Things are a bit busy right now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="554290" id2="17" version="1065353216">Plant the charges in the station's energy transformers, then get out. We'll blow the place sky-high.</text>
