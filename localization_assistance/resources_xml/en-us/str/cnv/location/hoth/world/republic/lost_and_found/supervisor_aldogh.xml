		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486756" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one is in here! Go away!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486757" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't be afraid. I'm not with the Empire; I came to help you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486757" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't hurt you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486758" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't need any help! I'm... fine. I'm just fine!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486760" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got to ask: Have you ever actually convinced anyone with that line, or are you just that optimistic?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486760" id2="17" version="1065353216">You really think that'll work?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486761" id2="17" version="1065353216">...Try to get people's attention, nobody listens to me. Try to avoid people, suddenly I'm the guy everyone wants to see....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486763" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just come out here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486764" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those who report Republic sympathizers will be rewarded. Those who harbor the anarchists in our midst will be punished. Which would you rather be?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486766" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's too late. You can't rescue me now, anyway.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486767" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm a Jedi. I assure you, you'll be safe.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486767" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course I can.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486768" id2="17" version="1065353216">You can't hide in there forever. Sooner or later you'll have to come out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486768" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be reasonable.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486769" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've got the best soldier in the Republic out here. This is the safest place on Hoth.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486769" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come out, it's okay.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486770" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come on out, you're probably not going to get to see another hero up close, you know.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486770" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're missing my heroics.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486771" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't know there was some kind of time limit on daring rescues.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486771" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why is it too late?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486772" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can you walk?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486773" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please, I can't come out. Not after what I've done.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486775" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic stole this planet from your people. The Empire will give it back to you, if you only let us.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486777" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... I talked! Korl Torin tortured me, and I talked! I told him about the mines!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486779" id2="17" version="1065353216">He led the attack on Aurek Base, and I gave him information that can kill everyone left there.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486781" id2="17" version="1065353216">The mines under our facility are filled with an explosive gas. Korl Torin has already gone to divert it under Aurek Base.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486782" id2="17" version="1065353216">When did you tell him this? Maybe we can still stop him if we hurry.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486782" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's still time.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486783" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not long ago. But... there's nothing we can do.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486785" id2="17" version="1065353216">Once he's destroyed the base, he'll send you off to be a slave in the Unknown Regions.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486785" id2="17" version="1065353216">That was a stupid thing to do.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486786" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know. That's why I can't come out.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486788" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not going to happen.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486789" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one can stop him. He's got an army of Imperial shock troops. Everyone on Hoth will die, and it's my fault.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486791" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're all alone out here. The Senate doesn't care what happens to the Outer Rim. Surrender, and you can leave Hoth alive.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486793" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know I don't deserve mercy. Call Laskin and warn him. Tell him what I've done, just... let me go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486794" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go, but the Empire hasn't won yet. There's still time to save your people, if you're willing to try.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486794" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486795" id2="17" version="1065353216">You really think so?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486797" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe you're right. I could get my people... we could go for help!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486799" id2="17" version="1065353216">If there are any Republic soldiers within fifty kilometers, we'll bring them here, I promise!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="486800" id2="17" version="1065353216">After what you've done, you deserve to rot in there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="486800" id2="17" version="1065353216">Forget it. [Seal him in.]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="486801" id2="17" version="1065353216">No!</text>
