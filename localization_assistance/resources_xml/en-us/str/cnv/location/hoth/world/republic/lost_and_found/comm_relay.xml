		<text bitflag="1345" id1="667808" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sir, I've picked up an urgent transmission from the Crescent Canyon Facility. Putting it through now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667810" id2="17" version="1065353216">Aurek Base, do you read me? The Empire is here!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="667813" id2="17" version="1065353216">How far away are they? Why didn't your long-range sensors detect an Imperial attack?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667813" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where is that signal from?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667814" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're in the geothermal plant in Crescent Canyon. We don't have any sensors near there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667816" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those poor people....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667817" id2="17" version="1065353216">That doesn't look good.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667818" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's going to get messy.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667819" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those people have been kicked around by everyone who's come here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="667821" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll admit, I didn't expect to find civilians on Hoth. Why would anyone choose to live here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667821" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are they doing here?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667822" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Ortolans were the first people on Hoth. They came here as colonists.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667824" id2="17" version="1065353216">Their facility at Crescent Canyon has the best cold-weather technology on Hoth. Technology that's now in Imperial hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="667825" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll go see what can be done to save these colonists.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667825" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll go there now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667826" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="667828" id2="17" version="1065353216">That transmission doesn't make me think they're strong allies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667828" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do we really need them?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667829" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're not great soldiers, but they know Hoth and can travel in the cold to reach our more distant outposts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667831" id2="17" version="1065353216">How do I help them, exactly?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667832" id2="17" version="1065353216">Try to reach Supervisor Aldogh. He's in charge of the facility. Contact me once you've found him. Good luck.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667835" id2="17" version="1065353216">It worked! When I got a transmission from the Talz, I thought it might've been a fluke. This is fantastic!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="667837" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lieutenant, we're receiving messages on all channels. Cresh Outpost is reporting in now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667839" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're not alone out here anymore. This is going to be fabulous for morale.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="667840" id2="17" version="1065353216">With communications back online, you should be able to call for backup. Or at least new orders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667840" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can you call for help now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667841" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad to hear it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="667842" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is there anything happening out there that I should know about?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="667842" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any news from the outposts?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667847" id2="17" version="1065353216">If the Ortolans are really in slave collars, you'll need to get the keys from the Imperials.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="667849" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're putting us in slave collars! You've got to send help! We--no, he's coming!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="755453" id2="17" version="1065353216">They're killing anyone who doesn't surrender! You've got to send help! We--no, he's coming!</text>
