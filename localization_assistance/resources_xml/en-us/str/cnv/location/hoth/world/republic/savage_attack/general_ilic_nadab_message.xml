So here we are. Last-resort scenarios. Hoth is going down the refresher, and word is you're the only useful asset we've ever had visit this chunk of ice. We need you back here and we need it to be soon. We're losing people by the day, and even through an encrypted terminal I'm not going to say more. Hurry. I'll meet you planetside at Aurek Base.
