		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525033" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are my fingers meant to be this color?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="525034" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi! We've been waiting for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672642" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do us proud out there, Jedi!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672644" id2="17" version="1065353216">We wanted to thank you before we left. We owe you our lives... and I probably owe you my career.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672646" id2="17" version="1065353216">We wanted to say thanks before we left. We'd never have made it through without your help!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672648" id2="17" version="1065353216">You even put Valon on a leash. That's Jedi training for you!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672649" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just did what was best for everyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672649" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was nothing, really.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672650" id2="17" version="1065353216">After what Valon did to you and your homeworlds, it's fitting to make him serve you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672650" id2="17" version="1065353216">It seemed appropriate.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672651" id2="17" version="1065353216">Valon sought destruction and enslavement. Now he's found it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672651" id2="17" version="1065353216">He deserved this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672652" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was worth it all to see Valon stuffed in a convict shuttle.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="672654" id2="17" version="1065353216">Here. From us. Don't need our equipment now that we're leaving.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672655" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was an honor to work alongside you. Go well.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672655" id2="17" version="1065353216">Look after yourselves.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672656" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672657" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this all you can spare? I did save your lives, after all....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672657" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's it?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672658" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'd love to give you twice as much, but we used all our gear fighting Valon.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672660" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, forgot. The LT got a call, he's gone up to your starship to make a report. He said he'd meet you there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672662" id2="17" version="1065353216">The LT got called up to your starship to make his report. He said to meet you up there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672664" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever anyone says, you're one of us now, Jedi. Best of luck.</text>
