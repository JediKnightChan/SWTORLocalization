		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672832" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's far enough, Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672834" id2="17" version="1065353216">The pirate Valon is ours. And so is that armor he borrowed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672835" id2="17" version="1065353216">I heard that Valon took the armor from under the Empire's nose.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672835" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't you mean &quot;stole&quot;?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672836" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a loan. The armor made him the perfect weapon to attack the Republic and your little coalition.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672838" id2="17" version="1065353216">Unfortunately, Valon's becoming a nuisance. He needs to be put down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672840" id2="17" version="1065353216">That armor is a threat to the safety of the Republic. It cannot fall into your hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672840" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't let you have it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672841" id2="17" version="1065353216">I intend to see Valon receive a just punishment for his crimes. Don't interfere.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="672841" id2="17" version="1065353216">Valon's mine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672842" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care about some Jedi notion of justice. I have my orders.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="672844" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're taking that armor back if we have to rip it off Valon's body. You're not in any position to stop us.</text>
