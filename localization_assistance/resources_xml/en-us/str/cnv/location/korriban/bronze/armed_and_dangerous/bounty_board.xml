The tomb of Tulak Hord is now haunted by one of the lost. Lord Sundar entered the tomb long ago and never returned. Madness has turned him both savage and bloodthirsty. His presence defiles the sacred stone around him.

Acolytes who truly wish to prove their worth will rid the tomb of this taint. Deliver Lord Sundar's signet ring here, and you will be rewarded.</text>
