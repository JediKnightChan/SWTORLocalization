		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658196" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes? Can I help you with something?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658198" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hold on. Are those the research supplies we were after? I'd given up on them days ago!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658200" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have no idea how much I appreciate this. Some of these chemicals take months to manufacture--not much use to you, but vital to us.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658202" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you. You're welcome to use some of our equipment as compensation--I'll make sure to mention you to the commander.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658204" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry--I'll get to you as soon as I can. I'm trying to solve a supply problem.</text>
