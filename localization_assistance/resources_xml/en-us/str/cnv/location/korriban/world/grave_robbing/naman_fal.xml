		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658430" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have done enough. Go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658431" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't belong here. You stand before the Chamber of the Dark Council, and this floor is off-limits to all who are not Lords of the Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658433" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you are not on official business, you will leave now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658434" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've come with news about your son.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658434" id2="17" version="1065353216">I must tell you something.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658435" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wow, this looks like a nice place to hang out all day. How do I land your job?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658435" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nice gig you've got.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658436" id2="17" version="1065353216">You kill more people than you ever knew were alive, and when you are done, you... I sense... you are carrying my son's remains?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658437" id2="17" version="1065353216">Or what?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658438" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are either insane or merely a fool. I suggest you leave.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658439" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please, I'm sorry. I have word of your son.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658439" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wait, let's try again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658440" id2="17" version="1065353216">So that is the smell you carry. It is said he went into the tomb of Naga Sadow to prove himself and was killed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658442" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right. See, but I... have this body....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658442" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know how to put this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658443" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right. See, but I... have this body....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658443" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know how to put this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658444" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right, I see, but, uh, I have this body....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658444" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know how to put this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658445" id2="17" version="1065353216">I see. Those are the remains of my son.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658447" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was such a weak boy. He shames me in death as he shamed me in life.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658449" id2="17" version="1065353216">When I heard of his death, I could not leave my post; honor forbade it. Still, I would like to know what happened in there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658450" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course. Ask away, my lord.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658450" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, sir.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658451" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your deference does you credit.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658452" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me what happens around here, first. Must be pretty crazy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658452" id2="17" version="1065353216">You share, then I will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658453" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about what happens around here, first. Must be pretty crazy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658453" id2="17" version="1065353216">You share, then I will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658454" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about what happens around here, first. Must be pretty crazy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658454" id2="17" version="1065353216">You share, then I will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658455" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is where the Dark Council meets, where Sith politics play out, where the Emperor issues his decrees and where lives are destroyed with the flick of a wrist. Satisfied?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658456" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's it worth to you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658457" id2="17" version="1065353216">If that is what you desire, then yes, I will give you something for your efforts.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658459" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now tell me: Where did you find his body? Did my pathetic son even make it past the first steps? In the end... was he Sith?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658460" id2="17" version="1065353216">He died right at the entrance of the tomb. Pathetic indeed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658460" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, he failed hard.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658461" id2="17" version="1065353216">Of course he did! Every moment of his life existed only to mock me. I will keep his bones to remind me of my shame and to focus my anger!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658463" id2="17" version="1065353216">But you have done me a service and such deeds should be repaid. You have brought me pain and torment. I will return the favor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658465" id2="17" version="1065353216">My son sought a relic I placed in the base of a cracked statue deep in the tomb. This crystal will release it. Now go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658467" id2="17" version="1065353216">He died valiantly, deep in the tombs. He was nearly Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658467" id2="17" version="1065353216">[Lie] He almost made it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658468" id2="17" version="1065353216">He died well? I suppose my son had more of me in his heart than I had ever considered possible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658470" id2="17" version="1065353216">With this news, you have brought me a peace I didn't think possible. Thank you. I will have him buried in honor.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658472" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take this small token of my appreciation and go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="658474" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're mean. [Leave]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658475" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get out of my sight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="658477" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't belong on this floor.</text>
