		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660251" id2="17" version="1065353216">We can speak later. Let's stick to the task at hand.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660252" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha! Defeated! Defeated!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660254" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why did you not come for me, Tulak? Why have you allowed your servant to be reduced to this?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660256" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine, little one. In my great weakness, you have defeated me, so I must serve you--this is the law that binds me. But you are not my master.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="660257" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am your master. Get used to it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660257" id2="17" version="1065353216">Denial won't change anything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="660258" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine. Then let's go.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660258" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's leave this place.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660259" id2="17" version="1065353216">You will obey.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660260" id2="17" version="1065353216">As you say, little one.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660262" id2="17" version="1065353216">But someday I will regain my strength.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660268" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha! All the world conspires to mock me! Haha!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660270" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tulak Hord! I waited for you. I did everything you said! And this is what you send me?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660272" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha! Fate is cruel to me, little one. But not as cruel as it is to you. You have made a terrible mistake.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="660273" id2="17" version="1065353216">These were the instructions Zash gave me. I am to free you and you will take me to the map in the final chamber of the tomb.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660273" id2="17" version="1065353216">No, this is right.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660274" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't resist.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="660275" id2="17" version="1065353216">You don't sound exactly sane.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660275" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're crazy.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660276" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. Ha! No, little one. I am perfectly sane. The world mocks me, and I laugh with it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660278" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am Khem Val, servant of Tulak Hord, who was called Lord of Hate, Master of the Gathering Darkness, Dark Lord of the Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660280" id2="17" version="1065353216">Together, Tulak Hord and I devoured our enemies at the battles of Yn and Chabosh and brought the entire Dromund system to its knees. And now I await his return.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="660281" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hate to be the one to break it to you, but Tulak Hord is dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660281" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't know how to say it...</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660282" id2="17" version="1065353216">Dead? My lord, why didn't you come for me? I would have died with you--no, I would have slain death itself....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660284" id2="17" version="1065353216">What?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660285" id2="17" version="1065353216">No--what time have I awakened in--that my master's exploits are no longer remembered by the Sith? Tulak, my lord, are you so long gone as to be forgotten?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660287" id2="17" version="1065353216">As for you, you should not have come here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="660289" id2="17" version="1065353216">Shut up. You're my slave now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="660289" id2="17" version="1065353216">Silence, monster.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660290" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. You have awakened me, but I do not answer to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660292" id2="17" version="1065353216">You have made a grave mistake waking me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660294" id2="17" version="1065353216">For I hunger--and I will devour you!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660299" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I had not seen it, I would not have believed it was true. My master is dead, and all his works are buried in sand.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="660300" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are not my master.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="982244" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ahhhh</text>
