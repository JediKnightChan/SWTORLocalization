Taris's water supply is a hotbed of parasites, disease and pollutants. Waterborne diseases kill hundreds of settlers a day. This glorious trend must continue. 

The Republic knows a quenched army is an entrenched army. Without clean drinking water, they will never gain a foothold on Taris. That is why they move to attack the planet's pollution!

Republic droids have begun rebuilding an old filtration plant. If restored, the plant will purify enough water to fuel Taris's resettlement.

General Farvin calls on your services. Disable the filtration plant, destroy the droid repair team and Taris's water will poison would-be settlers for centuries to come.</text>
