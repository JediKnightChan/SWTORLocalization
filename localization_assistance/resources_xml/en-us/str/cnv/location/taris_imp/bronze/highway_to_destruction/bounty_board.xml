The Republic rats have fled underground. An entire battalion rallies in Gadon's Superhighway, a massive swoop track beneath your very feet.

The scum unite under Taren Vor, a Jedi commander descended from old Taris. He aims to build a subterranean supply network. If successful, the Republic will infest the planet for decades.

Stop this mockery of Taris's ruin, and your valor will be repaid. Crush the Republic's highway, bury their army and annihilate the Jedi leader.</text>
