The old Tarisian government lives. Approximately three centuries ago, the leaders froze themselves in carbonite within Transport Station 5.

Intercepted transmissions confirm the Republic's elite Ember Squad was dispatched to recover the frozen leaders. If revived, their knowledge will accelerate Taris's reconstruction by three thousand percent.

Darth Gravus orders immediate action. Stop Ember Squad's thawing mission and eliminate the frozen Tarisian leaders. Hazard fee payable on completion.</text>
