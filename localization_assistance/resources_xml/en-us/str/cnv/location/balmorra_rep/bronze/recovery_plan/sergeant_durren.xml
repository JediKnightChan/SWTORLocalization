		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296520" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sergeant Durren. I heard your team tracks Imperial ships. These transponders might help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296521" id2="17" version="1065353216">These are straight out of Imperial aircraft. We haven't even been able to get near the wrecks.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296523" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll start decoding these immediately. I don't know how you found them, but thanks.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296525" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can't brief you, sorry. Need to keep an eye out for Imperial aircraft.</text>
