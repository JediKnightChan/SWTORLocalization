		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297211" id2="17" version="1065353216">With the Imperials out of the way, we can start shipping supplies to our outposts again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297214" id2="17" version="1065353216">I took out those Imperials and recovered your supplies.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297215" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nice work. Wish we had a few more of you Jedi types here on Balmorra to help us out.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297217" id2="17" version="1065353216">Much appreciated. It's good to know the Republic has our back again.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297219" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have to admit, I wasn't sure about you. Seemed a little shifty--no offense. But you came through when it counted.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297221" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperials = gone // Supply routes = open // E5-D5 = ready for action</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297223" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry, little fella. We'll get the supply trains rolling again soon enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297225" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thanks for your help. The resistance is in your debt.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297229" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me know when you've taken out those Imperials and recovered our supplies.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297233" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sheed = not there // Sheed = doesn't understand // Sheed = doesn't care</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297235" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know I care! But there's nothing I can do.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297237" id2="17" version="1065353216">E5-D5 = located Imperials // Sheed = assemble team // Team = go after Imperials</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297239" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need more than a location. We need troops. I don't have anyone to send!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297241" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sheed = not trying hard enough // E5-D5 = find someone else to help</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297242" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your droid seems upset.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297243" id2="17" version="1065353216">Imperials hit one of our supply trains.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297245" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can I be of assistance?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297246" id2="17" version="1065353216">Right now, we need all the help we can get. Imperials hit one of our supply trains.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297248" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you going to let this bucket-of-bolts talk to you like that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297248" id2="17" version="1065353216">Droids need to show respect!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297249" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know he's not mad at me. It's those Imperial scum. Hit one of our supply trains.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297251" id2="17" version="1065353216">E5-D5 = only survivor // Imperials = took supplies // E5-D5 = tracked Imperials</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297253" id2="17" version="1065353216">We know where they're at, but I can't spare anyone to go after them. The resistance is running thin on good people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297254" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those Imperials are no match for a Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297254" id2="17" version="1065353216">Leave this to me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297255" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're probably right about that. Good to know you're on our side.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297257" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Jedi Order won't turn its back on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297257" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not in this alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297258" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic is here to support the resistance. Just tell us what you need.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297258" id2="17" version="1065353216">Havoc has plenty to spare.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297259" id2="17" version="1065353216">Folks in the resistance have gotten used to being left high and dry by your kind. Nice to know you're here for us this time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297261" id2="17" version="1065353216">Every time someone says there's nobody available, seems like they expect me to step up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297261" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is that a hint?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297262" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sheed = too proud // Sheed = ask nice man for help</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297264" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sheed = too proud // Sheed = ask nice lady for help</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297266" id2="17" version="1065353216">The droid's right. We're desperate. If you help us out with this, I'll make sure it's worth your while.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297268" id2="17" version="1065353216">You could hire me.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297269" id2="17" version="1065353216">The resistance needs those supplies back. If you can recover some of them, I'll make sure you get a fair cut.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297271" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't send anyone else out until I know the supply route is safe. We can't afford the losses.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297273" id2="17" version="1065353216">Report back to me after you take out the Imperial patrol so I know the road is clear.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297275" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't care. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297276" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'll figure something out on our own. We always do.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297280" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't really feel like talking right now.</text>
