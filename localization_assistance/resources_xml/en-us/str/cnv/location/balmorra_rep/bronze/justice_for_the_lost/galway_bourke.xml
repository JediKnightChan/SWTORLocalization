		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296600" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not going to die alone, Mindi. I promise you that.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296601" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me guess....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296603" id2="17" version="1065353216">Republic had something more important for you to do than worry about my dead family.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296605" id2="17" version="1065353216">You decided that &quot;revenge is wrong,&quot; and you're going to help me hug some puppies instead.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296607" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Didn't want to face Sobrik alone. You're sorry, but you gave a good try.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296609" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you don't know who sold out my poor Mindi, I don't want to hear it!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296610" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is the list of all Imperial informants on Balmorra.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296610" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have the names.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296611" id2="17" version="1065353216">These are the informants. Plus, the Empire's short a few goons to follow up on anything they gave.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296611" id2="17" version="1065353216">I have the names.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296612" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ha! I hope you made those tyrants scream.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296614" id2="17" version="1065353216">If that's what you're going to be like, maybe I'll just keep this list of informants to myself....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296614" id2="17" version="1065353216">Watch your tone.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296615" id2="17" version="1065353216">Y--you have it? You did it? Oh, Mindi, we're gonna teach those traitors a lesson....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296617" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wish I'd met you a month ago, friend. Could have saved me and Balmorra a whole lot of hurt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296618" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got the information. Do you have the cash?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296618" id2="17" version="1065353216">What are you paying?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296619" id2="17" version="1065353216">What? You went through all that, and now you want credits?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296621" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fine! Take everything I have! I got no one to save it for, anyway....</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296623" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry. I'm not expecting much from you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296624" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me ask you something. The Republic trying to make a real difference this time? Or they still willing to sell us out?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296626" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah, I'm talking to you. You lot are big with the Republic, yeah?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296628" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's right, Master Jedi. The robes and the lightsaber don't get you automatic love here no more.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296630" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's right. Some of us don't forgive so quick when you soldier boys leave us to the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296632" id2="17" version="1065353216">Or am I wrong? You do work for the Republic, yeah?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296634" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ach! I shouldn't jump on you. It's not like we haven't been just as rotten to ourselves....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296635" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds like there's a story here....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296635" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are you getting at something?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296636" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know it's been hard.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296637" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't patronize me.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296639" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is none of my business.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296640" id2="17" version="1065353216">I got nothing to be ashamed of. I'm not the one who turned my neighbors over to the Empire!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296642" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been doing the right thing, what the Republic told us. Hold the line, fight the fight. Led a few attacks myself.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296644" id2="17" version="1065353216">But when my wife and kids get kidnapped? Sold to the Empire by my own neighbors? Who's there then?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296645" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm there. Where's your family being held?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296645" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll help you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296646" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296647" id2="17" version="1065353216">I tried to rescue them, but I couldn't get near before....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296649" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why aren't you rescuing them?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296650" id2="17" version="1065353216">My family is dead. Executed as traitors.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296652" id2="17" version="1065353216">The only thing I can do for them now is find which traitors sold them out, and make sure they suffer.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296653" id2="17" version="1065353216">Making them suffer won't bring back your family.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296653" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revenge won't help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296654" id2="17" version="1065353216">But finding out who they are... making sure they can't do it again....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296656" id2="17" version="1065353216">And after that? Will their deaths fill the emptiness inside you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296656" id2="17" version="1065353216">Revenge won't help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296657" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not just revenge, Master Jedi. It's keeping this from happening to every Balmorran who cares about freedom.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296659" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know Jedi are peaceable and all, but these people, they're helping the Empire terrorize us!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296661" id2="17" version="1065353216">I just want someone to get into Imperial records in Sobrik before they delete them. Find out the names of their informants. So they don't get away with their crimes.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296662" id2="17" version="1065353216">People should know there's a price for collaborating with the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296662" id2="17" version="1065353216">They must be taught a lesson.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296663" id2="17" version="1065353216">And it's higher than what the Empire will pay them!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296665" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm pretty good at ferreting out information if I've got something to go on.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296665" id2="17" version="1065353216">You know where to look?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296666" id2="17" version="1065353216">I know where the information is; I just don't have the guns to get it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296668" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can do it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296669" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmph. Maybe you're a better lot than I gave you credit for.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296671" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hmph. Maybe you're a better sort than I gave you credit for.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296673" id2="17" version="1065353216">Empire's got computers in Sobrik, got the names of every informant on file. If you get those to me, I'll make sure they're exposed.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296675" id2="17" version="1065353216">And I bet you can put some hurt on a few Imperial &quot;extradition teams&quot; in the process....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296677" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't do it. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296678" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is it too much to ask for some justice?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296680" id2="17" version="1065353216">Republic abandoned us once. Why should we trust them now?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="489338" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Didn't want to face the Empire alone. You're sorry, but you gave a good try.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="489341" id2="17" version="1065353216">Empire's got the names of every informant on file at a camp nearby. If you get those to me, I'll make sure they're exposed.</text>
