		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296983" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imps are in for a big surprise when they finally evacuate this planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296986" id2="17" version="1065353216">The trackers are in place.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296987" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excellent. I knew I made the right choice when I tagged you for this mission. I have an eye for spotting talent.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296989" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's probably why they gave me this mission. Nobody else could have pulled it off.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296990" id2="17" version="1065353216">My pleasure.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="296991" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't break your arm patting yourself on the back. All you did was ask me for help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296991" id2="17" version="1065353216">I did all the work.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296992" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry, you'll get the credit you're due.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="296994" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's talk compensation.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296995" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wasn't going to try and stiff you, if that's what you're worried about.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296997" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll make sure my superiors understand this was a joint effort when I file my report.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="296999" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe we'll get a chance to work together again sometime.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297003" id2="17" version="1065353216">Plant those trackers on everything you find at the Empire's construction site.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297007" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pleased to meet you. Agent Jaylla Noh, Strategic Information Service.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297009" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let me ask you a question. Are you dedicated--truly dedicated--to seeing the Republic achieve ultimate victory here on Balmorra?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297010" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not leaving until every last enemy force is driven off this world.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297010" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's why I'm here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297011" id2="17" version="1065353216">Surely you know my order is one of your staunchest allies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297011" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Jedi serve the Republic.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297012" id2="17" version="1065353216">No retreat, no surrender.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297012" id2="17" version="1065353216">Those are my orders.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297013" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good. We're on the same page. But true victory is more than just reclaiming the planet.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297015" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd rather see the Republic on top than the Imperials. Not getting myself killed to make it happen, though.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297015" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've got a vested interest.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297016" id2="17" version="1065353216">Close enough, I suppose. But victory isn't just winning Balmorra.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297018" id2="17" version="1065353216">Obviously I want the Republic to win. What are you really getting at?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297018" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this a trick?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297019" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't think I like your tone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297019" id2="17" version="1065353216">You doubt me?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297020" id2="17" version="1065353216">Relax. This isn't about you. Not yet, anyway. First, I need to see if you have vision.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297022" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we drive the Imperials off Balmorra, they'll retreat to one of their own worlds. But that isn't victory.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297024" id2="17" version="1065353216">They'll rebuild their strength, and eventually they'll attack us again. It's a pointless cycle I intend to stop once and for all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297025" id2="17" version="1065353216">Balmorra is just one world, but it's a key to defeating the Empire once and for all.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297025" id2="17" version="1065353216">Eventually we'll break them.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297026" id2="17" version="1065353216">True, but we can accelerate the process. Instead of being reactive, we can be aggressive.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297028" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a bold statement.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297029" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you say you intend to stop it, you really mean I'm going to do all the work, don't you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297029" id2="17" version="1065353216">And you need my help, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297030" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wouldn't say you're doing all the work. After all, I had to come up with the plan. I'm quite proud of it, actually.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297032" id2="17" version="1065353216">If someone can plant tracking devices on key Imperial vehicles and equipment, we can use it to follow them when they retreat.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297034" id2="17" version="1065353216">Wherever they run to, we can send reinforcements to hit them again before they regroup. We'll crush them once and for all!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297035" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297036" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm glad you agree. There's a short list of people who can pull this off. I think you just might be on that list.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="297038" id2="17" version="1065353216">You do realize planting the tracking devices means fighting into the heart of an Imperial camp, right?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297038" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not that simple.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297039" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's where you come in. I've seen the reports. Facing overwhelming odds is kind of your specialty. This should be no problem for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297041" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imps are digging some kind of tunnel nearby. Place a tracker on everything you can find there: vehicles, terminals, even transport crates.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297043" id2="17" version="1065353216">Remember: Driving the Imperials off Balmorra is only the beginning. We also have to make sure they never come back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="297045" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pass. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297046" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you were someone who understood the importance of planning ahead. Guess I was wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="297050" id2="17" version="1065353216">No time to chat. Too many pots on the stove.</text>
