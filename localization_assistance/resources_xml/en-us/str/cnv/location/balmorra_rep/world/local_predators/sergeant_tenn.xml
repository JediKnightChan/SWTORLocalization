		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493797" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've started the cleanup. Soon there won't be any trace of those bugs. I can't thank you enough.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493800" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did it! The Colicoids have pulled back.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493802" id2="17" version="1065353216">We could tell the moment the queen died; the fight just went right out of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493803" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm just glad I was able to help.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493803" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good to hear it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493804" id2="17" version="1065353216">We wouldn't have made it without you. With the bugs taken care of, I think we'll finally be okay.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493806" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounded like morale was pretty bad before. What's it like now?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493806" id2="17" version="1065353216">How are your people doing?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493807" id2="17" version="1065353216">Better. We're packing up and switching gears--we've got an Empire to fight.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493809" id2="17" version="1065353216">There aren't enough languages in the galaxy to say thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493810" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't call on me again.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493811" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't worry. We can take care of ourselves from here on out. Thanks for everything.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493813" id2="17" version="1065353216">Two more people were attacked this morning. You've got to do something about those bugs!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493818" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't expect them to send a Jedi our way. I won't complain, though; the Colicoids are tearing us apart.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493820" id2="17" version="1065353216">Captain, I'm sure glad to see you. The Colicoids are tearing us apart.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493822" id2="17" version="1065353216">Over here! I was expecting soldiers, but I guess the Colicoids are tearing up comms, too.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493824" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's about time Command sent someone down here. The Colicoids are tearing us apart.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493826" id2="17" version="1065353216">You think, &quot;they're just big bugs,&quot; but they're smart. Perfect, living weapons--I've never faced anything like them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493828" id2="17" version="1065353216">I called for reinforcements after they grabbed Captain Langstrom. I'm just glad you finally made it through.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493829" id2="17" version="1065353216">Start at the beginning. What are you talking about?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493829" id2="17" version="1065353216">What's going on, Sergeant?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493830" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Colicoids were designed to kill everything that moves. It's all they do--kill and eat. Morale's in tatters.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493832" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where's your commanding officer, Sergeant?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493832" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who's in charge here?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493833" id2="17" version="1065353216">I guess that's me. After the Colicoids got Cap-- I've tried to hold what's left of the unit together, but morale's in shambles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493835" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tosh shot himself in the foot rather than face them again. I've got more deserters than actives, now.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493837" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not your reinforcements.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="493838" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yeah? Well... you're here now. Please, you've got to help us.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="493840" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd like to get my hands on the scientists who created these things. Danstrom wasn't even dead yet--the Colicoids pulled him down and started eating.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493841" id2="17" version="1065353216">Still yourself. Fear lays a path best not traveled.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493841" id2="17" version="1065353216">Calm down.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493842" id2="17" version="1065353216">You need to keep calm, Sergeant. Your soldiers are counting on you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493842" id2="17" version="1065353216">Get ahold of yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your heart's going to pop if you don't relax a little.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493843" id2="17" version="1065353216">Calm down, soldier.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493844" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll try. It's just--the attacks started so suddenly. No one was ready.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493846" id2="17" version="1065353216">You said &quot;created.&quot; Who would create something like that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493846" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tell me about the Colicoids.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="493847" id2="17" version="1065353216">The corporations, I heard. Each trying to make the best weapon. Each bug's a killing machine.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493849" id2="17" version="1065353216">This matters to me how?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493850" id2="17" version="1065353216">Giant bugs are eating innocent people! Surely that means something to you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493852" id2="17" version="1065353216">We thought they were bad in Bugtown. There must be another hive, though; there's more bugs than ever.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493854" id2="17" version="1065353216">Please, you've got to find that hive and clear it out. We can't withstand another assault.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493856" id2="17" version="1065353216">Can you spare any men to help?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493856" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any chance of some backup?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493857" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't even have enough to protect the supply lines. I can't spare anyone else.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493859" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you find the hive, you've got to hunt down and kill the queen, otherwise she'll just start all over.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493863" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not my fight. [Refuse quest]</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493864" id2="17" version="1065353216">You won't be so flippant when the bugs start eating someone you care about.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493866" id2="17" version="1065353216">I had a report of civilians gone missing. Keep your eyes peeled while you're out there.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493868" id2="17" version="1065353216">How many soldiers can you spare?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493868" id2="17" version="1065353216">Any chance of some backup?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Just tell me where the hive is, and I'll handle it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493869" id2="17" version="1065353216">Bugs? I'll take care of them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493870" id2="17" version="1065353216">We lost two full patrols in the caves near here. That could be where their hive is hidden.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="764194" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm not afraid of the bugs.</text>
