		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480864" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep up the good work!</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480867" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've done enough for us. Colonel Hunt is waiting for you at the Upper Sundari Outpost--and don't forget that droid data.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480868" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperials aren't content with just attacking here. They've launched a major assault to retake the Balmorran Arms Factory.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480869" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've seen the weapons and droids Balmorran Arms produces. We can't let it fall back into the Empire's hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480869" id2="17" version="1065353216">That factory can't be lost!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480870" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe the Imperial attack here was meant to keep our attention away from Balmorran Arms.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480870" id2="17" version="1065353216">Was all this a distraction?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480871" id2="17" version="1065353216">If that's true... if they murdered innocent people as a ruse--I wish you'd killed every one of them!</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480873" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's not really my problem.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480874" id2="17" version="1065353216">I suppose Commander Madine thought he could count on you for help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480876" id2="17" version="1065353216">Commander Madine asked you to head to the Upper Sundari Outpost as fast as you can. Colonel Hunt's the officer in charge.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480878" id2="17" version="1065353216">Before you go... I have something for the Republic. A gesture of friendship, from the resistance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480879" id2="17" version="1065353216">What kind of gesture?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480880" id2="17" version="1065353216">I never say &quot;no&quot; to presents.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480881" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic doesn't need gifts. We know we can count on the resistance.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480881" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's kind, but unnecessary.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480882" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, we wouldn't be much of an ally if we didn't share intelligence.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480884" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hurry this up.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480885" id2="17" version="1065353216">We captured and rewired several Imperial probe droids. They've been spying on Imperial forces in the Sundari Flatlands.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480887" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you download the data those probe droids have gathered for us, I bet Colonel Hunt could put it to good use.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480888" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you, Wixx. I'll see that he gets it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480888" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sure he will.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480889" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll go and get the data.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480890" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you'd been quicker to share, this intelligence could have prevented the Imperial attack.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480890" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why not give it to us earlier?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480891" id2="17" version="1065353216">Our technician was killed in the field. We couldn't retrieve the droids remotely. And then the Empire came.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480893" id2="17" version="1065353216">Be careful. I hope Colonel Hunt appreciates the help he's getting.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480897" id2="17" version="1065353216">I honestly thought Gabe should have sent a team twice as big. But you really came through.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480899" id2="17" version="1065353216">I honestly thought your reputation was exaggerated. But you really came through.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480901" id2="17" version="1065353216">Some in the outpost are saying that the Imperials would never have attacked if... if people like you hadn't provoked them.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480903" id2="17" version="1065353216">But even if that's true.. you were here when we needed help. Thank you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480904" id2="17" version="1065353216">What the Empire has done to Balmorra is wrong. But letting its actions go unpunished would have been a greater evil.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480904" id2="17" version="1065353216">Jedi always oppose darkness.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480905" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic military never backs down against the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480905" id2="17" version="1065353216">Fighting Imperials is my job.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480906" id2="17" version="1065353216">Glad you see it that way. I didn't much fancy being chased off by an angry mob.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480906" id2="17" version="1065353216">Well, that's a relief.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480907" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're welcome.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480908" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was a trivial task.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480909" id2="17" version="1065353216">Payment, please.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480910" id2="17" version="1065353216">But I thought... okay. I'll see what I can do.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480912" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wish I could leave it at &quot;thank you,&quot; but Commander Madine just contacted me--he's head of the Republic military forces on Balmorra.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480916" id2="17" version="1065353216">Talk to Rond Berrin and Daven Tam. They'd be grateful for your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480919" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope you know how to use those weapons. We've never needed friends more than now.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480921" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire's killed so many. We're still finding wounded, and people are missing... I don't even know where my cousin's family is.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480923" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperial soldiers were ordered to attack undefended, helpless civilians. There are no military targets here!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480924" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nothing ever excuses killing innocent people.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480924" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is horrific.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480925" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's accepted that the Empire will attack military targets. But this....</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480925" id2="17" version="1065353216">Appalling. Even war has rules.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480926" id2="17" version="1065353216">Blasted Imperials. They're called non-combatants for a reason.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480926" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Empire's crossed the line.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480927" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's terrible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480928" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought the Imperial leadership here was falling apart. Who's leading these forces?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480928" id2="17" version="1065353216">Who gave that order?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480929" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Sith who took command. The Imperials call him Lord Tharsis.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480931" id2="17" version="1065353216">What else would you expect from Imperials?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480931" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the Empire for you.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480932" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Imperial soldiers are being led by a Sith--Lord Tharsis, they call him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480934" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lord Tharsis ordered the attack on Moraine Territory to punish us for rebelling--and for everything the Empire's suffered. If he can't break us, he'll just kill everything we care about.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480935" id2="17" version="1065353216">It sounds like the Imperial forces would scatter without him. He should be our target.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480935" id2="17" version="1065353216">Let's focus on Tharsis, then.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480936" id2="17" version="1065353216">No one else will suffer. I promise.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480936" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not on my watch.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480937" id2="17" version="1065353216">Or, we kill him first.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480938" id2="17" version="1065353216">We gathered intelligence on Lord Tharsis--troop movements and such. But the teams who went to fight him never came back.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480940" id2="17" version="1065353216">Honestly, you'd do more good by helping people here. Too many could die while we're focused on one man, even if he is a Sith.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="480941" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Lord Tharsis isn't stopped, these people won't be safe no matter what happens.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480941" id2="17" version="1065353216">We should still handle him.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480942" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't stop you. But please don't do anything rash.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480944" id2="17" version="1065353216">That makes sense.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480945" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then tell me what you need.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480946" id2="17" version="1065353216">Several civilians say the Empire's brought in Mandalorian mercenaries--they're ruthless, worse than the Imperials. Rond Berrin's looking into it.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480948" id2="17" version="1065353216">And the Empire's been rounding up people from the local villages. They're... it's a long story. But Captain Daven Tam's been trying to help them.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480949" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll talk to them both.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480950" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'd better get to work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="480951" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll try not to get bored.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480952" id2="17" version="1065353216">We'd appreciate anything you can do. Let me know if you're successful.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="480956" id2="17" version="1065353216">If you see anyone who needs help, please just grab a medkit.</text>
