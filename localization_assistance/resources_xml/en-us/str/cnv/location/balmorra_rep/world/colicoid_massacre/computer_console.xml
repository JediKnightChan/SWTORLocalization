		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493886" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, hello. My name is--was--Arick Tamso. My colleagues and I were looking for a way to pacify the Colicoids. We failed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493888" id2="17" version="1065353216">Doctor Tabo... tampered with the suppressive implants. The Colicoids became more feral... more cunning. They broke free, killing everyone.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493890" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then, Doctor Tabo sealed the rest of us in and fled. I don't have long. The Republic must know about that maniac.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493892" id2="17" version="1065353216">The implants... they'll prove his treachery. Whoever hears this, please... extract the Colicoid implants and take them to my brother, Pol, at Sundari Outpost....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493894" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, I'm afraid I'll have to interrupt him here. Don't worry, the rest is just sentimental drivel.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493896" id2="17" version="1065353216">I am Doctor Tabo, the aforementioned &quot;maniac&quot;--though it's a rather specious claim.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493897" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're the one responsible for all these deaths.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493897" id2="17" version="1065353216">You did this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493898" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, I may have taken a few... experimental liberties, but those are hardly my claw marks covering the bodies.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493900" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're not still in this base, are you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493900" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where are you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493901" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh, no, I'm someplace thankfully free of Colicoids. I've simply been keeping an eye on this facility.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493903" id2="17" version="1065353216">Awfully convenient that you survived when everyone else was killed.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493903" id2="17" version="1065353216">How are you still alive?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493904" id2="17" version="1065353216">Survival is nothing if not competitive. I merely put as many bodies between the Colicoids and myself as possible.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493906" id2="17" version="1065353216">I should explain. No doubt you've seen the havoc the Colicoids are capable of.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493908" id2="17" version="1065353216">Instead of pacifying them as the Republic wanted, I sought to harness this savagery and turn it against the Empire.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493909" id2="17" version="1065353216">You sabotaged these people's work.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493909" id2="17" version="1065353216">You won't get away with this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493910" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;Sabotage&quot; is such a strong word. I merely took initiative... with lamentable results.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493912" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's the kind of scheme the Empire would come up with.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493912" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're worse than Imperials.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493913" id2="17" version="1065353216">Morality won't win battles.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493915" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic would never condone those underhanded tactics.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493915" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493916" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Republic is shortsighted. If a blaster shot one of their men, they'd deactivate it.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493918" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wasn't born yesterday. You knew what you were doing was wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493918" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't play innocent.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493919" id2="17" version="1065353216">I knew discretion was called for, yes, but &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;misunderstood&quot; are hardly the same thing.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493921" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's obvious that something went wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493921" id2="17" version="1065353216">Clearly, you messed up.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493922" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, the savagery was certainly there, but the control was somewhat... lacking. An unfortunate miscalculation, but a correctable one.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493924" id2="17" version="1065353216">We need every bit of help we can get against the Empire. This could be big.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493924" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sounds interesting.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493925" id2="17" version="1065353216">My thoughts exactly.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493927" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm aware that the late Arick Tamso asked you to turn me in. Avenging his death will do nothing to give it meaning.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493929" id2="17" version="1065353216">And yet the carnage that took place here might be justified... if I can finish my research.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493931" id2="17" version="1065353216">I need all evidence of my involvement erased so I may continue my trials elsewhere. Exterminate these Colicoids--and I'll pay you handsomely.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493932" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm going to turn you in, not help you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493932" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm going to expose you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493933" id2="17" version="1065353216">I see. Well, it's no matter. Those Colicoids will tear you to pieces, anyway.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493937" id2="17" version="1065353216">Okay, I'll help you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493938" id2="17" version="1065353216">Excellent choice. I'll be waiting at Sundari Outpost with your reward. Don't delay.</text>
