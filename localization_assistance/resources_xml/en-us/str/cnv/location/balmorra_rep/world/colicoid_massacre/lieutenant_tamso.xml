		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493950" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's a shame my brother had to die for us to recognize Doctor Tabo for the lunatic he really was.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493952" id2="17" version="1065353216">Lieutenant Tamso? I have some information concerning your brother....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493955" id2="17" version="1065353216">So... it was sabotage. I should've known Tabo was lying.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493957" id2="17" version="1065353216">I warned Arick it was dangerous to meddle with the Colicoids. Guess I should've warned him about Doctor Tabo, instead.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493958" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is there enough evidence to convict him?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493958" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is this sufficient proof?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493959" id2="17" version="1065353216">If what you say is true, there should be proof that these implants were tampered with. That alone should prove his guilt.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493961" id2="17" version="1065353216">He deserved justice.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="493962" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm through here.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493963" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes, you've done more than enough already.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493965" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for bringing me this evidence. I'll get these implants to our technicians, and we'll have Doctor Tabo locked up in no time.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="493969" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's time we did something about those Colicoids. I say vaporize the lot of them.</text>
