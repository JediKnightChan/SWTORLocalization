		<text bitflag="3393" id1="459517" id2="17" version="1065353216">Looks like you're still in one piece. I guess Natho's virus must have worked. Makes me feel better about asking for more.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="459519" id2="17" version="1065353216">Natho's heard that a new batch of those same probe droids are ready to ship out to Imperial forces across the galaxy.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="459521" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've hit the Empire on Balmorra, but we could strike a real blow if we sabotaged those droids before they ship.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="459522" id2="17" version="1065353216">I like this plan.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="459523" id2="17" version="1065353216">Natho's idea, not mine. Guess he's not all crazy.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="459525" id2="17" version="1065353216">A real blow, huh?</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="459526" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Okara Droid Factory is controlled by the Empire. You'll have your pick of Imperials shooting at you.</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="459528" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's a big 'if.'</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="459529" id2="17" version="1065353216">Natho's plan has worked so far. Might as well finish.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="459531" id2="17" version="1065353216">Head for the assembly line inside the Okara Droid Factory. You'll find the probe droid shipments nearby.</text>
		<text bitflag="3393" id1="459533" id2="17" version="1065353216">Natho will be waiting for you at a resistance camp nearby. Ought to be tickled pink if this works.</text>
