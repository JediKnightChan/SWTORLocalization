		<text bitflag="1345" id1="603452" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't mean to be rude, but I'd rather not talk for long. My daughter is very sick, and I'm all she has since my husband died.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="603453" id2="17" version="1065353216">I found a holorecording on your husband's body. He said these Manka cat teeth would help your daughter.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="603457" id2="17" version="1065353216">Are those Manka cat teeth? You brought these for my daughter? These will cure her....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="603459" id2="17" version="1065353216">I did what your husband couldn't. These Manka cat teeth are for your daughter.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="603462" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... I'm overwhelmed. I don't know what to say.</text>

		<text bitflag="1345" id1="603466" id2="17" version="1065353216">I... you should be rewarded for this. Yes, uh... wait, I know. Yes, you should have this.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="603468" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was my husband's. It served him well, and now that you have saved my daughter's life... I hope it serves you well also.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="603470" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you so much. I've... I've got to tell the doctor right away so that he can make Rusa's medicine.</text>
