		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91971" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tython, huh? Amazing....</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91972" id2="17" version="1065353216">The temple is amazing. You'll see.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91975" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hey, Padawan! You must be the one Master Yuon mentioned, must be!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91977" id2="17" version="1065353216">If we weren't Jedi, I would say I could tell because you are as cute as described. But we are Jedi, so I will say nothing of the sort.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91979" id2="17" version="1065353216">Isn't Tython amazing? Scary too, don't get me wrong, but wow. I mean, look at this place!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91981" id2="17" version="1065353216">Sorry. Babbling.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91983" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Yuon said to remind you that she says a Jedi needs to learn martial skills and said that I should say you should.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91984" id2="17" version="1065353216">And who will train me in these martial skills?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="91984" id2="17" version="1065353216">There somewhere I should go?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91985" id2="17" version="1065353216">Thank you for passing along the message. Was there anything else?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="91985" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will that be all?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91986" id2="17" version="1065353216">Oh right, right. Sorry!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91988" id2="17" version="1065353216">Not really the calm and collected Padawan ideal, are you?</text>
		<text bitflag="1360" id1="91988" id2="17" version="1065353216">You're silly for a Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91989" id2="17" version="1065353216">First week. Just found I was Force sensitive. How crazy is that?</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91991" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go see Master Wettle in the temple. Doesn't look like much, but he'll show you stuff you wouldn't believe. Good luck--may the Force be with you!</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91993" id2="17" version="1065353216">Did I have something to tell you? Hmm, maybe not.</text>
