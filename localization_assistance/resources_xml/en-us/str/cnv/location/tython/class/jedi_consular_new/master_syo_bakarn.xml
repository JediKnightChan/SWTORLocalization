		<text bitflag="1345" id1="90937" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go on to Coruscant. Yuon needs you.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90938" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuon is resting comfortably, for now. It seems she's suffering some kind of illness.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90940" id2="17" version="1065353216">I can't lie to you. Her condition is grave.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90941" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is Master Yuon going to be alright?</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90941" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will she die?</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="90942" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuon thought sickness would take her.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90944" id2="17" version="1065353216">We have some of the finest healers in the galaxy, can't we treat her?</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90944" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then let's help her.</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="90945" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuon tried to heal, Herald. Was no sickness she knew.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90947" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Yuon had been acting strangely....</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90947" id2="17" version="1065353216">I knew something was wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="90948" id2="17" version="1065353216">She did best to hide sickness, Herald.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90950" id2="17" version="1065353216">You knew Yuon was ill? And didn't inform us?</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="90952" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is not for me to tell secrets. Was her wish to train one last hunter. I understood.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90953" id2="17" version="1065353216">Now I see why she was so devoted to my training.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90953" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was her last student?</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90954" id2="17" version="1065353216">We must act.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90955" id2="17" version="1065353216">I thought you were friends. We could have helped her.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90955" id2="17" version="1065353216">And now she's dying!</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="90956" id2="17" version="1065353216">I gave oath, Herald.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90958" id2="17" version="1065353216">We're sending Yuon to Coruscant. Our researchers there have been recovering artifacts from the first Jedi Temple; they may have something to cure Yuon.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90960" id2="17" version="1065353216">Take a shuttle, and join Yuon on Coruscant. She will need your help.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90961" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'll do everything I can to make her well.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90961" id2="17" version="1065353216">I won't let her die.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90962" id2="17" version="1065353216">I will do so.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90963" id2="17" version="1065353216">More experienced Jedi should take care of her.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90963" id2="17" version="1065353216">How can I be any help?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90964" id2="17" version="1065353216">You are--were--her student. And you've proved how valuable your help can be.</text>
		<text bitflag="7489" id1="90966" id2="17" version="1065353216">Where Herald goes, I go also. Is Scorekeeper's wish.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90968" id2="17" version="1065353216">Meantime, assure Yuon we will be studying your discoveries about Rajivari. Some of the claims his apprentices recorded... bear investigation.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90970" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you reach Coruscant, go to our embassy in the Senate tower, and find a researcher called Attros Finn. He'll be expecting you.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90972" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good luck. To you both. And may the Force be with you.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90980" id2="17" version="1065353216">We've been waiting for you, Padawan. You've already met Master Jaric; this is Master Satele Shan.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90982" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've been treating Nalen Raloch. The Pilgrims who carried him here told us of your battle. Remarkable.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90983" id2="17" version="1065353216">I would have brought a peaceful solution if I could, Master.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90983" id2="17" version="1065353216">I regret it came to violence.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90984" id2="17" version="1065353216">Peace is the ideal, Padawan, but there's no shame in defending yourself.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90986" id2="17" version="1065353216">How bad are his injuries, Master Satele? I wasn't sure he would survive.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90986" id2="17" version="1065353216">Will Nalen live?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90987" id2="17" version="1065353216">He will, though it will be a long recovery.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90989" id2="17" version="1065353216">I always do good work.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90990" id2="17" version="1065353216">You've begun well, Padawan. How you proceed remains to be seen.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90992" id2="17" version="1065353216">Kalikori village sent word of the battle at the Forge, and Nalen Raloch's death. He could not be saved, then?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90993" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nalen Raloch's reputation will survive. That will benefit Kalikori village more.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90993" id2="17" version="1065353216">I saved his legacy.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90994" id2="17" version="1065353216">I see you've thought this over.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90996" id2="17" version="1065353216">Circumstances forced my hand.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90997" id2="17" version="1065353216">You protected innocent lives. We cannot ask for more.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="90999" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nalen planned to destroy the Forge, then wage war against us. We're safer with him dead.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="90999" id2="17" version="1065353216">He was far too dangerous.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91000" id2="17" version="1065353216">Clearly you believe that. But don't let the urgency of the moment blind you to other paths.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91002" id2="17" version="1065353216">The deaths of the Pilgrims is problematic. It may take years to regain the village's trust--decades, even....</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91004" id2="17" version="1065353216">It seems we have much to learn about the villagers. Perhaps we should rethink our position....</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91006" id2="17" version="1065353216">Enough, enough. Padawan--the Fount of Rajivari. You actually set foot there? Please, tell me everything!</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91007" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Rajivari himself spoke to me. What was left of him.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91007" id2="17" version="1065353216">I met Rajivari.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91008" id2="17" version="1065353216">You saw a Force apparition? Of Rajivari? This is extraordinary!</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91010" id2="17" version="1065353216">Its relics and technology have survived. Enough to keep our historians busy for years.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91010" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's mostly intact.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91011" id2="17" version="1065353216">You must record every detail for me--everything!</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91013" id2="17" version="1065353216">There was nothing to get excited over.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91013" id2="17" version="1065353216">It was only a ruin.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91014" id2="17" version="1065353216">Don't be ridiculous, it must have been a wonder! So much to see, to learn--</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91016" id2="17" version="1065353216">It seems you may have been right, Yuon. I... apologize. To you, and your Padawan.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91018" id2="17" version="1065353216">No longer a Padawan. She carries a lightsaber; she has proven herself. I have only one last question before her training's complete.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91020" id2="17" version="1065353216">No longer a Padawan. He carries a lightsaber; he has proven himself. I have only one last question before his training's complete.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91022" id2="17" version="1065353216">At the moment, Nalen Raloch is resting in a kolto tank. When he's well, what should become of him?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91023" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nalen proved he has great strength in the Force. Maybe he has a future with us.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91023" id2="17" version="1065353216">Train him as a Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91024" id2="17" version="1065353216">And bring reconciliation between us and the villagers--a sound idea.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91026" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nalen fought and suffered for his village. If you judge it safe, let him go home.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91026" id2="17" version="1065353216">Release him to his people.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91027" id2="17" version="1065353216">Compassion. No Jedi should be without it.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91029" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nalen is still a threat. He should remain in your custody, indefinitely.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91029" id2="17" version="1065353216">Keep him prisoner.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91030" id2="17" version="1065353216">Concern for the safety of others. Very prudent.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91032" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nalen Raloch was corrupted and destroyed. You walked a similar path. Why did you not fall?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91033" id2="17" version="1065353216">If I'd had an entire village to protect, Master Satele, perhaps I would have crossed some lines.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91033" id2="17" version="1065353216">I didn't have Nalen's burdens.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91034" id2="17" version="1065353216">Very honest. Always be mindful of your motives.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91036" id2="17" version="1065353216">I had a Master who cared about my progress, and Qyzen as an ally. Nalen had no one.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91036" id2="17" version="1065353216">Others helped me.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91037" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes. No Jedi can stand against darkness alone.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91039" id2="17" version="1065353216">Nalen let himself be consumed by knowledge. I wouldn't allow such weakness.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91039" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm stronger than that.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91040" id2="17" version="1065353216">Humility will be a hard-won lesson for you, I see. But, I'm satisfied.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91042" id2="17" version="1065353216">We judge you ready to accept your place as a Jedi. Yuon, if you would?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91046" id2="17" version="1065353216">Before this Council, I take from you the title of Padawan. I name you a full Jedi of our order. Honor the past. Work... for the future.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91048" id2="17" version="1065353216">May the Force be always with you. You've... done so well, my student. I'm....</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91051" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Yuon?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91052" id2="17" version="1065353216">Come away. Yuon? Can you hear me?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91056" id2="17" version="1065353216">Hello again, Padawan. I'm glad to see you well.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91058" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Syo Bakarn. I was there to greet you when you first arrived.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91059" id2="17" version="1065353216">Being greeted by a member of the Council is hard to forget, Master Syo.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91059" id2="17" version="1065353216">I remember.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91060" id2="17" version="1065353216">Interesting. Protocol was never a big focus of Yuon's curriculum.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91062" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you need me for something, Master Syo?</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91062" id2="17" version="1065353216">What can I do for you?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91063" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least she has a sense of responsibility.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91065" id2="17" version="1065353216">At least he has a sense of responsibility.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91067" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm sorry. My work for Master Yuon has been keeping me preoccupied.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91067" id2="17" version="1065353216">I don't remember you.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91068" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yes. Yuon mentioned your &quot;expeditions.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91070" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is Master Jaric Kaedan, another of the Jedi Council. Yuon told us about Nalen Raloch, the Pilgrim seeking Rajivari's secrets.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91072" id2="17" version="1065353216">She also claimed the Force is &quot;guiding&quot; your training. This isn't unknown, but....</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91073" id2="17" version="1065353216">So the Force influencing a Padawan's training is quite rare.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91073" id2="17" version="1065353216">But it is unusual.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91074" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuon seems convinced. But trusting blindly in the Force isn't the Jedi way. Good judgment and discipline must temper that trust.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91076" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Yuon mentioned this, but she didn't go into details.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91076" id2="17" version="1065353216">What did Yuon say, exactly?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91077" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuon thinks encountering Nalen, and finding a few relics, proves you're meant to find this Fount of Rajivari. It's baseless.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91079" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps the Force needed the right person for this task.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91079" id2="17" version="1065353216">Maybe I'm just special.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91080" id2="17" version="1065353216">There, Syo. Where there's blind certainty, there's arrogance. Yuon should know better.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91082" id2="17" version="1065353216">First she welcomes that Trandoshan into the temple, now this? She's getting more unorthodox by the day.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91084" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you make of Yuon's claim, Padawan?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91085" id2="17" version="1065353216">I trust in Master Yuon's wisdom.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91085" id2="17" version="1065353216">I support her beliefs.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91086" id2="17" version="1065353216">Master Yuon is my teacher. It isn't my place to question her.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91086" id2="17" version="1065353216">It's not for me to judge.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91087" id2="17" version="1065353216">Indeed not. That's the Council's responsibility.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91089" id2="17" version="1065353216">I respect Master Yuon's beliefs, but I don't share them. My path is my own.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91089" id2="17" version="1065353216">I think she's wrong.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91090" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Council has agreed to accept Yuon's opinion. For now. But I am concerned about the dangers this path is leading you through.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91092" id2="17" version="1065353216">Finding the Fount of Rajivari before Nalen Raloch does is important. But so is your safety, Padawan. Be mindful.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91094" id2="17" version="1065353216">Go carefully, Padawan. Yuon is placing a lot of faith in you.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91097" id2="17" version="1065353216">Ah, Padawan. I heard your shuttle arriving. I'm Master Syo Bakarn, of the Jedi Council. Welcome to Tython.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91099" id2="17" version="1065353216">This is the ancestral home of our order, where the Jedi first came to be. And where our most promising Padawans complete their training.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91100" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm surprised a member of the Jedi Council would come to meet me.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91100" id2="17" version="1065353216">Do you greet all new arrivals?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91101" id2="17" version="1065353216">I wanted to meet the student who's caused such a stir.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91103" id2="17" version="1065353216">The chance to see where the first Jedi walked, train where they trained--it's quite an honor.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91103" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm excited to be here.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91104" id2="17" version="1065353216">So eager. You and your new Master should get along nicely.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91106" id2="17" version="1065353216">With respect, Master Syo, I'd rather be training than talking.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91106" id2="17" version="1065353216">Then I'd like to get started.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91107" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your instructors tell me that even in childhood, you had a remarkable connection to the Force. We haven't seen such power in decades.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91109" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your instructors say your understanding of Jedi lore and philosophy is unmatched. Such a powerful mind could make you a great Jedi.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91111" id2="17" version="1065353216">Your instructors speak of your visions, that you walked the galaxy to find our order. We are honored to have you.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91113" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was... hoping your new Master would be here. Yuon left her dig site and is returning to Tython specifically to train you.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91114" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is Master Yuon an archaeologist?</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91114" id2="17" version="1065353216">A dig site?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91115" id2="17" version="1065353216">In a way. As you become her Padawan, never forget your initial training, nor the Jedi Code:</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91117" id2="17" version="1065353216">It sounds like Master Yuon's putting a lot of faith in me. We haven't even met.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91117" id2="17" version="1065353216">I hope I'm worthy.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91118" id2="17" version="1065353216">Trust in your initial training. And never forget the Jedi Code:</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91120" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Master Yuon's so keen to train me, you'd think she'd show up on time.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91120" id2="17" version="1065353216">And yet she's late.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91121" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Jedi Master's time is rarely her own. Patience. Recall the Jedi Code:</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91123" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;There is no emotion, there is peace. There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.&quot;</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91125" id2="17" version="1065353216">&quot;There is no passion, there is serenity. There is no chaos, there is harmony. There is no death, there is the Force.&quot; This is....</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91127" id2="17" version="1065353216">Yuon. I was beginning to worry.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91129" id2="17" version="1065353216">So you've arrived safely, my Padawan. I'm sorry I can't greet you properly, but we already have a crisis on our hands.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91130" id2="17" version="1065353216">I'm at your service, Master.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91130" id2="17" version="1065353216">I stand ready.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91131" id2="17" version="1065353216">This crisis is the reason you were delayed.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91131" id2="17" version="1065353216">That's why you were late.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91132" id2="17" version="1065353216">Precisely.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91134" id2="17" version="1065353216">I want to know what's happening.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91134" id2="17" version="1065353216">What do you mean?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91135" id2="17" version="1065353216">Tython is a treasure trove of ancient Jedi relics. Recently, our researchers uncovered several &quot;teaching holograms,&quot; but they've not been fully studied.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91137" id2="17" version="1065353216">These holograms may be records of the founders of the Jedi Order--they're absolutely irreplaceable.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91139" id2="17" version="1065353216">But, a large group of Flesh Raiders has begun rampaging through that region. Those priceless holograms are in danger.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91140" id2="17" version="1065353216">I've never heard of Flesh Raiders before.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91140" id2="17" version="1065353216">Flesh Raiders?</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91141" id2="17" version="1065353216">Is there a way to protect the holograms?</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91141" id2="17" version="1065353216">Perhaps we can save them.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91142" id2="17" version="1065353216">Someone must slip past the Flesh Raiders to recover these holograms' projectors. I intend this to be the first task of your training.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91144" id2="17" version="1065353216">Whatever these &quot;Flesh Raiders&quot; are, they can't hurt something without physical form.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91144" id2="17" version="1065353216">Why? They're holograms.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91145" id2="17" version="1065353216">The Flesh Raiders are Tython's natives. Savage cannibals who destroy everything in their path.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91147" id2="17" version="1065353216">Including the holograms' projectors. Combat teams are pushing the Flesh Raiders back, but retrieving the holograms is the first task of your training.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91149" id2="17" version="1065353216">No. Yuon, you can't risk a Padawan against Flesh Raiders, even for such important artifacts.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91151" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Padawan who was stronger in the Force at four years old, than I was at fifteen? Gifted students need greater challenges.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91152" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Padawan who's studied every combat treatise of the last two centuries. Gifted students need greater challenges.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91153" id2="17" version="1065353216">A Padawan who wandered alone for years--before learning Jedi techniques. Gifted students need greater challenges.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91154" id2="17" version="1065353216">So I must recover these holograms, and watch for Flesh Raiders. Where should I begin?</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91154" id2="17" version="1065353216">I understand my task.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91155" id2="17" version="1065353216">There's a difference between a challenge and risking your student's life.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91155" id2="17" version="1065353216">I disagree. This is dangerous.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91156" id2="17" version="1065353216">If Yuon believes you ready for a true test, you must be ready.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91158" id2="17" version="1065353216">I was hoping you'd treat my abilities with the respect they deserve.</text>
		<text bitflag="5456" id1="91158" id2="17" version="1065353216">Good, you know my worth.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91159" id2="17" version="1065353216">Pride is not a Jedi virtue, Padawan, nor is overconfidence.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91161" id2="17" version="1065353216">The holograms are in the Gnarls. Be vigilant; that region has dangers of its own. If you encounter any difficulties, contact me on this holocommunicator.</text>
		<text bitflag="5441" id1="91163" id2="17" version="1065353216">When you have the holograms, meet me at the Jedi Temple. We have much to discuss.</text>
		<text bitflag="1345" id1="91165" id2="17" version="1065353216">A good day to you.</text>
